This then made me think about photography and polaroids. The most common 1/1 in photography. So with this collection I decided to merge both concepts and make it my own. Each NFT will be available as a 1/1 as a digital snapshot I have created from my own work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbxBSiu5PZyvrhKPJwf1uodYgJnFumWXnL1jLndxAgMcr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbKBKodJgWgCV6vaoGvhhhadmuChLNinFYhzm9cm2Z8RS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbxBSiu5PZyvrhKPJwf1uodYgJnFumWXnL1jLndxAgMcr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ecKRfFyXBCuSfniEMYuU1vZPT6jJCr2aj"], "tags": ["nftphotography", "photography", "soar", "digitalsnapshot"], "extra": {}}
