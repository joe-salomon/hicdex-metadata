Many of these images are smaller fragments of larger pieces and have been framed in a particular way. Again, the framing of something, whether it be visual or mental is a strong concept that occupies a lot of my thinking on the subject of memory. These artworks have been crafted with thoughtful insight and tender loving care. On a technical level, they mix home-brewed generative systems with hand-drawn images using Processing and GANs. \n\nSize : 2085X 2085 PNG [bitmap image]\n2021 | Mark Webster @motiondesign_01", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXiDiWFLELVyhQF7KFfsxhoYXdPqATF3hPiNscMWgdTmP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVcJfHYJPyiUVt9hn6khvZ1MRUSowd4hYbPxr3WvGx8EZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVQKAgnLouA4ctj188u9989PPGPkbDytfAFR2FLQaLK4H", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXiDiWFLELVyhQF7KFfsxhoYXdPqATF3hPiNscMWgdTmP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iZbRAAsj6GfhPqiX3yCoW8F1cw7oXrxG1"], "tags": ["GANs", "neuralnet", "generative", "drawing", "Processing", "markwebster", "memory", "modular"], "extra": {}}
