Bonafont had been since 25 years ago consuming approximately 1 million and 400 thousand liters of water everyday until they didnt leave any for the people of Juan C. Bonilla. I saw on the news that as soon as they stopped production water continued to flow on people's houses again... a day after the big news that Bonafont had been shut down i went to the nearest place i could to actually get a bottle of water with this news at the moment totally out of my mind, and was very impressed to see that ALL Bonafont bottles had been taken out of the store and thrown away. i stood infront of the refrigerator, smiled and couldnt help to take a picture and say outloud: \u201cno more Bonafont, hu?\u201d to which the guy who worked there replied: \u201cNo more Bonafont, just Ciel.\u201d", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQUhzsv68QLai5nVqpZypxxGXddfXYdnNBkCxwpodh3th", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQUhzsv68QLai5nVqpZypxxGXddfXYdnNBkCxwpodh3th", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQUhzsv68QLai5nVqpZypxxGXddfXYdnNBkCxwpodh3th", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hgdyB1cCRz1uLH5RNwrRcyHxxURibnG4G"], "tags": ["water", "psychedelicphotography", "mexico", "ciel", "bonafont", "glitche"], "extra": {}}
