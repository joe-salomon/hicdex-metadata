In Posada's words, \"Death is democratic, since at the end of the day, blond, dark, rich or poor, all people end up being skulls.\" This skull was not wearing clothes, only a hat; It was later Diego Rivera who portrayed her as we know her today. He painted her in elegant clothing, typical of a catr\u00edn: a well-dressed and adorned man. This was the typical image of the aristocracy of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. La Catrina was born from La Calavera Garbancera \u201d.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTju3nQaerts3Gb5PuUrfRApjrBiXEm3eArfkYDcrG52B", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTarcxVmhxxZjbtDAEQs9AxhykDPakAbXym7tooKbzA3y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTju3nQaerts3Gb5PuUrfRApjrBiXEm3eArfkYDcrG52B", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4Q8g7vx5EXGysLkWridBqnbjJXikMYSu"], "tags": ["catrina", "catrin", "couple", "Mexico", "skull", "portrait", "photography"], "extra": {}}
