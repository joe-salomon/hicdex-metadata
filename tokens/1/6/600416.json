I deliberately changed it to black and white to increase the nostalgia that was in it.\n\nAt the time, I didn't have a basic understanding of photography. With my mother's pocket camera, I enjoy doing snapshots of objects and sights that I find interesting.\n\nI learned a lot about the changes that have been made in me. I learned a lot about photography since 2016 and got myself to this point and will continue to learn over and over again.\n\nThank you so much for all the support so far. I am so grateful to be in such a supportive community.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPBwUVYjwwtCM3zx5eC2qLWVJCWFPK6GUtY5Ayx8hm7y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeJgcTYoV5b9DEzRxdjTFNTiASLH5DhQzM4KGr23zJE7c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPBwUVYjwwtCM3zx5eC2qLWVJCWFPK6GUtY5Ayx8hm7y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2GdJsgsbXs7MwcMNCrcNgf87Fy1NNtsVKC"], "tags": ["photography", "blackandwhite", "yugaknow"], "extra": {}}
