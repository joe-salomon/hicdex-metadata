You know, that hidden part which most of the time we don't declare even to ourselves. I've always been fascinated by the impulse of the human being, because it has no race or gender, because it is completely free from society rules and there is no right or wrong. Look, all my subjects are people with whom i have established a deep relationship, people that i have dedicated a large amount of my time to me and that have lived significant experiences with. During this process I tend to push the boundaries of my relationships in order to get in this \"super private\" space that usually is hidden by layers of dignity, fear, decency, expectations. And it's in that precise place that i give birth to my artwork...\"  This is a slow animation, built to restore a sense of calm and inner peace precisely in having found a lost part within oneself. The material body breathes delicately while the rediscovered part plays joyfully.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaiLTU5Dtpmti2s82c8RyMUvmLhRgwSp231RGz2L6CrkC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUX4Rt8ppEd5FwKPxH6RxZZJEVPZG5YunPBp4xojumRcb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaiLTU5Dtpmti2s82c8RyMUvmLhRgwSp231RGz2L6CrkC", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Q4LMVVRhDk7dWUpLWHFPDnxj5uN5V3WWp"], "tags": ["Findings", "superprivate", "desire", "colors", "animation", "simone", "simonemiani", "miani", "hidden", "humanbeing", "figurative", "free", "art", "discovery"], "extra": {}}
