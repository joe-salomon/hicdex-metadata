Historical painting where the first personal computer desktop is the subject.\n\nThe error dialog with a bomb icon was one of the strongest visual statement of the Macintosh interface. The dialog (and bomb) appeared when an application had crashed, crashing the whole system with it. Instead of minimizing the crash, the bomb icon made it a whole visual event in itself, using the graphical language of comics and cartoons.\n\nYou can learn more about the Macintosh bomb icon by listening to Susan Kare: https://vimeo.com/97583369. She talks about designing the icon for the error dialog starting at 4:34. \n\nThe microdesktop series is inspired by the black and white interface of the first Macintosh in 1984 and its small 512 \u00d7 342 pixels, black and white (no greys), 9\" screen.\n\nDesigner and artists had to use every pixels and find ways around the limitations, leading to beautiful 1-bit icons, backgrounds and illustrations.\n\nThe original resolution of this piece is much 10 times smaller than an original Macintosh desktop at 51 \u00d7 34 pixels only. The actual final image file is scaled up 8 times, to be visible on modern computers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfYCwkMcaE4dZveHLFJFJwwwuJtLudmCp4jc5Hs1rGPFi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfYCwkMcaE4dZveHLFJFJwwwuJtLudmCp4jc5Hs1rGPFi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfYCwkMcaE4dZveHLFJFJwwwuJtLudmCp4jc5Hs1rGPFi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VhN58tCJbboQQoyTgLWoCwDUXBidfcAgd"], "tags": ["computer", "blackandwhite", "history", "1bit", "icons", "80s", "pixelart", "macintoshb&w", "lowres", "interface", "1984", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
