The Gold variant is the lowest in supply, hence the highest in value and the opposite is true for the Bronze variant. The Silver variant sits somewhere in the middle.\n\n1. The Bronze variant has 100 editions.\n2. The Silver variant has 25 editions.\n3. The Gold variant has 5 editions.\n\nMonke Madness can be a great addition to your existing collection or the start of a new, it can be great to show to your friends or to admire the endless loop by yourself. Monke Madness is for everyone, regardless of budget, hence the existence of 3 different variants.
