A metaverse like no other.\n\nThe second replaced reality. All consciousness, the last shred of soul, were all converted into bits. \n\nThe third wave saw the collapse. The singularity peered into the void.

Bits and pieces of meta-reality.\n\n// loopymoon // 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY85JosqcGFza9TG3b85pEQvhpdTahGjWVdCiz8DyMPs8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZh1B7TwaRchLc4NRQNsboXbhtqK89sgvuzMS7vFQKHnj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY85JosqcGFza9TG3b85pEQvhpdTahGjWVdCiz8DyMPs8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iiMWaRHGLTqawxnSMBYZmJ2byCBUBS3Vr"], "tags": ["gan", "loopyverse", "consciousness", "monochrome", "onchain", "metaverse", "singularity", "metareality"], "extra": {}}
