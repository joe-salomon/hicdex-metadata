Usually this ghost flies at a low altitude from one place to another in the form of a fireball.\n\nThe myth that occurs in society is that if this ghost sees a human, he will definitely turn into a blazing fire and will pounce on his prey to death. Old people always advised if you meet a ghost, you must be naked and run.\n\nAnother form of banaspati is the form of a fireman whose whole body from head to toe is lit and emits light like flames like burning a bonfire.
