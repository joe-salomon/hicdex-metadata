Work, responsibility, pressure, it's a bunch of things that make us think \"where did I stop?\", \"Where did I get lost?\". Life seems to play with us in some hypotheses, in order to prove to us something we can't see.\nThis piece was created with the aim of showing a disconnection, a moment of peace, away from everything and everyone, moving away from life to find your own life. Sometimes it's best to let go of everything and find ourselves.\n\n_____\n\n\n4975 x 3433", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVZkWQxd8dTBMsN4nSiJqikcfRYkttUvi2ofuPeJR3ww8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTsJvQnwMGRiUCW1gso1CtkRSVvjqxkW7YKUTUGP368DE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVZkWQxd8dTBMsN4nSiJqikcfRYkttUvi2ofuPeJR3ww8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XooZufYT4cEzACR9gdyoeDBtuoYtXq8YY"], "tags": ["life", "sentimental", "loneliness", "reflection", "thought", "deep"], "extra": {}}
