The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUabTNnRRXdt5cqRzS7TCjQhbTaTgh8ferAaxyTjQxhYm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUabTNnRRXdt5cqRzS7TCjQhbTaTgh8ferAaxyTjQxhYm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUabTNnRRXdt5cqRzS7TCjQhbTaTgh8ferAaxyTjQxhYm", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QSY36Uxt4wzepwu9GQ6CFuVcpNpAVkmgy"], "tags": ["cca", "146"], "extra": {}}
