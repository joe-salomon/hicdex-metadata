Beacon wouldn't be the song it is without them.\nFor the visual side, I used an ultrasound image of my son and fed it the individual sounds of the song to create an audio controlled visualiser.\nI hope you like it.\n\u2028-AA\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmREvMfKFpefAqvJWouLBPmKdHrXCxUb4finkcGyttgFt1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZcLZEkzrXSPvyAJ5HwKWh6EpyT357mzAEENPRAkjESgL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmREvMfKFpefAqvJWouLBPmKdHrXCxUb4finkcGyttgFt1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1St9SwBjyJQAisKSWkhocVNoshV8fNSJCk"], "tags": ["audio", "audio/visual", "art", "music", "electronicmusic", "dance", "emotion", "generative"], "extra": {}}
