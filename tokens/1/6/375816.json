What was that? You try to focus, and notice a cozy breeze coming from the mirror, how could that be? Suddenly, this aura becomes stronger, a sweet yet fresh perfume seems to be caressing your cheeks, you can smell it from the inside of chest, just like you can feel a gentle flutter from inside your eardrums.\nFrom the rightmost corner, a purple stain. But you're wise, and you try to see with your heart instead of your human eyes. You recognize this silhouette, it feels somewhat familiar. A fairy with a cheeky smile stares at you from the other side. You hear her snicker, but not with your ears, her laughter sounds like the rustle of leaves and the chirping of baby birds in spring, you couldn't put it into words even if you tried.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZkb3hBcLPRf18fN9FfNrRdDD46yY97JbvdtHLTQfyaoz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZGmWiuRAtjQTiEe28KKpNrFRoPBeeE31uMP4YrTfJ3Uy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZkb3hBcLPRf18fN9FfNrRdDD46yY97JbvdtHLTQfyaoz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1L9EYVNVtK1S8cNEdAxmMaw3TgFjApHFgc"], "tags": ["witchinghouronhen", "fairy", "magic", "mirror", "flower", "spring", "sopa"], "extra": {}}
