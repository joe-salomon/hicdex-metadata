It doesn't feel like the future. Or alternatively, it doesn't feel as if the 21st Century has started yet. We remain trapped in the 20th century.\"\n-Original audio produced by James Alec Hardy 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifikjb7ccnz77ozszl3pxapgkcdy5uom577jowtajvn2nzvwdo7su", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicumhqxbkao4nrodtucmqryu5xclbg3hqwavt7api7hqk6kv6hzwi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifikjb7ccnz77ozszl3pxapgkcdy5uom577jowtajvn2nzvwdo7su", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1KvdAPtHVuSW1HtgNzZk3EVPdx6cK6BqQU"], "tags": ["Objkt4objkt", "objkt4objkt3", "markfisher", "postmodernism", "k-punk", "video", "philosophy", "RIP", "anamorphic", "Goldsmiths", ""], "extra": {}}
