{"__version": 1, "token_id": 404416, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ESO SI QUE ES", "description": "English is such an amazing language to play with, but it's not the only one out there. Spanish is another language that has many audible and visual overlaps with English. Here we have the words in Spanish that say: \"Eso si que es\", which roughly translates to, \"that is what it is\". Underneath we have the phonetically pronounced words as English letters S O C K S that spell the word SOCKS. Are these bizarre coincidences that are seemingly pointless pseudo-intellectual dribble? Probably, but that's for you, the reader, to decide. My journey is to think, locate, and replicate these phenomena. During this time period I began to experiment with other languages to see if there were any of these hidden gems. They are out there and I am open to receiving that message.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZVLb3apLERANCM1fHeeQWFo5PFdKYZtGBrEmTgPhzEc5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSTJKZfLqaU1LPGFA1UbCC28i1wJTu8f1An5unJzDToxY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZVLb3apLERANCM1fHeeQWFo5PFdKYZtGBrEmTgPhzEc5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
