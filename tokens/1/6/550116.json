Coming home from my first paying job with more than $20 felt like a win because honestly anything more than $0 felt like a win. Even then, the money called out that these ones, fives, and tens weren't enough, that anyone with REAL money wouldn't bat an eye - I have to work harder, be smarter, and maybe then I'll be safe. I listened to the money, clinging on to every loose bill and every coin that came my way in the years to come.\n\nA decade later and I realize there is no \"feeling safe\" with money in our current system. Money is power and so many of us are powerless, trapped in a cycle of counting change to have enough for somebody who scoffs at a dollar. \n\nSelf portrait, 2012.\nDigital.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXUTzCiaxvW91RNE27ERdjXDgSoYQVXnCsnQTnGkHZWzU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRaNU7Za4weTLg6SbQPYD5Mf6vHoiKd8mEzZ6XoHwV72t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWfo98peJpRaqXLnYYKLFkEninc4SQEesEtsUDnNSh4Pj", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXUTzCiaxvW91RNE27ERdjXDgSoYQVXnCsnQTnGkHZWzU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XduX9RUaE6TpiviVogP4rTxTBpGuqvgjR"], "tags": ["money", "portrait", "photography", "USD", "capitalism", "capital", "consume", "moneyonmymind", "digital", "change", "crypto"], "extra": {}}
