Autobiographical abstraction.\n\nBINARY pieces obey a set of rules in that they must be constructed using only 2 x white blocks on a black canvas. With these constraints, each canvas is an abstract representation of an autobiographical tale. \n\nSEVEN PM\n--------\nThe clock hovers on the fifty-ninth minute for as long as it can - time on its tiptoes, waiting for gravity to do the dirty work of turning our lives upside down.\nI wait on one side of the door, you on the other. Despite this, I know at Seven pm you'll breeze in here as if you haven't been thinking about the pitch of your 'Hello' since I first told you what time to arrive.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWFzAP8aDWxRDkn2MkZgm5xyChPcMFVbzur9xyoVNsa9p", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSNkupbfsfj1fYzvM9fUMDyLHwmgmqESL5thtFnSbF9Gu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWFzAP8aDWxRDkn2MkZgm5xyChPcMFVbzur9xyoVNsa9p", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WqiSCF73e2YK85VL2EXrgL5oti3AkJEKf"], "tags": ["abstract", "abstractart", "binary", "abstractexpressionism", "minimalism", "minimalistart", "poetry", "literary", "literature"], "extra": {}}
