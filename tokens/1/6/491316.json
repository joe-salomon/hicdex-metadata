To recognize your divine energy, to feel and exploit our own flow, as well as to be thankful for our earthly vessel and how it leads us through this world.\n\nYou can choose to do it as an ointment if you want to apply it before a shower, or even better, place all the ingredients in a tub with warm water and take this bath under moon light. Feel all the essences and relax, visualice this card in your min. Once you are done you can wash the ingredients when you please.\n\nYou'll need the following:\n- Honey\n- White rose petals for love\n- Comfrey for healing\n- Holy basil for protection and recognition of your own divinity\n\nHope you enjoy it.
