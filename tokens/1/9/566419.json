Several teachers have asked how to introduce the activity to their students, so I have decided to collate the ideas and resources from my original twitter thread here.\nThe word \u2018mandala\u2019 means \u2018circle\u2019 in Sanskrit, and mandalas have a deep spiritual or cosmic meaning in many cultures and traditions. For our #Maydala purposes, a mandala is any circular design exhibiting pattern and symmetry.\nMandala making is accessible to all. The repetitive nature of these designs means that drawing them can be a wonderfully absorbing and meditative process, and it's a process that results in stunning geometrical patterns - bonus!\nDesigns can be drawn entirely freehand, or using a mixture of freehand and compass/ruler construction, or solely compass and ruler construction. Anything goes! Some participants are even using technology or origami to make their mandalas, with stunning results\n\nhttps://www.artfulmaths.com/blog/mandala-may-hem#:~:text=Mandalas%20are%20rich%20in%20mathematics,including%20rulers%2C%20compasses%20and%20protractors.&text=The%20word%20'mandala'%20means%20',in%20many%20cultures%20and%20traditions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ5zYViyH3a9FKjFefjnVmNQoVGkvHEvkbDt5QhX6LWdD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRbvYHPmegVceK4GvMsEBhBGkVCXmMbf8Hz6T9heG21ra", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ5zYViyH3a9FKjFefjnVmNQoVGkvHEvkbDt5QhX6LWdD", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RRX8VXmeAXTx2erqqX6vxewN2ss5xWSVs"], "tags": ["math", "mandala", "animation", "creative", "heart", "love", "feeling"], "extra": {}}
