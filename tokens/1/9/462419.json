I believe and hoping this bonfire will keep us warm and alive\n\nVisual : Aloysius Nitia\nMusic  : At.Nite\nFormat : 2080 x 2080, mp4, Wav.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaJE2zFswWCvVsADwbM45RdBMWXASmpS7JbJ89PYoWtZy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX7X1U6ZAUqAT67YGZELoZUJC2pzvX14n3FnZrU5WCZLt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaJE2zFswWCvVsADwbM45RdBMWXASmpS7JbJ89PYoWtZy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1c4t2CxffMwPNbSEmQMAQ5fMek8VEABvvN"], "tags": ["aloysiusnitia", "audio", "3d", "animated", "instrumental", "lofi", "music", "nftasia", "nftmusic", "nftaudio", "nftasia", "henradio", "tune4tune"], "extra": {}}
