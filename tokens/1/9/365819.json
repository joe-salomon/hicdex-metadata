The chest is deep and broad and the legs powerful and well muscled. The head is wedged shaped, with a 'squareness' to the jaw. The large, wide set, tufted ears help give it a wild look. The Ocicat's coat is short and sleek with a satin texture. The spots are well scattered in a distinctive pattern on the sides of the body, shoulders and hindquarters, extending down the legs and on to the belly. The forehead displays the distinctive tabby 'M'. The tail shows alternate spots and rings of darker colour ending with a dark tip. The Ocicat comes in many colours.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmet74WR9441hGsUiEV5Yk9avoB4cZuCmesMPZz5Ys2Ax3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmet74WR9441hGsUiEV5Yk9avoB4cZuCmesMPZz5Ys2Ax3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmet74WR9441hGsUiEV5Yk9avoB4cZuCmesMPZz5Ys2Ax3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["objkt4objkt", "cat", "pet", "animal", "pixelart", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
