The package will contain several exclusive pieces from the trips throughout the various metaverses he travels.\n\n3\u00b0 - This gem will work as exclusive access to all projects, events, parties, dinners and exhibitions of Mr.Walkscapes in any metaverse or city in the world.\n\n\nAll collectors who retrieve some of my 250 precious gems will participate in exclusive giveaways, raffles, and will have exclusive access to some of my treasures once I return to H = N. I'm grateful for the help of all the astute collectors in this metaverse, should they so choose find me I moved these days to Twitter, there I live as @Mr.Walkscapes.tez\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWAC1M2dYRi5oSA44ZAJ4wKuL7Gb1NnP5PFryTN69Lb3U", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUZno6pNn85GSwJf7zufeeuTG5pAtw4TpRt3eXZJ15zUN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWAC1M2dYRi5oSA44ZAJ4wKuL7Gb1NnP5PFryTN69Lb3U", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1ZKjejFa9MVpSjybppsgvV4iVhLHV5iv4H"], "tags": ["SrWalkscapes", "gems", "stones", "3d", "glb", "AcessToken", "ecology", "vrart", "hicetnunc", "sculptrvr", "vrartist", "hicetnunc2000", "cleannft", "nftcollectibles", "digitalart", "animation", "3dart"], "extra": {}}
