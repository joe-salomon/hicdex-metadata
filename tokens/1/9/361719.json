For me, it is a great subject for photography and always catches my eye. For people, it is a tasty snack in the form of seeds. For birds, it is a valuable source of energy to prepare for winter. There is another use that makes time very enjoyable. My son and I love to watch the tits pecking at the sunflower seeds. The tits do this in a very clever way. First, they find and sit in a safe place from where they can see the sunflower. Once they are sure that there is no danger nearby, they fly to the sunflower and peck out one seed. They return to a safe location and there tear the husk off the seed. In particular, it looks great when a whole group of tits takes turns doing this.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPWWfQq6KjLWPHBrK5X53H4oEiGpeoQBYKbEnugRhG3My", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ3vn22Rx3ASBFZgSh7Zyqr1GNg1GJ6zAtqjwQMi2RXAr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPWWfQq6KjLWPHBrK5X53H4oEiGpeoQBYKbEnugRhG3My", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QGnFHUB1NX7mBvBDg85CMUrpXPWKLg4aW"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "colors", "saturation", "light", "beauty", "camera", "flower", "grass", "sunset", "sunflower"], "extra": {}}
