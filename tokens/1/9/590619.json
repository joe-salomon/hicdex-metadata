This one is special because I was drawing this while also coping with my own wounded heart. During that time, I slowly realised that my self-love is so low that I often hurting myself and others around me. Just like how I let my beautiful cactus plants in my room came to their end.\n\nIt took so much times to where I am now, not that I've learned how to love myself, but the fact that I'm aware and exercising with being gentle with myself and having a more positive self-talk is already a huge step for me.\n\nThis Cactus Heart deserves to live.
