Because this is entering the cycle of the third decade of my life. I am very grateful and this feeling is sufficient to represent myself, which is still given my breath until this moment. Everything starts with one and there is always a shadow.\n\n\nOne shadow, one life, always following every footstep. Being a protector and reflecting on the world in a different way to live life.\n\nregards\nRanselusang", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPBfTB1hFratGAmdrhHhx9kfYJ8CuZe7tV4FBxpWZwSh9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPyLnkgij9VSyzffC5LnrA1bQAQazMPUcneAQg5kNRMBG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPBfTB1hFratGAmdrhHhx9kfYJ8CuZe7tV4FBxpWZwSh9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["reflection", "photography", "human", "minimalist", "indonesia"], "extra": {}}
