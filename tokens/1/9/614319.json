It is also the month of healing and overcoming limitations. You can connect to the energy of the month by meditating on the Aramaic letters embedded in this mixed media digital piece of art. I used a mix of personal video footage of myself and places in London and illustration. \n\nIt is part of my Z0D14C-22 collection, 12 part collection. This is number 04. \n\nThroughout the year I will release one piece (3 eds / mp4) for each of the months. It is a mixed media project including sound and visuals created by me. \n\nFor more updates on releases, please follow on Twitter or Instagram. \n\nGo to http://christianroman.studio for more info about my work. \n\nC4NC3R-22 by Christian Roman", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU1FAkS7ti43ocjjo8gfheqzACczN66ZBnVHv5gYaSmci", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1aBWRZZSGsYaJR3zXCcuFXnJgYtDVzUjVR7GgdoGdPx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU1FAkS7ti43ocjjo8gfheqzACczN66ZBnVHv5gYaSmci", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Tvp7xuVdiNBsLFn4iaref6vfGzVBv9yjo"], "tags": ["digital", "mixedmedia", "illustration", "zodiac", "video", "London", "cancer", "moon", "christianroman", "mp4", "sound", "Z0D14C-22"], "extra": {}}
