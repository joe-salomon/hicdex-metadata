{"__version": 1, "token_id": 565519, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Same Coin", "description": "Same Coin is an art piece depicting two scenes. On one side is a cityscape with the sun hanging behind the buildings. The other side shows the city again, only at night. Both sides implement colors corresponding to the time of day, the sun side using warm colors while the moon side uses colds, not counting the moon itself. The buildings in both use gray as a main color. \nThe main theme of the piece is a show of dichotomy. One side represents the idyllic scene of day while the other shows the strange time of night. The day side features a broad view of the sky with birds flying through the buildings showing depth. On the night side, nothing is what it appears to be, with the moon being shown as a banana or the smoke of the chimney being cotton. It plays on the phrase, \u201ctwo sides of the same coin.\u201d\nAs to how it was made, the day side features an airbrush quality. It is evident that it was painted digitally. The night side is cut up and made with varying textures. The moon is cut up as a banana, the sky is literally made with paint texture, and the smoke uses cotton. Both sides contain qualities quite opposite of each other, yet work together to create two scenes of the same sky. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNvw7bH21Txq1MYKrxACmvwDogV1yzPfmYwqP8TVBrK9X", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmey4d1eSGv7xyZjjHV25tBJ7QjPuTHVKHjtU8ejLugr7e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNvw7bH21Txq1MYKrxACmvwDogV1yzPfmYwqP8TVBrK9X", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2AeGDWrLi8denK5h3R8rbofq1sCKnuGnYF"], "tags": ["Sky", "Sun", "Coin", "Moon", "Banana", "City", "NFT"], "extra": {}}
