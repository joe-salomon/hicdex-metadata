Everyone considered the lights that covered it to be an ode to the deaths of many. What none knew was that it was also the beginning. For every death, there was an emergence. A birth. As one died and as one came to life, a light was down and a new one replaced it. After aeons of this, a part breaking from the universe was considered an ill omen by many. Even 300, with it's infinite knowledge rushed to it's aid. It was understood much later, as the piece that broke from the surface, was the death of the beginning and the birth of a new one.
