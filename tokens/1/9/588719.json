Each Poster-comic presents a different and auto conclusive story, although at the same time these stories cross their paths and are connected to each other.\n\nHandmade drawing, digital color.\n2500x3536 pixels", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNTXbHUCiaxbBWJda31xnvguy3SvxkivotcznfTtfNzHx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSyQVRYKkpvHa653Bq3xQocmG1rJWshJSrPkPZhsyGWkV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNTXbHUCiaxbBWJda31xnvguy3SvxkivotcznfTtfNzHx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cicJW6zjuqNTRjKMumwiPySsnhvyxAby3"], "tags": ["silenceofnobodies", "postercomics", "estudiokodixe", "comics", "story", "metaphysics", "jpg"], "extra": {}}
