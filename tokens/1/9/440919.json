A ready to drink bottle of Nuka-Cola and rum boasting an alcohol-by-volume content of 35%, the beverage was touted as 'the most thirst-quenching way to unwind.' Those partaking in the drink were recommended to not operate motor vehicles or heavy machinery for at least eight hours after drinking, and encourage women who are pregnant or may become pregnant to avoid the drink. Still, it found success in many of the finer lounges and restaurants across the nation. It can be found after the war in locations such as the Nuka-World theme-park in the Boston Commonwealth, or at the Appalachian Whitespring Resort.\"\n\n*Not permitted for children under 12 years old*", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUsXWbP8Lsvh4DSBLxd8o9uCWqjHXQxHHhhDeEGVu5vET", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRCUmo3ZCizpRzBB3XUZ1wm2TxtjgT3QQQvSnRwvfGpXs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUsXWbP8Lsvh4DSBLxd8o9uCWqjHXQxHHhhDeEGVu5vET", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Y45h6xg2y9WWHGZRszV35eSQgZQG927zG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dart", "3dartist", "3danimation", "3drender", "looping", "loop", "loopinggif", "fallout", "nukacola", "bottlecap", "shrednector", "objkt4objkjt"], "extra": {}}
