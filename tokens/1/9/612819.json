The funny thing is that, with the phone, I shoot mostly landscapes, which I don't usually do with my reflex.\nSo I decided to mint some of it in a special edition of 10, 100 pcs each at 1 XTZ.\nEvery picture has its own story, its own moment, its own place. \nPlease, enjoy it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeBGE39jgtnG5D7nD4PWH5NtkGyVpWQDM8RgvZAPSDw2V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdLQTDEPMm418ssJ2AbPRQkqdJEDWrvwgE4MLNvQtcRMm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXMa95u1rb1jW23u5fQibYBM7sz9C8RopaVczHCi6KVXo", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeBGE39jgtnG5D7nD4PWH5NtkGyVpWQDM8RgvZAPSDw2V", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZpmbuFzaLx8Gzut2vPnEW245FsbVhkNKv"], "tags": ["smarphonephotography", "photography", "landscape", "moody", "photographer", "limitededition", "smartphone", "phone"], "extra": {}}
