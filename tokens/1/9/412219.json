Glitch meets databending. \nThe first time Geisha gif was published on Tumblr in 2014 on Dirty New Media microblog.\nThe gif count to date 03/10/2021 33,229 notes since Nov 24th, 2016 on Domenico's Tumblr http://dombarra.tumblr.com On http://dirtynewmedia.tumblr.com (now offline) it reached +130.000.\nThe loop was glitched by altering the data in the stream of the .gif format. Then, it was processed through dithering. \n\nAnother Domenico's piece remixed in this visual is HeartGlitchBeat. It was his thank you to Hic Et Nunc community.\n\nDigital Noise Frontier added the heavy noise beat, editing and it's own glitch style .\n\nFile MPEG 4 Codec H.264", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWpePfypzTzYeH9EV3oTV8g5vodmg7vU1jZYDkSyK1Ev1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYVYPJpjuv91xmfqPxJTmigNVkMticYaVn9ELUPJQcqS3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWpePfypzTzYeH9EV3oTV8g5vodmg7vU1jZYDkSyK1Ev1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bshAEXA9MaGJCbAo5McnXLuexzBW1dhzH"], "tags": ["glitch", "databending", "gif", "geisha", "heartglitchedbeat", "noise", "beat", "dithering", "XXXTentacion", "zerkey"], "extra": {}}
