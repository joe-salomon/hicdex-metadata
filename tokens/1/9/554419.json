Click on the Poor Circus Performers cover image to start. Then you can click on any of the digital keys to play a sound-bite from the movie. There is also a backing music track that you can play too. All artwork is original by Guiding Rock.\nThe UI/UX was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And I spent several hours collecting sound-bites and turning them into audio samples that I then assigned to keys on my MIDI keyboard. The backing music track is also original.\n\nIf the keys aren't working, try refreshing the page.\nHave fun and enjoy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY1fvqikcDuCkuBb99pe59hzMz8wtcz8aN1ViZnMxTtHs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSiZG7Q3zHwVhJfFewZ79aNLr6H36TAQJdvhDe6QqySa4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY1fvqikcDuCkuBb99pe59hzMz8wtcz8aN1ViZnMxTtHs", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hnmpvKPDDnXfh9tkE2ouWG2rP3uaUVjC4"], "tags": ["theprincessbride", "digital", "audio", "music", "soundbite", "rare", "movie", "interactive", "MIDI", "electronic", "html", "css", "javascript", "keyboard", "original"], "extra": {}}
