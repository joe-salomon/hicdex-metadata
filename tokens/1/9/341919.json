It is quite common to find such vendors selling their stuff on streets in India. They sells food, goods and merchandise on the street or in an open-air market rather than at a traditional store, as they can't afford to run a store. They are quite famous among children especially in rural areas, for they supply toys such as balloon, doll, ball, bicycle, train, etc. By seeing such street vendors in the street, kids weep and insist on buying some toys.
