I interned in NYC in the early Winter of 2006 and while I was there I fell ass backwards into the world of Designer Toys. It started with Kidrobot and evolved to a whole world of amazing figures that had a lush and broad history. 15 years later and I'm still collecting toys and I couldn't even tell you how many I have.
