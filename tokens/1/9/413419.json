The most gentle and gracious to people and cares for them although they may be oblivious to his acts. His nature is kind, affectionate, and understanding for the subtle details of individual circumstances. His actions are so fine and subtle they can not be apprehended by us by any means. He does things for you, you will never know. This is the name of Allah to call when asking for help through hardship.\n\nDo you not see that Allah has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes\ngreen? Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted. (Quran 22:63)\n\n[And Luqman said], \u201cO my son, indeed if wrong should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted. (Quran 31:16)\n\nAnd remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom. Indeed, Allah is ever Subtle and Acquainted [with all things].
