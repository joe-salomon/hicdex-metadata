{"__version": 1, "token_id": 552319, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "WORDS DON'T EXPRESS MY MEANING.", "description": "In the classic rock song, \"2HB\" from the legendary band, Roxy Music, the lyrics 'words don't express my meaning' are sung with a beguiling vibrato that just sticks in your mind like chewing gum on the bottom of your shoes. In this work, we use this lyric as a way to introduce their work to a larger audience. More over, 'WORDS DON'T EXPRESS MY MEANING', has an entendre onto itself. The irony of using on these words to give meaning to the work is that the actual words themselves negate this meaning. Or, by using the words, \"WORDS DON'T EXPRESS MY MEANING\", we're creating a verbal contradiction feedback loop. We're saying something that negates the actual words used to say those very things. If we're saying words don't express my meaning, but these words are the very words use to express my meaning...it's a bit of a conundrum.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWUctVPaKeMNoeYjuaw5rv3HbTovtasvSYzArk88qaWMY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXEfNBQjJizfTjxfbRGDRjUzRnG6KCt3AF2fe1fX5GdjY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWUctVPaKeMNoeYjuaw5rv3HbTovtasvSYzArk88qaWMY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
