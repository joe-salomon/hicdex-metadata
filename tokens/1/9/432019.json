I\u2019m in Amsterdam and the festival is in NZ so it\u2019s been extra special for me. \n\nThe artwork I made for the festival is a glitched video loop so I\u2019ve handpainted one of the stills to show you.\n\nIn this image a man is falling and breaking into a million pieces while others watch on. \nHe gets caught though. I think trusting that we will get caught if we break into a million pieces is really important. Sometimes other people catch us. Sometimes we catch ourselves.\n\nPersonal daily art story\nNumber 17 #STOREEZ by Cat Brown/ Treasvre Trove ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma7LqkxYoQ4mrJ4fwy4xtRDPj17vZxhA2vP2CscX2EemN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSGZEhsRq8ZBquQiFRydhRYQQr94QjsPFBTedx45zuB12", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma7LqkxYoQ4mrJ4fwy4xtRDPj17vZxhA2vP2CscX2EemN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Xu1CazAffNXnBZcgA23nt8QbvP44LLxGh"], "tags": ["#STOREEZ", "catbrown", "painting", "glitch", "tradglitch", "TreasvreTrove"], "extra": {}}
