Infamous ruler of three countries, 16 islands, and at least two fashion brands. He tells everyone (even when they didn\u2019t ask) that he was only kicked out of heaven because God himself got jealous of his \u201cskill, charm, and overall talent\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to confirm whether this is actually true, but The King sure acts like it is. Armed with several magical artifacts he rules with an iron fist, at least when he\u2019s not blackout drunk.\n\nSo far he had a total of 8 portraits made of him. The 6th one, stolen by The Collector, is pictured above.\"\n\n\nBuy his unique PORTRAIT today!\nThank you for supporting young and upcoming artists :)\n\n\nCHECK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION:\nrevols.squarespace.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUrQJ8yqzoXE4F2VoeiE2DepTqy5F1eceVJADcGVdhxmQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX1xB9jnUFaZaAhy9cBdCXSjYhMNadKpSGdg8GLefA8Pp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUrQJ8yqzoXE4F2VoeiE2DepTqy5F1eceVJADcGVdhxmQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bRYF9zNPJ1m6M5rAUjCwL6yNtP2gz4c7F"], "tags": ["art", "photography", "illustration", "digital", "2D", "3D", "painting", "evol", "revol", "gevol", "001", "outlaw", "limited", "highlylimited", "hen", "objkt4objkt", "cheap", "character", "horror", "action", "sword", "snow", "cowboyhat", "demoneye", "orange", "yellow", "mysterious", "10", "camera", "sony", "blur", "motion", "series", "EVOL", "KidEight", "newartist", "artist", "youngartist", "horror", "hen", "eth", "competition", "c4d", "photoshop", "worldbuilding", "beginning", "number1"], "extra": {}}
