But for sure those Rasau tree is home to a lot of fishes, some crocs, maybe a lizard. Humidity that day makes me want to just swim under the water, \"brave enough to swim?\" asking the boatman, \"why not?\" I wonder in my mind forget that he already told me maybe crocs lives there. These swamp peatlands also hold hundred even thousand of years' worth of carbon storage that lies under the water. One of the catfish he caught that day was delicious.\n\nThe Trees and The Life is a 10-Photo-Based-NFT Collection made by Danar Tri Atmojo.
