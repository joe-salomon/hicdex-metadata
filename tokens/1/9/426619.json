He always ends his journey when he arrives in front of the local cemetery. That's when he just disappears without a trace.\n\nWherever he goes, a pack of stray or fugitive dogs follow his amazing trot in an infernal din. From time to time he lashes out the most daring and the yelps can be heard from afar. In front of the yards where there is a trapped dog, he stops and releases the animal.\n\nEventually, he stops outside a house door. At that moment you can hear his panting, something out of this world. At these times, he often scratches at doors or windows with his big, sharp claws. The person is advised to pray the \"Creed\" so that he can then go on his way. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUvbdRgekbMcM65ukodG8NKXXpzKBEPZzq9g97tGfnU6x", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZfh3vfKVA4mSsvW9HTwYnb3A13J3p6yeVzpak81M5zDh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUvbdRgekbMcM65ukodG8NKXXpzKBEPZzq9g97tGfnU6x", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["cryptolegends", "characters", "legends", "forest", "brazil"], "extra": {}}
