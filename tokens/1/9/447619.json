One of a series of real-time programs meditating on the behavior of memories. Allocated memory is iteratively loaded, sorted, and blurred; during this stage of fragility it suffers progressive deterioration and corruption. Once it achieves a maximum state of order or entropy, new memories are allocated and loaded to restart the cycle again. This particular work is the first interactive 3d in the series.
