I actually made this one in 2010 for a graphic arts project. I took it back to 2021, put it in Blender 2.83 and rendered it out in Cycles. \n\nThe wonder of assembling a scale model, bringing it to life, that\u2019s how I enjoy the re-creation and simulation of such an object on my screen. At the same time there\u2019s this picture of emptiness, isolation and artificiality... concepts we can all relate to in this special times we\u2019re in.
