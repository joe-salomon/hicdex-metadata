{"__version": 1, "token_id": 422115, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Armatus Radiata", "description": "--Fig06--\nArmatus Radiata is an Amborellaceae Crustacean creature from Perwana, an exoplanet located 2010 light years away from Earth, orbiting the star Shama.\nArmatus lives in groups of hundreds, which are called \u2018Armatus Plantations\u2019. Their central flowers are huge and can grow up to 4 meters in diameter. The flowers can only be reached by giant insects of Perwana, which can achieve an amazing 12 meters long if they consume Armatus ultra-nutritious pollen every week. Armatus is often referred to as \u2018The Great Pollinator\u2019.\nLand animals from Perwana also want to consume and even eat the whole flower if they can, which will cause the death of Armatus, and that\u2019s why it has 6 to 10 claws to protect the individual from land attacks. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYJg9xhp5DrSKT8T75YCnj9CNxWfyHBnWmu1TgxKgZwT2", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc8Sv11t6MkbiMPQFwzAmR5RTWf4ZwDLbyCM6oz1QaAu3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYJg9xhp5DrSKT8T75YCnj9CNxWfyHBnWmu1TgxKgZwT2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ro3NdaGmfMq9jZNtMUQnWMmA1goKiXPSv"], "tags": ["Crypto", "Darwin", "Animal", "Flower"], "extra": {}}
