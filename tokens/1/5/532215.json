This is a position where both competitors are fighting for control to gain a dominant position.\n\nWhat makes the Muay Thai clinch so different from clinching in other striking combat sports like Boxing or Kickboxing, is that the clinch will not be immediately broken up by the referee.\n\nAs long as there is action going on in the clinch, which means either or both fighters are fighting either for a position or to get in strikes, the clinch is allowed to continue unstopped.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdGZs2YEi9jq7Fzsqqg12KhB19gcKZ1XzF2fYyET4e2VP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTpLmK9tVtGHZMpKMyEnzs8e5PUWGL6Y2hmeEXgoeDG2R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdGZs2YEi9jq7Fzsqqg12KhB19gcKZ1XzF2fYyET4e2VP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QKGs2YxSfMdRGVdP37megEKuV6P1a8tEr"], "tags": ["muaythai", "clinch", "thai", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
