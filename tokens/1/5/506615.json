{"__version": 1, "token_id": 506615, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Grunge on the Catwalk #1", "description": "For a period, the grunge movement glitched the traditional fashion market. The trend was to buy cheap from thrift shops instead of traditional brands. This work glitches the effort of transporting the grunge culture to high fashion status. \n\nThe 1993 Marc Jacobs spring collection for Perry Ellis was an attempt to shift the grunge subculture from its alternative beauty anti-luxury status to fashion prestige.  The outcome, however, was unforeseen.\n\nThe Seattle unpretentious fashion scene had adopted the fleece and fuzzy wools of the fishermen and lumberjacks of the Pacific Northwest out of financial necessity, inadvertently creating an awkward, scruffy look that symbolized a recession-ridden generation disillusioned by 80s greed. \n\nJacobs dressed-down the world top models with colorful layers, Converse All Star sneakers and Robert Crumb\u2019s graphics tees. As far as the reviews were concerned the collection was a complete failure and within a few months Jacobs was surreptitiously fired from Perry Ellis.\n\nNow, 18 years later, this event is being revisited and is now considered a highly innovative, fresh and relevant collection.\n\nTextures, noises and colors generated by a combination of Panasonic WJ-AVE 7 effects, camera feedback and Mismatcher.
