Everything was slower back then (though it wasn\u2019t), but alas, soon after, in 1933, the first shortwave oven was presented to the public, heating up a piece of meat in mere minutes; so fast, finally freeing the hungry people from the shackles of history, it seemed (though it didn\u2019t). Futurist technology, waves so short, becoming even shorter after the war, accelerating, ever shorter, ever faster, trembling, nervous ovens for nervous people, leftover food heated up unevenly, fridge-cold pasta on hot plates, fingertips burned, oh how it hurts. And then some confused person tries to dry their cat in the microwave oven, and Kondratiev, executed in 1938, is crying somewhere.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaTvQnvu8XPc4NVDY742m1PsqaALkuNjwUFsmftVfeoZq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQMdTgN8JxrhJUfL8F31aJDhCMEaRyoT5y8PKRPUwLuCi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaTvQnvu8XPc4NVDY742m1PsqaALkuNjwUFsmftVfeoZq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dozA4bwYBnh3tfNWWbeC3hkAmTeuKXb6f"], "tags": ["abjkt", "economictheory", "economichistory", "acceleration", "modernity", "photography", "readymade"], "extra": {}}
