The key colors remain the same at each parameter reset, but their positions are progressively changed. The upper rectangle is semi-transparent, and the resulting color overlays make each sequence different from the others and virtually infinite.\n\nAntonio Belluscio (@livinbits)\nOctober 2021 (first version: 2015)\n\nInstructions:\n- click or tap \u2192 reset parameters\n- hold down \u2192 display separate rectangles\n- fullscreen and patience \u2192 optimal enjoyment ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcB2M4qLWAmnAFYcMw4ThzY6DaieAWdv4DofJNJ6Y6AGM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaWDiy8juReqsMKCb6wo5hnrkLG8Fki2FrMRER4WoA8Km", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcB2M4qLWAmnAFYcMw4ThzY6DaieAWdv4DofJNJ6Y6AGM", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1PAoZ7RxQrvvC2ceyVR7YGKFmgyLxs1ZEH"], "tags": ["GradientInterference", "generativeArt", "colors", "infinite", "space", "illusion", "gradients", "colorful", "animation", "minimal", "realtime", "generative", "interactive", "random", "interference", "css", "javascript"], "extra": {}}
