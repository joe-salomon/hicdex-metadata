{"__version": 1, "token_id": 335915, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ragdoll Cat", "description": "The Ragdoll cat breed is large, powerful, and imposing with distinctive markings. However, the cat is extremely relaxed and laid back giving the floppy ragdoll impression. The broad head has a flat top and is wide between the ears. The deep blue eyes are large. The body is long and muscular with a broad chest, short neck and sturdy legs. The paws are large round and tufted and the tail is long and bushy. The Ragdoll cat's coat is silky and dense and of medium to long length, and on adult cats there should be a ruff and knickerbockers. There are three different coat patterns in the Ragdoll cat breed and each pattern comes in four colours. There is also a mitted Ragdoll cat with additional white markings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQsQWvbLR29BVHL2EeTL1L9LE3T7uPwyQKtRdn7EouSqE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQsQWvbLR29BVHL2EeTL1L9LE3T7uPwyQKtRdn7EouSqE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQsQWvbLR29BVHL2EeTL1L9LE3T7uPwyQKtRdn7EouSqE", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["pet", "pixelart", "cat", "pixel", "animal", "objkt4objkt"], "extra": {}}
