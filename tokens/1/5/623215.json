TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO FIGHT THE FAR RIGHT, is work that speaks truth to many, many virtues in life; none more so than, cooperation. Hate should have no safe harbor in our hearts and minds. We can stand together and stamp out hate from the far-right. In whatever form it takes, there needs to be: patience, compassion, integrity, courage, trust, and wisdom to name a few. We need to be the healthy alternative to show what life outside of a hate filled cult is like; an open invitation to love again. Also, when I use the term fight, I don't mean literally fighting as that would be stooping down to their level of depravity; it's fighting using love. Love always wins; always in all ways.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX3KK1GuBieDMgwxQYJoeHUbTr24uiKGHhrTcNAkmcWho", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ2D2Vihy5DHtjACm74UuyTGhfYiuEb1UXftdtMudAQ9F", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX3KK1GuBieDMgwxQYJoeHUbTr24uiKGHhrTcNAkmcWho", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
