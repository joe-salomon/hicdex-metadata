The concept for the painting was to recreate a favorite pastime of relaxing and reflecting on a sandy beach while watching the foaming waves roll upon the seashore. The painting was created with acrylic paint pouring (or acrylic flow painting), a fluid painting technique where acrylic paints are mixed with a pouring medium and other additives. It was created by pouring liquefied paints into each other and then applying the mixture onto a stretched canvas using different pouring techniques. Hence, my first abstract fluid art painting via acrylic paint pouring. The animation was added to enhance the recreation of one's mindful reflections and relaxing experiences. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVWEhDeqE2sFifpgmgsPRYBahShMj5RqAx84UKiDqgKGv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZCwq2XsLoTTvJXPKSvHB6p2tuRtBqGdQXiVMvvLkXTX9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVWEhDeqE2sFifpgmgsPRYBahShMj5RqAx84UKiDqgKGv", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XQeAkWGur8esmmuChxBN5VTZk4X3Z48gH"], "tags": ["Acrylic", "Pouring", "fluid", "painting", "acrylic", "paint", "pourable", "Medium", "canvas", "abstract", "relaxing", "beach", "waves", "seashore"], "extra": {}}
