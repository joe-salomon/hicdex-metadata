Many of these practices have not been overcome today.\n\nI made this collage with some clippings from my early psychology books. It has been many, many years of a career that I have not practiced as someone who has an office and sees patients all morning. But that certainly made me sensitive to social injustice and the \"normalcy\" trap.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWp6ikjrBcv4Wk4ozTH6nP8JrWcMUjW4hQSoYqEiz5S1e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVAiJ4w8WUNHyFK5ws6u8Jwftta4Pw3DES918kKbbcyL5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWp6ikjrBcv4Wk4ozTH6nP8JrWcMUjW4hQSoYqEiz5S1e", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PCCyzHPujMqhh4aEbdDWvvzNf4KKzyGTw"], "tags": ["collage", "gifart", "stopmotion", "digitalcollage", ""], "extra": {}}
