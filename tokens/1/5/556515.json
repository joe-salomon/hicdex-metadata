Fear that the Church, supported by the State, consecrates and makes official. In defending itself, the dominant society also does so by propagating a religious fiction. And in such a way that this fiction, exacerbated, becomes a normalized madness. The religion of believers is thus a state of madness normalized by the material and ideological laws of the dominant classes. The greatest imbecilities are officially regarded as the deepest truths. What does this state of affairs express but that humans remain in a stage of creeping intellectual and therefore material slavery?\"\n- Mikhail Bakunin in \"God and the State\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaxKKdA5fE8strwFnEFXtdVLUUGV9m3rwZ6C83hApr7wK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRGGsuCLAzywpWm8fEeNBirTuFTxDkEpDAzCMYSUYf7Qv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaxKKdA5fE8strwFnEFXtdVLUUGV9m3rwZ6C83hApr7wK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gdao6M6VRVux8YGwHCUSzfFev8291qshj"], "tags": ["bakunin", "barricades", "painting", "digital", "history", "revolution", "labor", "rights"], "extra": {}}
