Now my worst nightmare begins.\nThere are eyes that sparkle, that look deep, study me, want to see my next movements. I can see her screams in the air, it's a creepy tune. I no longer know what to feel, what to think. I start to scream. I am not a carrion. She sees me tremble with fear that she causes me.\nMy supplies ran out, there is no sign of any rescue, I doubt my attempts to communicate on the radio will be heard. Damn my luck, falling on her and not letting me leave\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUtYuLYxgnwSMiQyH5amKJ3zyfpwCRWjhUuNBnauooUth", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaxwMXeg6pYbEuYMDmdrNj86XBC1GjhDr3ysBkoKdY8nv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUtYuLYxgnwSMiQyH5amKJ3zyfpwCRWjhUuNBnauooUth", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VZny7fs8eo78CZdGFT3EjqdogwZ4Pep3V"], "tags": ["story", "art", "nft", "HEN", "deeppurple", "deep", "landscape", "illustration", ""], "extra": {}}
