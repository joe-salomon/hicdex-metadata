We fall all the time, but as the old saying goes, \"Life is not about how many times you fall down. It's about how many times you get back up.\" We keep fighting and will never stop. By perfecting foot placement or experimenting with jumping patterns or however each skater learns, little by little we're fighting back gravity's grip on us. Battles are fought in the streets, the skateparks, the vert ramps, and on home driveways across the world. Though, when I first started in 1990, skateboarding almost died and went extinct because of a lack of interest, it was illegal in so many places, and parents looked down upon it. Fast forward to 2021, it's popularity has exploded beyond comprehension for us old timers. It's now an official Olympic Sport! We live in interesting times now and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this way of life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRZirjnw6kfofU4Kfa3K2d2TPjhgVsBT6x5xvgB4WkwuU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPSjAFPNtvd6ktiwmUzuNnNyvVA12zBXxS4BJRnr89b2R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRZirjnw6kfofU4Kfa3K2d2TPjhgVsBT6x5xvgB4WkwuU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
