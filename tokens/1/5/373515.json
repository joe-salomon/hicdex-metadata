It can be distinguished from the Sunda pangolin by its smaller scales and shorter head and body-to-tail length ratio. It is one of the most heavily poached and trafficked of the eight pangolin species. \n\nIn some beliefs, according to Martin Walsh,  He records that it was believed pangolins fell to Earth from the sky, sent by the spirits of the Sangus\u2019 ancestors. \u201cSome Africans make the pangolin the central emblem of healing people who have been unable to bear children.\u201d\n\nIt reminds us the pangolin serves as a symbol of hope that even the unhappiness of not being able to have children may be overcome.\n\nSource: https://www.pangolinsg.org/pangolins/philippine-pangolin/\nhttps://eia-international.org/blog/can-power-cultural-mythology-help-give-pangolins-ghost-chance/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT1aJiKWhAGoS7h51aKjyiZ3Wo5JGe7xNUJJ8CD1w2kHz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWFJShsY2EYdKtVcxpZv2WYawSisyBwPph5En7P3RWniE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT1aJiKWhAGoS7h51aKjyiZ3Wo5JGe7xNUJJ8CD1w2kHz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZzWbwteKmwRiwE3YNMa2JufN4q1wEUUdh"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "psychedelicart", "astral", "folklore", "animalart"], "extra": {}}
