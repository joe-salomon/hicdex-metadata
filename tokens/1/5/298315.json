Working iteratively from a single template of blocks Burtonwood sought to explore formal properties of hue, value and saturation. Each work is painted on 8.5 x 11 inch paper using acrylic gouache. They are being minted on HEN as 1/1 editions. A book of all the Color Studies together plus an essay by media theorist Patrick Lichty is available msg me on twitter for more info @tburtonwood\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihwi7ljy6zn6l7lkkc4jnxi65d5kc3js6cdar5t3qsbkmj5msbeha", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreihkpt3zcxsoksi2aeum5biih5j7jcd3mco6plhg2yhamtdb7l4574", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihwi7ljy6zn6l7lkkc4jnxi65d5kc3js6cdar5t3qsbkmj5msbeha", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QMRu8dCDNoAuGpMZRqBBBqW4zmyUq4wTS"], "tags": ["Painting", "gouache", "colorstudy", "repetition", "tetris", "tomburtonwood"], "extra": {}}
