A photo of the house where I grew up in Western Australia, decades after leaving the city and the house had been sold. The road home ends in a place which is virtually unrecognisable save for the basic bones of the structure.\n\nOriginal photography filtered through the lens of generative abstraction. Digital oil painted onto a noisy geometric canvas. 6000x6000.
