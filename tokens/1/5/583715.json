{"__version": 1, "token_id": 583715, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hades, King of the Underworld", "description": "\nA story about the world? Yes yes, we know one\" This is how the journey of the artists to show their vision about the Greek gods and their forms begin. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis is my Brazilian version of the god Hades, the Lord of the Underworld.  Coming from a psychedelic dimension this deity is the Lord of the dead.  This representation brings with it his Helm of Invisibility, a magical object forged especially for this god by the Cyclopes, and which grants its wearer incredible powers.  The three-headed dog Cerberus could not be left out of a psychedelic version of Olympian.  Anyway, a very fun representation of this God.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcMs5aFKFMewX5YjFNy6ehTh5nWxKUxSQ57fwuyevXPLd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeUqugtP4XFLCdShZyycrDLtWsEseYSFjroY14UCaoPjb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcMs5aFKFMewX5YjFNy6ehTh5nWxKUxSQ57fwuyevXPLd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SXenpKSBH8yBV8RJkQd7WM9zDHRrmqBzm"], "tags": ["Hades", "colorful", "diversity", "god", "mythology", "Olympians", "Cryptomigues", "deads", "brazilian", "brasil", "CryptOlimpianos"], "extra": {}}
