Boil 1 cup of rice in 2 cups of water. Place a veggie steamer basket or colander in the same pot you are cooking rice in, and add the roughly chopped sweet potatoes to it. Cover with a lid so the sweet potato steams while the rice is cooking. (***if you have already steamed you sweet potato, skip to step 6 where it says \u201cSweet Potato Roti Method\u201d)\n\n2. Prep all the veggies, and set aside.\n\n3. Add 2 Tbsp minced garlic, 1 /4 cup finely diced green onion, & 2 Tbsp plant based butter to a pan. Bring to a low simmer for ~ 3-5 min or until green onions are slightly browned.\n\n4. Add 1 can black beans to a sauce pot, then add the following ingredients, cover w/a lid & bring to a simmer over a low heat.  \n\n1 tsp cumin \n1 tsp oregano\n\u00bd tsp smoked paprika \n2 Tbsp (~\u00bd) lemon juice\nFresh ground salt (1/4 tsp) & pepper to taste\n\n5. Remove the green onion from the pan & put it into a heat safe mixing bowl.\n\n\nSweet Potato Roti Method:\n\n6. Add the sweet potatoes to the green onions (see step 3 above); as long as you can put a fork into a sweet potato piece & pull it back out with little to no effort. If the sweet potato is still not tender, continue to steam. (***Make sure to turn the heat off the rice once the water has completely evaporated or when rice is tender. Keep covered to retain the heat.)\n\n7. Using a fork, smash the sweet potato & incorporate the green onion mixture while doing so. \n\n8. Once the sweet potatoes are well smashed, add ~ \u00bc tsp fresh ground salt & pepper to taste + \u00bc cup all purpose flour at a time until the dough is firm enough to handle. It will still be a bit sticky, but make sure to keep your hands & working surface well floured rather than adding a ton of flour to make it easier to work w/or you will end up w/pizza crust instead of soft roti tacos because this dough gets tougher the more it is handled & the more flour it contains. Also be mindful not to overwork the dough. \n\n9. Once the dough can be formed, roll the dough into a cylinder shape by rubbing it between your two hands like you\u2019re making a snake out of playdough ;) and then separate the dough into 4 pieces. \n\n10. Work the dough into a tortilla shape and transfer to a hot pan (no oil is required).\n\n11. Heat on both sides for 2 min intervals until you have cooked each piece for about 5-7 min or until they bubble up like pillows or become golden brown. Transfer to a dish lined in towels so you can keep them warm until you are ready to use them. \n\n12. TIME TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER! inJOY!\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBlog post (1/26/2019): \nhttps://lemuria9.wixsite.com/website-1/post/sweet-potato-roti-tacos\n\nYouTube (1/5/2022):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksGFQNswpY8\n\nIG post (1/26/2019):\nTaco Filling ~> \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BtGwkHxA0jw/\n\nSweet Potato Roti Bread/Tacos Pt 1 (1/26/2019) ~> \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BtGy8f3AiB_/\n\nSweet Potato Roti Bread/Tacos Pt 2 (1/26/2019) ~> \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BtG1wkTg1sq/\n\nFinished product Pt 1 (1/26/2019) ~> \nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BtG2VQAg7Hg/\n\nFinished product Pt 2 (1/26/2019) ~>\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BtG4GVEgM2F/\n\nEating finished product (1/26/2019) ~>\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BtG475EgoYI/\n\n*******************************\n\nMinted 1/5/2022:\nMoon 27 deg Aquarius\nSun 15 deg Capricorn, Venus 20 deg retrograde in Capricorn, and Pluto 26 deg Capricorn sextile Neptune 20 Pisces\n\n-------------------------------\n\u00a9 2021 Recipe NFTs Inc. \nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nwww.recipeNFTs.com\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRdDgqLsk3ueaPbzhBM6thVgUHybo1TwVfSCnXgcAyzy2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRdDgqLsk3ueaPbzhBM6thVgUHybo1TwVfSCnXgcAyzy2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRdDgqLsk3ueaPbzhBM6thVgUHybo1TwVfSCnXgcAyzy2", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hU3XG444nNcSLZyoPwC6LeVndYnMYZML6"], "tags": ["sweetpotato", "roti", "rotibread", "rice", "blackbeans", "zucchini", "mushroom", "avocado", "cherrytomato", "tacos", "plantbased", "vegan", "orange", "food", "recipe", "recipeNFT", "recipeNFTs", "hen.recipes", ""], "extra": {}}
