South Africa. \n\n\u201cThe Quagga were reported to have gathered in herds of 30 to 50, sometimes traveling in a linear fashion over the arid Karoo plains.\u201d \n\n\nUsing steganography this JPEG has been encoded with the sequenced DNA of the Quagga. The image therefore hides the genetic code of the animal within. \n\n\n#ExtinctAnimals is a collection of pixelated fauna representing the last specimens of species that disappeared from earth. Bright pixels, fossil records and genetic descendants are all we have left. As an NFT, each of these images is unique, finite, and scarce -- much like the last extinct animals they depict.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfGxt4gZr3DipgzgAHAFPGeDTJEz37enrtZ2PHqDd8TBY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbT8huPhGpYHxRqxQWceV4r82GJh25G2gJQyqhBDme7u9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfGxt4gZr3DipgzgAHAFPGeDTJEz37enrtZ2PHqDd8TBY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NdE7FmyWQxLky7n2NpVaa2ioujTfqdigi"], "tags": ["extinctanimals", "pixelart", "dna", "steganography", "3d", "quagga"], "extra": {}}
