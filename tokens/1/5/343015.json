{"__version": 1, "token_id": 343015, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Plaosan Lor Temple", "description": "Experts claim that Plaosan Temple, a Buddhist shrine, was built during the era of Mataram Hindu Kingdom, when Rakai Pikatan was at the helm, at the dawn of the 9th century. De Casparis, one of the proponents of the claim, based his viewpoint on the inscription on Cri Kahulunan ancient stone (842 AD). The inscription stone states that Plaosan Lor Temple was built by Queen Sri Kahulunan, with the support from her husband. De Casparis argued further that Sri Kahulunan was a designation entitled to Pramodhawardani, the daughter of King Samarattungga of Syailendra Dynasty. The princess, a Buddhist, married Rakai Pikatan of Sanjaya Dynasty, who was a Hindu.\n\nOther experts argue that Plaosan Temple was built before Rakai Pikatan reigned. Anggraeni, a proponent of the claim, believed that Sri Kahulunan, instead of a princess, was Rakai Garung, the predecessor of Rakai Pikatan, who once ruled Mataram. The era of Rakai Pikatan was too short to build a temple as big as Plaosan. Rakai Pikatan, however, built the ancillary temple after the main temple was erected.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXXGSzEofHHtdPC9vuFwUmjsu6rVZ1knsW3fBjcqQWeAn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdJtRbtDtNihNi9hLUEDoYDNKp6hnp7JGQNyuGa2m6mHU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXXGSzEofHHtdPC9vuFwUmjsu6rVZ1knsW3fBjcqQWeAn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1doRvoMqj4HU9EysUHru7MffdCbkLpcUQt"], "tags": ["photography"], "extra": {}}
