I think it was recorded in 2008 or 2009 but I was working 60 hours a week at that point and it's fuzzy.\n\nThe visuals are combination of my main three techniques for video work: VQGAN+CLIP generated animation, TouchDesigner for noise, animation and compositing, and live video synthesis courtesy of a Raspberry Pi running Artificial Life. \n\nArtificial Life is Open Frameworks based, TouchDesigner is GLSL for it's shaders afaik.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQP2wgbNrkmKkDKS39HKqgirGrG12rdCQEzBFrq6gm4DY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbwPVwW6uhpTw2hjroAvokc6cLM5TiFzpviaeiP3F966n", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQP2wgbNrkmKkDKS39HKqgirGrG12rdCQEzBFrq6gm4DY", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LwHHzSP3oX4Lwpf2oPD52tViuxGCjCZQv"], "tags": ["music", "house", "techno", "hardware", "analog", "glitch", "abstract", "VQGAN+CLIP", "TouchDesigner"], "extra": {}}
