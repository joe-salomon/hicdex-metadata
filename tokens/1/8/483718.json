{"__version": 1, "token_id": 483718, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "GINGERBREADS", "description": "Similar to HEARTHSTONES, GINGERBREADS is a 12 lettered word that can be broken up into 2 separate words that are 6 letters each. Within each of these separate words we can add one letter to each line and create entirely new valid words (EADS is the only word, which is a proper noun; it's the last name of the American engineer & inventor James Buchanan Eads, famous for creating the world's first first steel arch bridge), which eventually connect to form GINGERBREADS. The shape or slope of the curves within the word is highlighted and accentuated by the use of the color orange and takes on almost a bridge type structure. Thanks Mr. Eads! Who knew that you were so meta within the English language?
