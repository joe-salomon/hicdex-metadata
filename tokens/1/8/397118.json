In the same way, this work is the result of a particular moment in time at my studio, where many unexpected things may happen patching several analog video synthesizers combined with 3D animations composed in processing. This piece is what I consider a \"true\" glitch, as the machines somehow trapped some feedback creating this mesmerizing effect. This instant cannot ever be repeated and should be appreciated as such. The central shape its sort of a seed flower that pulsates in a code-based animation. \nHardware:\nAmbery PIPV3\nKorg SQ-1 Step sequencer\n3TrinsRGB+1c\nJVC Video Editing Processor JX-SV55\nVideonics Video Equalizer VE-1\n\nSoftware:\nBlender3D\nProcessing 4\nOBS, VLC, Handbrake\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmboPkvC4Zore45STpsezABVP3QtFvoqrZbojDPJE4n6ZR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmboPkvC4Zore45STpsezABVP3QtFvoqrZbojDPJE4n6ZR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmboPkvC4Zore45STpsezABVP3QtFvoqrZbojDPJE4n6ZR", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1RdLkqan368BrBmQv8hNju72CVKpBF584f"], "tags": ["glitch", "analogvideo", "blender3d", "processing", "daily"], "extra": {}}
