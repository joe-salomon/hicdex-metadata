{"__version": 1, "token_id": 610418, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Chandraghanta, the third form of Durga ", "description": "\nIn Hinduism, Chandraghanta is the third form of Goddess Durga. Her name, Chandra-Ghanta, means \"one who has a half-moon shaped like a bell. Her third eye is always opened and she is always ready for war against demons\". She is also known as Chandrakhanda, Chandika or Rannchandi. Her worship takes place on the third day of Navaratri (the nine divine nights of Navadurga). She is believed to reward people with her grace, bravery and courage. By her grace, all the sins, distresses, physical sufferings, mental tribulations and ghostly hurdles of the devotees are eradicated. \n\nThis form of Devi Chandraghanta is a more war-ready and apparently aggressive form that goddess Durga takes; however, despite being adorned with the various weapons, she is also equally caring, benevolent and represents motherly qualities to her devotees. While the primary cause of this form was the destruction of demons, her rather fierce depiction brings with it the encouragement that praying to her can grant one fearlessness. She is otherwise the very embodiment of serenity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT5Z6jXEEE9Qzh6CpKGJhT6Rri3uBEGe6tAHZ1dHMWWw1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSSokpPHxZCM9obYxqusAefghdRvF8TiY2ogapPLxgmmQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT5Z6jXEEE9Qzh6CpKGJhT6Rri3uBEGe6tAHZ1dHMWWw1", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1iJ8RSnZx2DHWFrUrkSTrehGbtjU8paCqG"], "tags": ["Chandraghanta", "Durga", "hindu", "goddess", "mothergoddess", "wargoddess", "auraticart", "music", "digitalpainting", "digitalart", "glitch", "animation", "procreate", "Shiva", "Vishnu", "glitchanimation", "illustration", "figurative", "portrait", "tiger", "animal", "sacred", "divine"], "extra": {}}
