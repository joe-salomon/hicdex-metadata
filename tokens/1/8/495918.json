Take for instance, COMMADOES. All we did was add the \"E\" and immediately we have two separate words that are now together: Command & Does. If we investigate a little deeper we can find various words lurking. We can create a sentence like: AND DOES A MAN COMMAND? The overall main word reads like commandos, as in (A small fighting force specially trained for making quick destructive raids against enemy-held areas.). We could make the connection or inference with the sentence created to how the male dominated patriarchy of the world has cultivated men to be seen as uber-masculine and anything less is not considered \"manly\" enough. Imagine a world where men and women are seen as true equals? Let's teach our boys to be better men.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfLGMiV24syF1uUDh3vs1NpjTkh1n1Fk47zDRK7zdLhrs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNr1GWu9N7w77Jp7HD6LPCuvbcxed313yArpYtZ7iAL1e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfLGMiV24syF1uUDh3vs1NpjTkh1n1Fk47zDRK7zdLhrs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
