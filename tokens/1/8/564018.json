I visualize time as long black tremor lines, circles, ellipticals, or even distorted ellipsoid lines. Because time is dilated and everyone perceives time differently.\n\nYes, we, as humans, tend to perceive time differently. Some live in the future, and think a lot about tomorrow's plan. What to eat later in the day? What kind of work tomorrow?What to do next week?\u00a0What will become of us in the next 10 years?\n\nSome live in the past, and think about what's already happening over and over again in the head. Past lovers. Past joyous\u00a0moments. Past sadness. Anything that's been done and we couldn't change it.\u00a0\n\nBut we, as humans, tend to forget to be in the present. To live on this day, this hour, this second. To exhale all the oxygen that flew inside our lungs. To feel the chair that we sat on. To see the goodness that's laying in front of us. To be thankful for this day. To be in this moment.\n\n5000 x 5000 px\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmakkS954v9CHu9QjZkh9X64VQPHDUNHrrVTsBpFEtJsoS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRMHuu7vkimxrEJCX3JavVe7km2WCnVmRrSM45yyGiuRk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmc54oky2bwifH4iwXg4fdh511JBBzApH2oFq5o3pcQtba", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmakkS954v9CHu9QjZkh9X64VQPHDUNHrrVTsBpFEtJsoS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2VgKhJqbt8tpMSxZjKU38jD91m4Hi3VrnP"], "tags": ["time", "alidestroy", "artmoments", "metarupa", "nftprizedmoments", "abstract", "tremor", "lines", "expressionist"], "extra": {}}
