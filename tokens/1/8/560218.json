This piece is a gift to my collectors as a token of my appreciation for supporting me, as well as a celebration of my 22th birthday, November 29th. The photograph was taken 2 years ago in my hometown Townsville, Australia. The composition still amazes me till this day.\n\nIt's perfect for your phone's home-screen.
