The result is used to paint a color for this exact pixel. \n\nThe result is a huge collection of pseudo-fractal images which evoke impossible landscapes, crowded cities, glitchy psychedelic with vivid colors or just beautiful patterns. All of them are deterministic given its initial parameters.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPWb3Ug5CTyBVzHjWwHt1Vj5zBjsFMunJtPyxcgG8qdoe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXy32H6cHZu5gAcBp8neRAQyiQp8t4xAx36tHqMFomZNq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPWb3Ug5CTyBVzHjWwHt1Vj5zBjsFMunJtPyxcgG8qdoe", "mimeType": "video/webm"}], "creators": ["tz1SpToaU7V2HkUJ3KjJmRFx9k2XFAJH5Sc6"], "tags": ["fractal", "codeart", "math", "js", "genart", "abstract", "art", "algorithmic", "script", "generative", "colorful", "glitch", "creativecode", "unique", "video"], "extra": {}}
