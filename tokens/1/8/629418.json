This interactive NFT is the second in a series constructed from online debris left online over the past two decades, videos included the first 1,000 videos of searching for \"White House\" on Youtube. \n\nPre-YouTube, we built our knowledge base from C-Span and book reviews. With the establishment of YouTube 2005 to the present, we are presented with a growing number of opinions and viewpoints that eventually give rise to fake news.
