I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve found yourself looking down on buildings and cars from a plane window, or sitting atop a high vantage point watching tiny specs slowly moving down below. Each one of those specs has a life full of love, happiness, fear, anxiety, and worry. Many of us tend to get caught up in our own problems. They can feel so important and all-encompassing, however when observed from afar, seem to lose all significance. I like to picture what earth looks like in the night sky of our neighboring planets; yet a small blue dot. All of human history happened on that blue dot. It\u2019s such a beautiful reminder that everything is relative. Everything.
