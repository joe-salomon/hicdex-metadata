{"__version": 1, "token_id": 577918, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "HERE ALL WEAK HEAR ALL WEEK", "description": "HERE ALL WEAK / HEAR ALL WEEK, plays two sets of homophones (HERE/HEAR and WEAK/WEEK). You might have heard a comedian at some point blurt out during the tail end of a joke or their set say, \"I'm here all week\" or something similar. I forget which comedian I saw say this recently, but it stuck with me. Though, when I wrote it down I changed it up to mix up the narrative. The connotations of saying here all weak as opposed to here all week has completely different implications. Same thing goes for hear all week and hear all weak; totally different. Playing with homophones never gets tiring and/or old. You can create so many interesting and powerful puns that will either make your audience laugh or imbue jeers to your life. You decide. :D", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcdY6kUXhAaFCxGExJPAo937HxdHUyH3afZPmcKHibgHN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYiyGBgRvMhhgsAdNZ9An1MiR1ewzUhAakiuiYXdVs6xm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcdY6kUXhAaFCxGExJPAo937HxdHUyH3afZPmcKHibgHN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
