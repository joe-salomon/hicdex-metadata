Like, a lot. These 3 have always been my day-to-day survival kit to this day. But lately, I'm kinda sad because my friends who always accompany me to living this coffee-and-talk started to get hard to reach one-by-one.\n\nSome of them are married, have a new family, but some are just busy with their life. I don't know if i can keep living this kinda life or not, but right now, those are still my main method to living this harden life day by day.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQs7sUpodQrnHeBxKGHvTw8kHhvXasQmidLA9AfYQ3Cvc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeB6uEZGLh8VxP6nrQt2kHHwPSxEWiXRe1zreF2Zkm7BS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQs7sUpodQrnHeBxKGHvTw8kHhvXasQmidLA9AfYQ3Cvc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1W1HWbrTagjnXtwh1WQufdsdBvHdUY7NAQ"], "tags": ["art", "artwork", "abstract", "story", "heart", "mind", "soul", "coffee", "cigarette", "talk", "human", "overthinking"], "extra": {}}
