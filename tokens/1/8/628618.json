They need only water to survive, which makes their head bigger and grows their tentacle-like earings. To protect from storms or when they need sleep, they root themselves to the floor so they're less exposed. They are very social beings and use to comb one another with their beaks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUZ3ED2t4RJXPvxLpXh4aBE8CE9ecP6L1RtSA3RpCHr11", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPiAM1iQXDm57dj1B7JG2jFqn77YKQBskXkSiq64Ujdqy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUZ3ED2t4RJXPvxLpXh4aBE8CE9ecP6L1RtSA3RpCHr11", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ro3NdaGmfMq9jZNtMUQnWMmA1goKiXPSv"], "tags": ["darwin", "crypto", "tezos"], "extra": {}}
