New artists and new collectors are equal in trading and accessing to Art. It can be called that NFT is the new era of Art - the second renaissance!\n\nYou can notice that even this girl who has a robot friend is having a good time zipping wine, but her hand is tied with her phone for trading NFT all the time.\n\nShe also has a cat which is a symbol of rebirth and resurrection; per their nine lives. Cat has been with humans since ancient times and will always be with us through this Second Renaissance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcPDdk4zEiuLP2EgYEbCRvVqMhnME8xuPDJteVGPbGdn2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXe1iR6KC3SigWfWdMTKP6Mw7pSigZrPpQYx7TXa1ZrZW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcPDdk4zEiuLP2EgYEbCRvVqMhnME8xuPDJteVGPbGdn2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R8HRUAExMLHxHqoPpKt85Gy14ry3c2zTQ"], "tags": ["colorful", "fineart", "contemporaryart", "cryptoart", "painting", "popsurrealism", "art", "canvas", "acrylicartwork", "surreal", "nft", "crypto", "catpainting", "anime"], "extra": {}}
