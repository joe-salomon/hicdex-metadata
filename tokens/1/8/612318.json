{"__version": 1, "token_id": 612318, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Kampung Naga 1", "description": "Kampung Naga is a village inhabited by a group of people who are very strong in holding the customs of their ancestral heritage, in this case, the Sundanese business. Like the Bedouin settlements, Kampung Naga became the object of anthropological study of the life of the Sundanese rural people during the transition from Hindu influence to Islamic influence in West Java. There is no historical clarity, when and who the founders were, and what was behind the formation of this village with a still strong culture. The residents of Naga village themselves call the history of their town with the term \"Pareum Obor.\" The residents of Kampung Naga all claim to be Muslim. Teaching the Koran for children in Kampung Naga is held on Monday nights and Thursday nights, while the Koran for parents is held on Friday nights. In carrying out the fifth pillar of Islam or the Hajj, they think there is no need to go all the way to the Holy Land of Mecca, but it is enough to carry out the Hajat Sasih ceremony, which coincides with the Hajj Day, which is every 10th Rayagung (Dzulhijjah). The Hajat Sasih ceremony, according to the belief of the people of Kampung Naga, is the same as Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaYX59kVkpotqpQ2KnvgeRpptRW41r1VzB98SEh1Er54L", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSh19Lhj1FzEvJ4JzCT9TpJuj32B4gFCVaDoH33KbNzH1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaYX59kVkpotqpQ2KnvgeRpptRW41r1VzB98SEh1Er54L", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DXDS3piK3ucRxJS25j9j3Pu6fXcU8oWy5"], "tags": ["#photography"], "extra": {}}
