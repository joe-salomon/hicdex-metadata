The image frames in the video show the evolution of conceptuality.\nThe resulting work is an interpretation how artificial intelligence might see our world: colorful, shimmering and slightly psychedelic.\nThe artwork is unique and not repeatable, because chance plays a part and every algorithm run produces a different artifact.\n\nThe resolution of the video is 1080 by 1080 pixel.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPdzZxHpfdUQKFckPm7s6Ax77icpSijhe5p8W2JxRkd1h", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc4st8df5yN7TieLgoStahRxBghZttB2a1z3KAvERGaYR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPdzZxHpfdUQKFckPm7s6Ax77icpSijhe5p8W2JxRkd1h", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eF9WKnh69yVWTNF89RRG4Y93rLtmcFJEP"], "tags": ["machinelearning", "artificalintelligence", "psychedelic", "dream", "video", "digitalart", "lightbeam", "goldfish"], "extra": {}}
