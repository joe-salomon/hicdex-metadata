This interactive NFT is the second in a series constructed from online debris left online over the past two decades, videos included the first 1,000 videos of searching for \"White House\" on Youtube. \n\nPre-YouTube, we built our knowledge base from C-Span and book reviews. With the establishment of YouTube 2005 to the present, we are presented with a growing number of opinions and viewpoints that eventually give rise to fake news. The ebb and flow of political amnesia and nostalgia work together to fill in our cultural understanding of this icon.\n\nInteractivity uses Web.gl, which may need a moment to load.
