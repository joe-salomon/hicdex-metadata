Didion was an American writer who launched her career in the 1960s after winning an essay contest sponsored by Vogue magazine. Her writing during the 1960s through the late 1970s engaged audiences in the realities of the counterculture of the '60s and the Hollywood lifestyle. Her political writing often concentrated on the subtext of political and social rhetoric. In 1991, she wrote the earliest mainstream media article to suggest the Central Park Five had been wrongfully convicted. In 2005, she won the National Book Award for Nonfiction and was a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Biography/Autobiography for The Year of Magical Thinking. She later adapted the book into a play, which premiered on Broadway in 2007. \n\nProfits from the sale of this portrait will support Do Good Shit (dogoodshit.org) via The Giving Block (thegivingblock.com)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbujmT6Akn3YfDouk9t39FP2raHYbiQjVqfPjSpPT1d38", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTPMGm5oSS3R4jwXPZTReXp1dNg7tTRvneUmQ8Ws5wrWb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbujmT6Akn3YfDouk9t39FP2raHYbiQjVqfPjSpPT1d38", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2GLPS9uG28oiiqV6WJVw4ABk3hrEKa4dF9"], "tags": ["JoanDidion", "portrait", "rip", "quilt"], "extra": {}}
