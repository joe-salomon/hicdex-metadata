And I feel embarrassed because I'm supposed to feel love and good things after all this time. Then, I understood that anger is not a bad or a good feeling, is just an emotion. Emotions are necessary to do things. Feelings are neutral. And I need the anger and the darkness to met the love and happiness.\n\nI always feel too much. I am intense. And I want to show you in a self-portrait. I want to express my feelings, I want to show the universe inside me through photography.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZf7XW11zja9fMJnnFMceDoRWQAbuLQG1cLp48FkayLMJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR8EWrsv5gJqrp8tAaDLCTX5MA95oUPTHkpU9DS9sQLP4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZf7XW11zja9fMJnnFMceDoRWQAbuLQG1cLp48FkayLMJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QeQDHicCFxnvBzeTewdaKqKRfU2VCHHGn"], "tags": ["nftartphototeznftphotographynftcreatornft"], "extra": {}}
