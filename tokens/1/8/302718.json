I looked over at the stop light and saw you sitting in the passenger seat of your new boyfriends car. You looked right at me, but didn\u2019t see me. Thanks in part to the unnecessary degree my windows are tinted. Mostly because you never really liked looking at me.\nI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to, promised even, but I followed behind you two for a moment and pulled into the same grocery store parking lot. \nI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to, even promised, but I went in. \nI hovered one aisle over letting my eyes go out of focus staring at the frozen pizzas while you two discussed dinner plans and a trip you were taking soon. \nI told myself I wasn\u2019t going to, I promised, but I walked down the same aisle as you. I Said \u201cexcuse me\u201d as I reached over your shoulder for detergent. You apologized for being in my way, so unlike you. \nYou didn\u2019t recognize me, how could you? This isn\u2019t even my face, my body...\nAnyway, I picked up a new brand of granola I really like that day. We\u2019ve all been through this.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihvnuipqdpsckhqcfrfsqj477sowqeo2rmhwfeuyoyf4unalz4zgy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibbbb4ldafr2abcy2egmkmmcodw6rjg2zr2vdzo6ae2ngwrkfzlhy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihvnuipqdpsckhqcfrfsqj477sowqeo2rmhwfeuyoyf4unalz4zgy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KsJersUKgmTEXzPLJMHkq3JWUoBA9ZpA7"], "tags": ["pnw", "clouds", "roads", "oregon", "oreconcoast", "landscape", "photography", ""], "extra": {}}
