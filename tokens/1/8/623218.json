Can you see the real you? Can your ego for a moment see past itself? Can you see past all of it? Can you see that you're on borrowed time? Can you see that every moment that you're peering into that mirror is another moment you can't get back? Can you see your fear? Your fear of dying? It's there...it's in all of us. Life doesn't owe us anything, we just are. That being said, death owes us because we're alive. (Thanks for the pick me up Andrew. You must be wonderful at church cupcake sales events.)
