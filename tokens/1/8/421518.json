The youngest child loves to play with water, transfers it from different bottles to glasses, and vice versa, likes to drink this water and spit it out.\n\nI think a lot about what self-isolation gives me. On the one hand, this is a lot of quiet time when I can do something constructive. On the other hand, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have learned very little about the world, and fears have arisen from this. I am haunted by fears of unexpected events in the outside world, accidents, for example. I have not flown by plane for a year and 9 months, and it is difficult for me to imagine how I will do it again and travel. What once gave rise to a zest for life now evokes irrational fear.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSYZRS5kc2W6x47BvxCBwkWdj5bAVex3FQpdzehK8StbH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUxmsmhQ5cEUpSSqMA4vQQ2vk3xQ2ZMsEJwKnaQGMAYAi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSYZRS5kc2W6x47BvxCBwkWdj5bAVex3FQpdzehK8StbH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d5HE9dWCn6ciiSgLRvfegDiHyMUt6oo4w"], "tags": ["polaroiddiary", "polaroid", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
