We grew up in the 90s, with a Tetris in our hands. We raised a flock of tamagotchis and learned a million ways on how to blow a bubble from Love Is cherry gum. What I want to say is that even though we are grown-ups, we will always be kids, and this is totally dope!\n\nLetter A in my Kidult Alphabet is for Artistic state of mind. Because we are super artistic in every sphere of our life. Fancy slippers are no waste of money, they are an investment in our lifestyle!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfMntmmG4hEHzeTEAr9SkNvACHnYRp2dhSZhVsD3QrXeG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWyJAzVq9MqZcCdPcs4GXpRiuLjELpRNjQSWAxzTYhJin", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfMntmmG4hEHzeTEAr9SkNvACHnYRp2dhSZhVsD3QrXeG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LA28RxLyzg4iV9jxDLrmzgC6WwCHT2fMZ"], "tags": ["illustration", "fun", "slipper", "digital", "typography", "sound", "animation", "2d", "kidult", "nostalgia", "characterdesign", "digitalillustration", "digitalart", "lettera", "letter", "typea", "funny", "artistic", "stripes", "foot", "leg", "kidultalphabet"], "extra": {}}
