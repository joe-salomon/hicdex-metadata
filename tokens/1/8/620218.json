But this one, make a Venn diagram about a pun on the word Venn and then add every that could possibly be connected to that word into that Venn diagram. Inception level pun event going on right here. This was definitely one of the more difficult works of this series for sure. Not many words can be broken down like this, but when it does happen...it's like looking at polished rare ruby or sapphire. I hope you enjoy it as much as I had making it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNhEXevWveBDFKApzAucrCpTquJQb11CChyZkHeufee9E", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaZPSeFZcRBQoZZ5USSWypAWJRXH3CYKbmMgvLUVDnfGg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNhEXevWveBDFKApzAucrCpTquJQb11CChyZkHeufee9E", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
