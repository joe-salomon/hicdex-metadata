This is a view that is not only unseeable by average photographers due to the elevation, but it is taken from the side of a covered bridge known as the Gallon House Bridge. Named from the remnants of the prohibition era, moonshine and other contraband were sold and exchanged near the Gallon House Bridge, located on a country road just outside of Mount Angel and Silverton, Oregon. Fitting, then, that a couple was sitting in their car smoking marijuana. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma2oqgqcCZfgdBtdcRz8KGn4ZWiboT3pmAUuWGqAhLB1e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWLXgqo56mtShTMcSSqaYsTk7be7UCCEApWbyUke1TgiC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma2oqgqcCZfgdBtdcRz8KGn4ZWiboT3pmAUuWGqAhLB1e", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["sunset", "painting", "digitalart", "gallon", "nature", "outdoors"], "extra": {}}
