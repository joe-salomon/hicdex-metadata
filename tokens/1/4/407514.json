{"__version": 1, "token_id": 407514, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "YOUTH & EYES / YOUTH IN ASIA", "description": "What is it about sound and reading language that cause us to think about certain words in certain ways? When we read and hear certain words that are either homophones, homonyms, homographs, heteronyms, heterographs, and/or other forms of linguistic sounds, our eyes and ears play tricks on us. The English language can make roughly 15,831 various types of syllables, that's a lot of combinations. It's absolutely mindblowing to think of all the possibilities of all the combinations there within. This is just one example of how two words; EUTHANIZE & EUTHANASIA can be read 3 different ways each, producing 6 separate outcomes altogether. The English language is littered with these things, in fact there are approximately 88 triples; 24 quadruples; 2 quintuples; 1 sextet, 1 septet, and 1 octet. No other language is able to do this, as far as I've seen.
