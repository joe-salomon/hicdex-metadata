{"__version": 1, "token_id": 412214, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Homage to Schiele (version II)", "description": "This digital artwork is inspired by a painting by the Austrian painter Egon Schiele. I saw it in a book many years ago when I was in Brazil, I bought this book for pennies in a street market and at that moment I have never seen his work before. \n\nThis particular digital painting is inspired by an acrylic painting that I made back in 2014 and it is currently part of a private collection. I started reading a bit about his life and works, and often Egon painted prostitutes and this is very close to my heart and interesting to me. \n\nTo imagine that a man could have the tenderness and self-awareness to portrait women that were/are ostracized in society and turning them into muses it is beyond words to me. \n\nI have now lost this book and I can't remember the particular painting I used as inspiration to produce this piece. If this rings a bell to anyone, please let me know. I would love to see her again.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTSXVkmk9etsBNfQqUNoksx4wiHUHhscWq8c1bjYuaQ7k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQtifb4GdynxrcHjdk5nsg1oesSeJbfpXRUJjbpu8jaqE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTSXVkmk9etsBNfQqUNoksx4wiHUHhscWq8c1bjYuaQ7k", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eoHcb3MpXZ9uJMZwQpAQ1wfmzAWuiGSSP"], "tags": ["brazilianartist", "austria", "collectable", "colorful", "nudity", "psychodelic", "colorido"], "extra": {}}
