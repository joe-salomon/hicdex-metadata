But now they are the symbol of environmental destruction. Like a relic from the past that people don't want to deal with. \n\nThis is another approach to draw the motif of a miner again and again. A motif from the coal age, I illustrated in a more traditional way. I celebrate the heavy reproducibility of the handwork with the help of the GIF's timeline. With a steady waft of the drawn figure in the loop, it emphasizes the beauty of the handmade. \n\nThis series, is meant to be a homage to the old way of mining and feeding the fundaments of our society. We all know who took their place to feed the fundaments of our brave new crypto society.
