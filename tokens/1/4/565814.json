The antithesis of the Collector\u2019s Zoetrope, the Mass Market Zoetrope prides itself on being simple, inexpensive, and replicable. It was designed with two functions in mind: 1. To afford the user an exhilarating zoetrope experience in the most succinct manner possible, and 2. To make the Collector\u2019s Zoetrope appear more luxurious by comparison. Everyone has access to the Mass Market Zoetrope. The 3D files have been made available for free, under the CC0 Public Domain license, so that you can 3D print one for yourself. This limited gold edition was created to be given away as a gift. https://www.dropbox.com/s/kdcvi7fuvdoml2r/MassMarketZoetrope_STL.zip?dl=1\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXCWCRuQvMkQvVWdxfDPpDSZhdnSSmFtrEakgPw5EnQ8s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZE7LAyyWWMXUAaJX77HSkkLe3gSUyYbjM7LaA3buxuFe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXCWCRuQvMkQvVWdxfDPpDSZhdnSSmFtrEakgPw5EnQ8s", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WeHGma2Jzwoejq9DaXLCE7R5UyRp5LV8g"], "tags": ["digital", "3dprint", "zoetrope", "animation", "penguins", "art", "sculpture"], "extra": {}}
