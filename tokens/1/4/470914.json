All the works will be 1/1.\n\nThis piece of the collection is one of my favorites and also one of the most emotional at the time of creating it, the image of the airplanes is from a bombing that made the same Argentine Navy to the Plaza De Mayo on June 16, 1955 with the aim of overthrowing Juan Domingo Peron and establish a coup, democratically elected president by the Argentine people. The massacre left 300 dead and hundreds of people wounded, a very sad fact that happened in my country.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf347mtYsQAxoJfai7H5aiAaVi4mPbsSgUvhB5zJXkGcN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRAZTERPZfjUE82g6HPrYMFykqr8eMYpghYEZ3Vpie5CV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf347mtYsQAxoJfai7H5aiAaVi4mPbsSgUvhB5zJXkGcN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fyWsXPcvWwaLcp8T2AyycSyNd7yHaxNZd"], "tags": ["nfts", "photography", "collage", "analog", "surrealism", "aesthetic", "artwork", "photomanipulation", "digitalart", "manual", "nft", "trippy"], "extra": {}}
