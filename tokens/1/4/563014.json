This is similar to an peak experience I had at 5 a.m, where I felt a moment of oneness. Where are everything fell into place and where are dreams were obtainable.\nEver since that moment it had been my journey to explore what that feeling was via the arts. \n\nThis piece of art contains music that creates about that experience and the feeling of infinite possibilities. \nI want share and inspire and be an anthem for the people wanting to start each GM with energy, gusto sunshine and that life on this day go perfectly as they they imagine it to be.
