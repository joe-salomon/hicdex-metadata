We took this in a pool at his friend's mansion. The photos we took were truly phenomenal. Love working with Shayne. I feel as though he is very comfortable with himself and his identity that he really gives this abstract energy in all of his photos. The water with the hands on his face give such mixed feelings to viewers. I composed the photo this way on purpose. I wanted the viewer to feel that they were in the water with him as the angle is so close to the water. ---The Young Abstract", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSxBicMvyAV4ynHVBfRw4f1oEQyFnrStcMia4VJSPRua3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUv1YM21pbZ6ECxk1cCtmgQLRGA2LHwMLmKKvqSdDZf8B", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSxBicMvyAV4ynHVBfRw4f1oEQyFnrStcMia4VJSPRua3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Led6YHRwk7vtkEk947otjJyAh5fYdkHMy"], "tags": ["Photography", "TheYoungAbstract", "YoungAbstract", "Abstract", "NFTPhotography"], "extra": {}}
