On this day, also played the bands C\u00e4br\u00e4negr\u00e4, B\u00f6riz Kas\u00f6\u00f6y and the noise artist Bukabog. A loud night for everyone.\nThis event took place at \"Casinha\", one of the main venues for underground artists in the city of Curitiba, Brazil. Unfortunately, the space had to shut down and be unoccupied due to imobiliary speculation in the region.\nBesides a sentimental value for the day, this art piece is a way to remember that place where I already played a few times and where I watched so many other shows.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPdfQbjm5GeDfGnszve1PHyKWC1ngcNqeMUfhiKzBUWRV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQmmMFJSYQKaH6hHjxJRkxe5gViG8qzTe2yXUtju2QJRj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPdfQbjm5GeDfGnszve1PHyKWC1ngcNqeMUfhiKzBUWRV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RsFrbkJync4shc9ZxfjG4DMLXBDRbLXt9"], "tags": ["poster", "punk", "collage", "analogcollage", "casinha", "ruidomorto", "cartaz", "memoria", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
