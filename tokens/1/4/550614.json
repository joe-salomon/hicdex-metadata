The forms on each side arise through bleed-through of different analog media, and then finer work is performed in multiple iterations on each side. While they resemble each other and share essntial qualities of color and form, each side follows own trajectory. \n\nWhat is a distance of a single piece of paper? A millimeter? A bullet that missed? A letter that was or was not written? A masterpiece? A testament? A story? An agreement? A constitution? An apology? Or just a sketch? A distance of one piece of paper can measure thousands of papers. That distance can be almost infinite.
