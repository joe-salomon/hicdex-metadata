These time series gifs are to their greatest irony immutably saved on the blockchain. The work intends to visualize the ongoing process of ocean acidification. As the acid slowly dissolves the shells, carbon is released, and the gas formation makes the shells jump, creating a dynamic picture. The alkalinity of the shells is slowly neutralizing the acid, indicated by the change of colour. The greater underlying meaning of this work, and in general of auto-destructive art, is to question our obsession with ownership, mortality and letting go.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbdFFDgvkYzR6ZzYqKKiYBtyG2bavu36JKhoQ8mp964L2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdFFDgvkYzR6ZzYqKKiYBtyG2bavu36JKhoQ8mp964L2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbdFFDgvkYzR6ZzYqKKiYBtyG2bavu36JKhoQ8mp964L2", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1MdQy4d7e7ecd4Zg92STehgktEBEbeQTsC"], "tags": ["monkey", "box", "acid", "autodestructive", "destructive", "natural", "generative", "ocean", "acidification", "shells", "Metzger", "process", "possession", ""], "extra": {}}
