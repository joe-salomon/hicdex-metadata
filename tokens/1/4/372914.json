All five photos were taken on a Pentax K10D.\n\nAt over 2,653m above sea level, the Weisshorn is the highest peak in the Arosa region that can be reached by cable car. From where this panorama was taken, there are breathtaking views of more than 400 mountain peaks in Switzerland and neighbouring countries to enjoy. \n\nArosa is a town and a municipality in the Plessur Region in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden in Switzerland. It is both a summer and a winter tourist resort and has received major boosts in popularity in the past due to famous fans including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\nThis is my first Creative Commons 0 Licence NFT.
