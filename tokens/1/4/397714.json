I took this image with a Canon 5d IV converted to allow the full spectrum of light to pass through to the image sensor. I narrowed the bandwidth of light recorded by the image sensor by placing an \u201cIR Chrome\u201d filter in front of the lens. This filter allows both visible and infrared wavelengths to pass, and was engineered to achieve the look of Kodak Aerochrome IR film, straight out of camera, with no editing required. The resulting image is what you see here, where green trees turn red and visible blues are retained. The full spectrum conversion and \u201cIR Chrome\u201d filter are products of KolariVision.com\n\n29.9 mpx, 6697 x 4465 px (24 x 16\u201d @ 280 ppi)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY3YfYo4G1MM3WgPzeLKqNgjJuLSQgNKW9kjzfjtfVhDb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTMcLWoURPCVg4NqQtgJzDmP7gS2xLxa9Wrp8roLzSpgk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY3YfYo4G1MM3WgPzeLKqNgjJuLSQgNKW9kjzfjtfVhDb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SDpUuU72YwaFo2FXwcU93VdwrBz876B9N"], "tags": ["photography", "digitalphotography", "mountains", "lake", "infrared", "infraredphotography"], "extra": {}}
