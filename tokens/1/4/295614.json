Get ready to be gaslit by gaslight in a mesmerizing story scripted by Laura Marks, a comics newbie and TV veteran. I met Laura working on the never aired version of Locke & Key prepped by Hulu and was blown away by her deft touch at dialogue and go for the throat instinct. And how about this skin-crawling first cover from Piotr Jablonski? So looking forward to this one.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibhe6zf75l2q5pdh3xcfd5yufgqw4f3txndgf5phbwi536ra6xq3a", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiexcry7jis3auhhgdz2o6caztl477mfdinxe36atypihmxyy3skvi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreibhe6zf75l2q5pdh3xcfd5yufgqw4f3txndgf5phbwi536ra6xq3a", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1czoKZCFp3qGkYH3d3gSQRoCgJZD6Ee3Ju"], "tags": ["illustration", "art", "painting", "drawing", "design"], "extra": {}}
