I jotted a note about it in my journal and went about my day. That evening, my husband asked me a random question about bananas, and then the funny movie we watched had several references to bananas, and THEN an unrelated article I read mentioned a banana!\n\nOkay, God, I get it. It\u2019s time to publicly tell \u2026 THE BANANA STORY.\n\n(My apologies to those who have heard it before, but there's a whole crop of people who haven't, so, to those who haven't heard the story \u2014 this one's for you!)\n\nOne afternoon, I was studying the Bible. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I was studying in the Bible but I know during that time, I was doing word studies on fruits of the Spirit (a group that actually does NOT include bananas!), so it was probably something related to that. I would look up places in the Bible where that fruit of the Spirit or attribute of God was mentioned and meditate upon it.\n\nMidway through my Bible time, I wanted a banana.\n\nI took note of the time. I didn\u2019t have very long before I needed to go pick up my mom from work. So, I could either go to the kitchen and eat a banana, or I could stay in our home office room and keep studying the Bible.\n\nI chose the latter.\n\nWhen I picked up my mom and she got in the car, she did something that she had never done before and has never done since. It was a moment I will never forget. \n\nShe reached in her black purse, pulled out a banana and said, \u201cWould you like a banana?\u201d\n\nWhoa.\n\nIt was one of those moments when you\u2019re like, \u201cIs this really happening!?\u201d I knew it was from the Lord.\n\nYou see, when we give up something of the world to pursue Him, He will always give it back to us \u2014 either in the same form (a banana just like the ones we have at home!) or in a different way or as a different thing that\u2019s even better.\n\n\u201cSo do not worry, saying, \u2018What shall I eat?\u2019 (or \u2014 \u2018But what about the fact that I want a banana?\u2019) \u2026 For your Heavenly Father knows what you need. Seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d*\n\nEven bananas.\n\n-\n\n*Matthew 6:33", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNY7aqVCujqjspp7RwgNLP9hzF3ypFhv7PBvXGfNidmkJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbtG7Rfu38Qhmj8JujLuT1xS66LZqvKKx2k9UDYavajYR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNY7aqVCujqjspp7RwgNLP9hzF3ypFhv7PBvXGfNidmkJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2KBU4Z6jBeEB3boa53GqKjtQy3k9ANcnB2"], "tags": ["banana", "testimony", "portrait", "waves", "ocean", "yellow", "lightpinknails", "girl", "youngwoman", "womanofGod", "truestory", "story", "reallife", "happy", "smile", "joy", "joycomesfromtheLord"], "extra": {}}
