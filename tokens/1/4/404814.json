It is as if they are being zoomed in  It is as if they are control samples  In the next stage, I realized that the aesthetic inside them is not enough, so I decided to bring in a new kind of aesthetic  I poured their surrounding nature, which was working properly as context for the figures\u2019 initial conditions, into them and I even gave them ideas! I even changed the material of technical approach and led the technical part to a direction that I wanted What we eventually see is only reminiscent of Persian painting, and they are even more seductive and apparently self-contained But they are in fact new subjects emptied of their essence  Lost and bewildered, they live in white contexts on the walls to which they do not belong  This show is aimed at capturing the essence of art in a paradoxical manner in order to establish a dialogue between the aesthetics of art and potential emancipation latent in politics and to admit standing within the circle of power while keeping possibilities for emancipation in perspective  \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYLSZHmVrVQrTzMfHeUvDgbbeNWmjTZY2nMsPgF6Nts1n", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYsqHxpoQdNwKAdLTaw9x2YgfNr825pQHzGtrr4dYrvna", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYLSZHmVrVQrTzMfHeUvDgbbeNWmjTZY2nMsPgF6Nts1n", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iZ1FhYZP2fTxb2g9YSpjygQNLTqs3e4ra"], "tags": ["nft-horse-politics-visualarts"], "extra": {}}
