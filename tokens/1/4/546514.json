The artist represented the ideal of what an independent American woman at the turn of the 20th century should be/act/look like. \n\nI was particularly interested in Gibson's work at the time, as I was starting to really understand further Feminist theories and Gender politics within my life and also the world. \u2060\n\nDana represented an assertive ideal of women that demonstrated a certain conflict with the existing sexual hierarchies and gender roles at that time. \n\nHowever, despite Gibson's 'attempt to elevate the women's image in society, the conversation was again approached in a conservative and limiting way, and still via the male gaze.\u2060\n\nAt the same time, I was reading a book called The Bed in the Balcony by the Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer, Regina Navarro Lins. \n\nThis book was on the biggest success of the 90s, as is discussed in a revolutionary manner, the human sexual history, the empowerment of women in the Antiquity to the rise of patriarchy and new social norms.
