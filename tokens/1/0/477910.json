You never know how your life might veer depending on what you might encounter day to day. I lived in NY, moved to Atlanta for Portfolio School in 2004 and earned an internship BACK in NYC and while I was there was dragged to a show at the Kidrobot store. All of those series of events led me to designer toys and here I am 17 years later.
