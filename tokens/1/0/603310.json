It is definitely beyond the mind which creates Infinite experiences of change, which come and go. Reality is not an event, it cannot be experienced. It is not perceivable in the same way as an event is perceivable. In the Infinite ocean of Pure Awareness, on the surface of this Universal Ocean, waves seem to be numberless, arising and subsiding without a Beginning and Ending. Created the sounds using generative processing and explorations. Have always loved exploring soundscapes and this comes as a beautiful way of sharing alongside my visual Journey.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ8mnX5fU11gYAQboRu29VxPSM4ZfhGnDdW75hQnb7CjD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaaExWYFcvRhFAdWYSmHMVYFTgYCryTDyxDr7U6xgqwaP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ8mnX5fU11gYAQboRu29VxPSM4ZfhGnDdW75hQnb7CjD", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LRUSjbsKaNkKVUfjxRCNHY31Zezva8UgZ"], "tags": ["abstract", "animation", "beauty", "color", "eyes", "flow", "glitch", "illustration", "love", "nature", "portrait", "rare", "surreal", "surrealism", "texture", "vivid", ""], "extra": {}}
