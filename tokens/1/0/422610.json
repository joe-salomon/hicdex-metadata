Depending on how you listen you could hear either one. For the most part you would normally hear the top line, \"HELD ACCOUNTABLE\". That seems like something you'd hear at some point in your life, but what if someone said the second line? HELD A CANNIBAL? It's a bizarre thing to say in the least and creepy as hell to say in an actual conversation. I mean, who the heck wants to hold a cannibal? Uhhhh not THIS guy. Silliness aside, the way we say things can be interpreted in various ways depending on our life experiences, what culture we're from, what language we speak, etc. Ultimately, words have meaning and so does intonation. The combination of the two create almost an emotional context that we can interpret and respond to.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXd2Q3Q7pKwJ2R8LzKWYeQkoAH9CTzUwxPo3iv3nQ5LXK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVicBRQSDVkktgQfURmtMVpudp7GA7EYEHppcwPGuTWtb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXd2Q3Q7pKwJ2R8LzKWYeQkoAH9CTzUwxPo3iv3nQ5LXK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
