I see myself as the tiger\nthat its been abducted by those images. \n~~\nfor this gif, the idea was to evocate a narrative by animating the\nparts of the screen. it's an idea to not only show the work, but\nto create with it either. \non my instagram theres a video version with\nthe song\ncomputer love - kraftwerk. \n\ngif series\n3/10 \n\nnft 1-1. \n\n~~~~~\nBy collecting this, i will send you the real screen.\nAs i am in Brasil, maybe it will take a little long depends where you are. Its gonna be a pleasure to combine the ship with you. \n~~", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYGnFhHj3MBmprMfxgbEYqs5TMq8iu73fvPecaEAai6cA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYGnFhHj3MBmprMfxgbEYqs5TMq8iu73fvPecaEAai6cA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYGnFhHj3MBmprMfxgbEYqs5TMq8iu73fvPecaEAai6cA", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WVExoC3K2HWqVFdJqSXFibT2SB9ibZnsB"], "tags": ["T"], "extra": {}}
