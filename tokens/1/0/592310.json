Let this be a formal invitation to all the Tezzardz-holders around the globe. Hereby you are formally invited to our humble project. \n\nWhen the French decided to chop off the middle fingers of the British, in the hope of stopping these magnificent arrow shooters from killing them, they assumed they would never get shot again; well, you know that the middle finger is the most outstanding finger to shoot arrows. To their surprise, the British turn out to be victorious; then they erect the middle finger to show the French their source of power. That is exactly what the middle finger represents to us. Love, Peace, Not giving up; being hopeful, and also mastering the art of not giving a fuck!\u00a0 \n\nWe have come up with 5000 ways of expressing peace, spreading love, and showing brotherhood by giving the humanity the most astounding bird.\n\nwww.tezfingers.xyz", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfNFucH83CDYzDJHnY7jcYGdDPGWCTMkm5SwK6vNRQUJB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbapeJgJ6i8Wp5jnBbXJGajQ6Ro8DRGPoWhqvk3kgUjG7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfNFucH83CDYzDJHnY7jcYGdDPGWCTMkm5SwK6vNRQUJB", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1XXCsZnEhWQdNvbXwfyT1cmMU8nahrkJCT"], "tags": ["tezzardz", "tezfingers", "tribute", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}
