It doesn't work anymore, but I still have this phone as a keepsake of a new chapter in my life, a connection to family and friends. If you find an edition of this NFT in your collection, it means we may have a connection. This connection may grow, and holding onto this edition may provide an answer to that. You may also donate or sell this edition.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYVzHQBxM7PA2xFEvK3PLtKHZGDFGhdsd2GMVwoUvXvWN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYVzHQBxM7PA2xFEvK3PLtKHZGDFGhdsd2GMVwoUvXvWN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYVzHQBxM7PA2xFEvK3PLtKHZGDFGhdsd2GMVwoUvXvWN", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1R4bLnuw5uwWLrvFV3vajbw2eBXb6MQ3F3"], "tags": ["NICOLASSASSOON"], "extra": {}}
