For me panties and lingeries are usually something aggressively binary and sexist. So at the beginning of my brand as a black latin transfeminine body that is oppressed by those structures literally don\u2019t fitting on them I wanted to use it as a token to talk about body empowerment, body positivity and also make fun of it. Therefore I created six allegorical panties that represent everything that I could never express, all those repressed feelings expressed as panties. In that day we generate a paties party atmosphere as a celebration and fellowship of our expressions and bodies as queer latin folks and recorded with a handcam. This work represents to me the first step as a single creative director of my own brand and also the importance that doing things collectively with people that I love and care has to me.\n\nTEAM *(`\uff65\u03c9\uff65\u00b4)*\n\nmodels: Gabrielle Gambine, Diana Jesus, Patrick Prodigy Blindex, Uyara Marina, Alysson Blindex, Pedra\nvideo edit/production: Atenna Stella Bovo \ndesign: Joyce Kiesel\nmakeup: G\u00fcta Helena \nsoundtrack: Pujol \ndirection: Pedra \nspecial thanks: Anddy Williams\n\nCompilation edit by Pedra\nSONY Handycam HDR-CX405 9.2 megapixels\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brasil, end of 2020.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme78BMxgrFSBPQsZSoyJC5oSyK31RM8ijh69xNhvmGjU1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcqMm9d4gKnMiHBrmNtBoAVdDBz6KwN7Krc4g67Sjotmb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme78BMxgrFSBPQsZSoyJC5oSyK31RM8ijh69xNhvmGjU1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1P12stN2XgUNoHngswEQTjQi81kFuWxvVS"], "tags": ["GIF", "Photosequence", "Queer", "Brasil", "VideoPerformance"], "extra": {}}
