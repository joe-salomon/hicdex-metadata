Technique test (might replace with a proper attempt later)\nSkill: Medium to high - see a master like garisedelweiss for mindblowing high.\nTime: A rougher sketch like this can be an hour or so plus a bit of colouring. I tried stippling like the pros and do not have the patience - many hours for sure.\nSecrets: This is an old sketch of mine I just re-coloured\nComments: I should try this more intentionally - it's fun de-coupling colour from value and working on one at a time.
