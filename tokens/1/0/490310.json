Weasle, however, believes that he is far more intelligent that everyone else, and insists on being the one to come up with the plants (which is what he mistakenly calls the plans). Weasle is also a big believer in the conspiracy theory that the colony is not on another planet at all, but in fact simply on the underside of a flat Earth, and he has a theory that if everyone goes to one side of the disc and jumps in the air at once, when they land the whole thing will flip over. While he\u2019s not sure what that would achieve, exactly, he theorises that it would be \u2018pretty cool\u2019 and that it \u2018couldn\u2019t make things any worse\u2019.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR3PcDnoHNfVEvArrsEYfnWypdkNSmW6ViUcxfqxg13pW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmauXBtzpwheC2UgmesapSkccdMHPUswb2AMu31k9wPKHm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR3PcDnoHNfVEvArrsEYfnWypdkNSmW6ViUcxfqxg13pW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["Vessels"], "extra": {}}
