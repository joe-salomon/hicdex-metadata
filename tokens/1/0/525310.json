It is part of the group exhibition \"Now You See Me Now You Don't\", at the Orangerie, Munich, Nov 10-15th 2021 - https://dog-and-pony.com/nature/ which shows artworks that portray highly endangered species of animals and plants. I chose moss and lichen as my topic since whilst it might appear that those are still around in abundance, about 30% of moss and lichen species are on the brink of extinction due to air pollution and land use. --- I will donate 100% of the primary sales profits of this edition to the Finnish Natural Heritage Foundation, which is an NGO that promotes the protection of old growth forests by buying the land these forest stand on and preventing them from logging. I believe that this is a great cause to donate to since not only will it protect endangered animals and plants but it is also a way to reduce CO2 emissions.
