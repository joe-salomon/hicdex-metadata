YOU GOT TO TEL AVIV! is an exclamatory statement/sentence that emphatically stating that the other person they are talking to did indeed get to the city of Tel Aviv. 2. YOU GOT TO; TEL AVIV! is more of an exclamatory slogan to entice people to come to the city of Tel Aviv. As in, YOU GOT TO (come to); TEL AVIV! 3. YOU GOT TO TELL AVIV! is an exclamatory statement/sentence that delineates the other person needs to tell something to someone named Aviv. It's totally absurd, but it works. English is full (or rife...depending on what your take or vantage point is) of these kind of weird scenarios.
