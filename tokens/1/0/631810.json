{"__version": 1, "token_id": 631810, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Carbon Trap", "description": "Carbon Trap is a sound work influenced by the atmosphere inside a kiln where soot it trapped on the surface of a pot. Often I think of sending my sounds into a \u201cprocessing kiln\u201d. I get the sounds hot and then attach other sounds and atmosphere onto the sounds. A composition is then constructed with these glazed sounds. I also subject my video recordings to such treatments. Eric\u2019s program feels very close to the way I work with sound and video.\n\nA carbon trap also reminds us of Donna Haraway's book Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene. Haraway speaks of three paths for humanity in relationship to climate change. We decided to give up, we think we can create a technological fix (carbon traps perhaps), or the third option Haraway provides  is to stay with the trouble, to figure out ways to live in a capitalistic ruined earth. The color of the 3D form is reminiscent of a heat map, and the feedback the ascends upward as do our emissions.  \n\nInteractive visuals was built by Eric Souther. The album is developed in Web.gl, it may take a moment to load and sound to start. You can use XY touch or mouse to move the 3d form. You can also click on the button top left and open up the control panel. This allows for you to control different aspects of the feedback. Click on the control panel again to minimize.
