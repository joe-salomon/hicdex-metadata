It stands for dimethlytriptamine and it is a key ingredient in the Amazonian shamanic brew ayahuasca. When consumed, DMT fits snuggly into the most wide and important network in the human brain: the serotonin system. If drunk as part of the ayahuasca brew, the experience usually lasts for 4 to 8 hours. If smoked, it\u2019s action is much shorter. It has a peak experience of 3 to 5 minutes and fully back to baseline, or ordinary reality, in 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nDMT is the GOD molecule that allows us to face the code of reality itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRq5JnnLFy9Um8UkggWZ2C5nCc3YNyMkUjDGuTcd3c5dA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQd1rPZddavsiLqgp5GBvhEosETNakD1VkZRU5JhRmWiu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRq5JnnLFy9Um8UkggWZ2C5nCc3YNyMkUjDGuTcd3c5dA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2TfVWLwZMkdfZTUdkyPSGEJxcYzp5VAro5"], "tags": ["dmt", "elves", "terence", "mckenna", "trip", "psicoactive", "digitalart", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
