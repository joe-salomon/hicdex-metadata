It had recently rained in the area, in between rain showers in fact. We had a moment where the weather was just right for exploring the park for finding photographic gems. This was just a puddle with a reflection that I really liked. What I did in post production made it really fun. I brought an orange hue to the sky and kept a nice blue in the puddle, making a split personality sunset that adds extra character to this fun piece of colorful artwork. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRzk8dcptbMTT8LbACNwd8HwpamM4hJms4GMA7Vq1a3kY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXhrSxPF1rKahHR9E1KjjTyotaQMJ5A6nsEWMsWySQENS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRzk8dcptbMTT8LbACNwd8HwpamM4hJms4GMA7Vq1a3kY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["sunset", "park", "photography", "reflection", "beautiful"], "extra": {}}
