{"__version": 1, "token_id": 632910, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Zeus", "description": "Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythology and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Jupiter, Perk\u016bnas, Perun, Indra, and Dyaus.\n\nZeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many divine and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfQxTZvPkfa2jV1U7kJubPGgy5vwEtgJ52XLHNbvyrE6A", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUSND7TVK1w5tW6fvcwtU3c8hBPFJycKQZtvgCVkrp7gQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfQxTZvPkfa2jV1U7kJubPGgy5vwEtgJ52XLHNbvyrE6A", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4FrYfMq3J2hRxaanXSH7A1GRR9Sms6ZN"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
