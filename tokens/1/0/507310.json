I specifically saw the \"E\"s forming the glass and the rest of the word in the background negative space somewhat caressing it, as if to say here drink, have a good time. Reminds me of the time I first tried champagne and felt the bubbles go up my nose after ingestion. What a funny memory of something so simple. It's the quiet moments in life that we need to not necessarily hold onto, but guide us towards better choices in the present. To live in the past is regression. To live in the present is progression. To live in the future is ascension. Here's to the future! (adults, put down the book and pour yourself a glass of champagne or whatever spirits you have lying around. Kids, get some juice. This is your cue to raise your champagne glass) Cheers to you all and thank you for getting this far in the book; it's a miracle.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNw1MTDJeqmqrTqHNexpBgYS2F4QPGXLpwEj55WJEZoZu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWHaLprf4kHxDvNCLbkCyqD8kp2vcR4pANd1L5eji8KxD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNw1MTDJeqmqrTqHNexpBgYS2F4QPGXLpwEj55WJEZoZu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
