Boldly, wildly, beautifully, uncertainly, imperfectly, magically lived.\nAll the illusory thoughts we have are our perception of the world. Spirits do not belong to this synthetic world. According to metaphysics, we are all the same. \n\nNo color, no shape, no form. This project brings the universality of spirits together in digital by using all colors, shapes, and forms.\n.\nWhile this project includes many dominant colors and sharp effects, it also explains that the spirit is not tied to any color or form with this distinction.\n\nEach work contains a human emotion such as fear, love, and curiosity, etc.\n.\nWhen all the colors are combined, the color white appears.\n\nWhen these works come together, nothingness like the soul exists.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNwqWaK2JQ8JhPghLWxcswsKLMLgpkBTGGkqWzu1wYWtX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVjYbLRQWWLzbSzcAdN4P8GYqcf59avMKx8e6rTsHQY49", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNwqWaK2JQ8JhPghLWxcswsKLMLgpkBTGGkqWzu1wYWtX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R22hNnk1hdVBWRhwZfKe5ZGzhoDYqpQcy"], "tags": ["color", "design"], "extra": {}}
