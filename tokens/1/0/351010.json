{"__version": 1, "token_id": 351010, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Vigeland, Circa 3050", "description": "\"Vigeland, Circa 3050\" was created as part of the Perfection/Speculation artist residency. This piece is a speculative response to how Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, may sculpt the human form in the year 3050.\n\nPRAKSIS OSLO, Residency 18: Perfection / Speculation proposes a multi-disciplinary investigation of the meanings and ethics of genetic technologies. \n\nPerfection / Speculation connects with body cultures of the past, present and future. It is supported by a dynamic relationship between its two residency partners: the Vigeland Museum and queer live events co-ordinators Karmaklubb*. The project revisits the work of Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland (1869-1943) to investigate past and future constructions of gender, race, sexuality, age, body politics, and the notion of the ideal human. Building on Karmaklubb*\u2019s agendas, it aims to probe the social and digital cultures arising from discussions and practices around genetics and the body, and to establish a hub within global conversations about future impacts of design technologies on our bodies.
