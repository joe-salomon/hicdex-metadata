It belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). This medicine acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. When it is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPg81qyzFpJa8PWUedJkdwWsK2PvhM15McCphBoU8xGTR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPg81qyzFpJa8PWUedJkdwWsK2PvhM15McCphBoU8xGTR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPg81qyzFpJa8PWUedJkdwWsK2PvhM15McCphBoU8xGTR", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "nft", "collectible"], "extra": {}}
