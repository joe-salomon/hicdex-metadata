Verbal or invitation to have sex with threats. The regulations that the DPR drafted always run aground in the middle of the road. In reporting to the authorities (police), victims always find it difficult to provide solid evidence. Often cases of victims of violence become suspects because they are reported back for defamation cases. This resulted in many victims who ultimately did not report to the police. The existence of a reporting agency for victims seems far from bright hopes for victims.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcAkjjnSSJ1LombqUfqHq4jNERo3tcVPbX2FhKaaF4cYY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmReaJk4jG19V8u1szUUUDGVcQnLsR6Dz1mCSAkyev4Bos", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcAkjjnSSJ1LombqUfqHq4jNERo3tcVPbX2FhKaaF4cYY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DXDS3piK3ucRxJS25j9j3Pu6fXcU8oWy5"], "tags": ["#photography#feminist#tezos"], "extra": {}}
