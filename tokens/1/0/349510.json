{"__version": 1, "token_id": 349510, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Echoes", "description": "Echoes (2020/08/20, R code). This generative artwork was released as a limited edition mint [1/150] on Hic Et Nunc by Kenny Vaden. This piece was one of the first that used a custom function that I wrote to compute rotated square tiles, based on the slope of an underlying line segment. The image set up ten layers of randomly jittered and additive lines, ordered from left to right. Each layer used slightly larger tiles, with less transparent colors that transitioned to a color gradient that randomly switched from left to right directions. Before the last layer, a partiality transparent yellow circular polygon was randomly placed near the left side, and the last layer of lines was drawn in black with minor changes in spacing and additivity. This creates the silhouetted opening to see the layers of lines through. The original artwork did not use a seeded randomizer, which is why this looks subtly different from that one after locating a seeded randomization that would produce similar colors and composition. The image dimensions for this file are 20x20 inches and resolution is 300 DPI, which produced a file size below the limit, which provides a higher resolution (more detail) than the original version shown online.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRMxHEVBGQyi6qiYEs7pCkD6kt18hvm2xghhLbjBwJ3jv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQqn9bWfUhy112Q9y8SKZQYAQ9grSPtM3EP9HbMUPdp6q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRMxHEVBGQyi6qiYEs7pCkD6kt18hvm2xghhLbjBwJ3jv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bEHdSDNdTTPmuin84c6LWqruepu6a5sc5"], "tags": ["Squares", "Waves", "Lines", "GenerativeArt", "RCode"], "extra": {}}
