{"__version": 1, "token_id": 579610, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "GLITTERY BOX", "description": "This was one the longest syntax crystal word pyramids I've ever encountered. GLITTERY BOX takes a few new chances creatively compared to previous versions. The first thing we notice that's different is that there's slashes through each of the lines. This was purely for experimental purposes and so was adding a 2nd word to the word pyramid. Previously the word pyramids were only one word each. With the advent of a 2nd word, we're creating new possibilities and an expansion of these pyramids. Over a period of months, have you been noticing that we're seeing an increase of complexity, even though the artworks are still minimal in nature. I love this push and pull between simplicity and complexity. Some days the work gets intensely complex and other days we revert to a simple form to press reset, I suppose. Venturing out into unknown territory can be challenging, but with passion and truth at your side...you can't fail.
