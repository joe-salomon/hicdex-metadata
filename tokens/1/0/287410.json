Dajj\u0101l will appear during a period of great tribulation. He will work false miracles, and most people will be deceived. \n\nAs we enter the miraculous age of Artificial Intelligence, all these myths and descriptions around the figure of Dajj\u0101l are becoming more of a self fulfilled prophecy. And it seems like the dawn might already be here.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicdf2fkifa7kqtw2iuygqfkhdlxjpkrtot6kzxnhsodozgusr3g3a", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiggp6d2gtng4oqhclpkqfrnzwfczgmcoqsfc2g4ar3bpy254ni4ii", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicdf2fkifa7kqtw2iuygqfkhdlxjpkrtot6kzxnhsodozgusr3g3a", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Vab9z6QP8DgDii6cANHEAfCgZajPt4YHQ"], "tags": ["DawnoftheDajjal", "OBJKT4OBJKT", "GAN", "vocalmusic", "xhabarabot", ""], "extra": {}}
