But the root meaning in the bible comes from Hebrew word hevel,which means\"vapor\".\nSo in Ecclesiastes the line \"vanity of vanities! All is vanity\" does not mean Everything is meaningless which a lot of people misunderstand it for, but it means... everying is fleating.. Like a like a life of a bubble.
