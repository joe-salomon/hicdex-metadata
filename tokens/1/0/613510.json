Each artwork belongs to a visual conversation made on DADA, the only platform in the world where people speak to each other through drawings, creating collaborative art.\n\nThis curated collection with a Halloween theme officially launched on October 31, 2017. It comprises 108 unique artworks made by 30 artists on DADA. The 2017 ERC20 Creeps have a total of 16,600 digital editions with 5 different levels of scarcity, which represent the significance of the visual conversations that the artworks belong to.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme63qrmrchHadU7nENBg4aAowfoQTG1MUdUoYzLvGYtZ9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYYssHjMJifqV9vYGA53jhqcm9Tdx97mVxjCcx8CCVCbV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme63qrmrchHadU7nENBg4aAowfoQTG1MUdUoYzLvGYtZ9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VThyJUrYAgjqmycTFWSdJ4T1hbs5okKkK"], "tags": ["DADA", "creeps", "weirdos", "collection", "drawing", "cryptoart"], "extra": {}}
