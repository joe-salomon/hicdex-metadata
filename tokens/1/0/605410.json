It serves as a sense of release.\n\nIt is the sixth song from the debut album, State. The work and animations featured in the State series represent the rebirth as an artist and is the culmination of five years of work. The album and animated series allowed a sense of liberation to create and make the Bases project what it is today. This work serves as the foundation. \n\nThis is the sixth animation in the series and it will not be minted elsewhere. \n\nMusic by Darryl Kirchner \nArtwork and Animation by Darryl Kirchner ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVVAu3mheA3vioWGyYN7EsuecEGiBeXszprVkVjW719SE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSFKdiEgUoGXqJn1uYTdR18By4367g5uCmdo1pyuCMcVT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSFKdiEgUoGXqJn1uYTdR18By4367g5uCmdo1pyuCMcVT", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVVAu3mheA3vioWGyYN7EsuecEGiBeXszprVkVjW719SE", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1g9wxVbu5EKBeSqeGFoKSBnPKvxJnpKcsw"], "tags": ["animation", "music", "illustration", "nftmusic", "geometric", "nostalgia", "house", "housemusic"], "extra": {}}
