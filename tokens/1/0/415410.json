{"__version": 1, "token_id": 415410, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Morondanga Republik: Peppo of Intuition", "description": "The official religion in Morondanga Republik is Peppology. It became the exclusive religion of this country by a decree of King Filomenus, at the time of the monarchy. It is said that the king, under the effects of the vapors of The Night of the Frogs, saw various creatures who appeared before him and asked to be honored under strange rituals or else the country would burn in flames. \n\nPeppos are hermaphrodite beings that live in swampy areas. When the right rituals are performed, they help and give shelter to the desperate. One of them is Peppo of Intuition. \n\nThey are playful and sensual and prefer swampy waters rather than dry surfaces. They usually appear hidden in pipes or near freshly washed clothes, because some say they are attracted to the smell of fabric softener.\n\nThey are the favorite Peppo of Olga Muriel, the renowned psychic and fortune teller. It is known that Olga collects several figurines, being her collection the biggest one dedicated to this Peppo, of all the Republik.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTsz6muXg18eJ2Pw8S7Zc1T5HD8XprVeytnBUfk8J7NWF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV5PFmvbKHMy445MJypZG1iYDKnK8r7wapQYCgBnVGVW7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTsz6muXg18eJ2Pw8S7Zc1T5HD8XprVeytnBUfk8J7NWF", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Peppo", "Morondanga", "Stamp", "Illustration", "Intuition"], "extra": {}}
