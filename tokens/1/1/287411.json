In order to change something in life, we must be humble enough to accept our flaws and mistakes before we can fix them and move on.\n\nI hope no matter how ugly and uncomfortable our flaws are, we can deal with them so we can be the most beautiful version of ourselves.\n\nThis artwork is also part of OBJKT4OBJKT.
