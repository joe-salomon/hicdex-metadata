Exotic residents of the cosmos. Gems of rare beauty and power. Contemplative and active observers of creation and destruction. Each has a story to tell and a history to uncover. Be open to connect and it will share its secrets with you.\n\nSpace Oddity is a project inspired by my love for space, physics, and more personally, my exploration of self-acceptance and self-love. The space oddities start their journey as watercolor on paper and grow into digital mixed media. The creative process for this project has been challenging, fun, and deeply therapeutic and so am very excited to share it with you. May your journey into the world of space oddities lead you to greater appreciation of your own rare story and beauty.
