He is the responder to all needs, invitations, and prayers. Whenever one needs help in difficulties, they should call upon this name of Allah.\n\nAnd to Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said, \u201cO my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it, so ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive.\u201d (Quran 11:61)\n\nAnd He answers [the supplication of] those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases [for] them from His bounty. But the disbelievers will have a severe punishment. (Quran 42:26)\n\nIs He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember.
