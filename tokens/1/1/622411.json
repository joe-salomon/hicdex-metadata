Beatrix was one of the key people in the society during that time, as she was the one who controls the strings in the royal community.\n \nAlthough the Swinton couple was known as the most loving couple in the capital (from the outside), her husband had a horrible abusive habit every time the couple got into a fight.\n\nEventually, Beatrix learned that without power, even the closest and the most trusted person in her life could turn their knives towards her anytime they want. Every night she sneaked out from her mansion and joined parties filled with politicians, business people, merchants, and socialites, she learned how to gain people's trust and connections. \n\nOne day she found out that her husband had many affairs behind her back and threatened to kick her out of the mansion without giving her a single penny. Beatrix turned the table around, with her brain and her social skills, she used her own money and created a successful business that stepped over her husband's. \n\nEventually, Mr. Swinton lost his good reputation and went bankrupt, he then became a puppet controlled by her wife, because of his greed.\n\n*This artwork is available for (NFT - Digital purpose Only)*", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmen1Kke3N1ZYpii5FYD24yfkZhbzenipBowLZCPdZA6eX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfQpQBfbvWwKZhPid7JUWZ36Z2nHjTACNfXCQGCR9smvW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmen1Kke3N1ZYpii5FYD24yfkZhbzenipBowLZCPdZA6eX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2PJey1iHahKMn31CHeUjcpv24fHp77x9LK"], "tags": ["renaissance", "renaissancepainting", "oilpainting", "medieval", "artwork", "classicalrealism"], "extra": {}}
