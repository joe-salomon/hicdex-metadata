Made on arches coldpress 200gsm paper with A2 size (420x594mm). \n\nThis is one of the larger painting works that I have made so far.\n\nThrough working on this painting I just thought that I enjoyed doing it and enjoyed every bit of process in this art work. Using my favorite colors, the object I like, mix and match it with pleasure.\n\nI also think that every work of art which creates into the world is the epitome of personal life experience of each artist.\n\nWith Love,\nSTAVEZE\n\n-\n\nWatercolor painting on Arches CP 200gsm A2\n3580 \u00d7 2448 Pixel\n\nPersonal Use Only", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYqpTsnVNqbcju6B36SRgCFm4sQkk8boQELfdZuBfnpTc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP153xWX7nvrKqyDtCk6niP7FbJ9LfeQz6whK7Yb85oZ4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYqpTsnVNqbcju6B36SRgCFm4sQkk8boQELfdZuBfnpTc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29sYfPxwGkT5Uogy3NNgRdvRzKukHe4s9k"], "tags": ["watercolor", "painting", "illustration", "acrylic", "artwork", "traditionalart", "art", "still", ""], "extra": {}}
