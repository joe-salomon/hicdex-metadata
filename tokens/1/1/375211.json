Allow it to happen the way it can in the precious space at the center of this drawing. It\u2019s surrounded and protected. Our bodies have incredible healing abilities if\nwe give them the rest and attention they need. There is deep healing occurring even if you can\u2019t see the results on the outside. Allow yourself to heal, be kind to yourself. Let the body heal, let the mind heal, let the spirit heal. Open your heart and allow yourself to be filled with love in the moment, filled with the sounds the sights and the sensations that let you know you\u2019re alive and here right now. Notice your breath as it flows in and out of your body nourishing your cells. If the mind wanders to negative thoughts that take you out of the here and now bring your attention back to your breath and then the sights and sounds of where you are right now. Relax into this moment and feel the breath as your muscles soften then lengthen allowing deeper breaths and an expansion of the moment outward. Let yourself expand outward as you breathe peacefully.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbqQ9qdE7yZNX4AR99qvgf7kkmHR4mCPXCS1k8dCLz2tR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWTD1YV2eoLbQVFp7mTFoo2xtYYQNhhhDxxtrJjYC8WkQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbqQ9qdE7yZNX4AR99qvgf7kkmHR4mCPXCS1k8dCLz2tR", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
