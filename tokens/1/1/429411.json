At its heart is the simplicity of the square, the fundamental concept of the grid and a constraint of working in monochrome. This then distorts into something else.

But at the boundaries is where the interest lies. \n\nhttps://www.interpunct.studio/blog/borg\n\n150 editions were produced, each minted edition is unique.
