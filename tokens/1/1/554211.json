The clouds were turbulent this morning, even without any rain and the wind was fierce. The perspective here is around the area of Evelyn Lake in the central part of the park.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcjbmJS74arHr7REQrQQaABBDan7sB1ELTZerA6RExDNE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaPvVgUqxK8wYPBsXREaNUA8AotS1QdUVnu6WZVp93Ngw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcjbmJS74arHr7REQrQQaABBDan7sB1ELTZerA6RExDNE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Q3UPthREkbUPjKWKhvtbx2PZfXNCoxCBy"], "tags": ["wilderness", "mountain", "mountains", "backcountry", "backpacking", "clouds", "yosemitenationalpark", "yosemite", "california", "nps", "sierras", "sierramountains"], "extra": {}}
