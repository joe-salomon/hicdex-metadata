Someday, she decided to go outside of her cage which was so far a way from the city.\nFeeling so excited that she would meet with many people out there. \n\nBut, when she got there, unfortunately, it was not something what she \nexpected it would be. Everyone got scared. Angers were everywhere tried to hush her out. They talked bullshit about her. \n\nShe got confused. Asking to herself why this is happened. What's wrong with me. She thought. Then, someone yelled, \"Dont ever get closer, you witch!\"\n\nNow, she knew. She was different from the others. Her presence was not expected. But, she got up, and set her head up, kept walking ahead.\n\nShe smiled and covered her ears and said \n\n\"I might be different. I might be not accapted by everyone. But most important things are i wont hear, i wont care and i just love myself so much.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRyqz4eSbw34aCDDcgme37CceogP7BMZQiciW4xr5hMHf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRXETsmuo191jEwZVUpyRL7FL8bR6VJzJhgZ4WiuqKtBS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRyqz4eSbw34aCDDcgme37CceogP7BMZQiciW4xr5hMHf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KhjPrCJR6Xo9tsyFrfVDswodzpmpDPddJ"], "tags": ["witch", "halloween", "2d", "digitalart", "selflove", "different", "illustration", "purple", "orange", "thewitch", "anger", "love", "confident"], "extra": {}}
