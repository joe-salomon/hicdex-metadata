I was here when people from across the ocean landed on a big island. I was here when they welcomed them with an open hand but returned it with swords and blood. I was here when both foreign-people swap Rhun and New Amsterdam. I was here when the survivor leave behind their home and sail across the sea to find another. I was here when then, and I'm still here now.\"\n\nThis old Canarium tree was photographed in Big Banda Island, Banda Archipelago, Maluku, Indonesia.
