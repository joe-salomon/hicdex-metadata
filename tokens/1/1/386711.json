I have a very distinct scent. I am always cheerful, and i love the sun. I have 80 family members, and i absolutely love Honey Bees.\nEdible Flowers\nAn important feature of all nasturtiums is their edibility! Nasturtiums\u2019 leaves, flowers, and seedpods have a peppery, almost mustard-like taste, which makes them lovely as a garnish in salads. The seedpods may also be pickled and used like capers.\nABOUT NASTURTIUMS\nThese lovely plants, with their unique greenery and vibrant flowers, grow well in pots or as ground cover around vegetable gardens. In fact, they are often used as a trap crop in companion planting, drawing aphids and other garden pests away from the more valuable vegetables. \n\nNasturtium is a friend of: bean, broccoli, cabbage, cucumber, kale, melon, pumpkin, and radish.\nPests aren\u2019t the only thing nasturtiums attract, however. They are also a favorite of pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds, and their pretty fragrance makes them a good choice for cut-flower gardens, too. \n\nNasturtiums are grown as annual plants in most areas, though they may perennialize in frost-free zones.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeZLdPjfBiuGhpSM695cJKEEXcD7jxhmJ3CBs3GECpayD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNowH1K3pAezfeDH9DbRSM1oLMyRfqvMGmTkVyq6fkPHX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeZLdPjfBiuGhpSM695cJKEEXcD7jxhmJ3CBs3GECpayD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1W36Pzt8ev5HjN5rXpn1mwnkUW1nAhLV4G"], "tags": ["edibleflowers", "Nasturium", "flowers", "companionplants", "wonderful", "rainbows", "happiness", "sun", "earth", "water", "love"], "extra": {}}
