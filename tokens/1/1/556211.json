I was walking around enjoying the sunset on Kedonganan beach while hunting for photos, I saw teenage children playing surfing alternately on the surging sea waves near the beach. They take turns surfing. Even though they only use 1 surfboard, they still enjoy and share happiness with each other.\nEven though they are still teenagers, they hone their surfing skills to stay stable in mastering the waves, not being carried away by the waves. I took a few moments and recorded this photo moment.\nLike our life, don't let external or internal factors interfere with your goals, you have to control yourself and determine what you really want.\nSo the question for us is, are our lives independent? Am I still trapped or controlled by something else? What do I really want to do now?\nA toast to those of us who are trying or who have already achieved what we want and are trying to achieve something new that we want. \nHey, don't forget to stay YOUNG and FREE!!!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYJd2rvGcrDcdwjFMYZJm2bes3gwLh3DUYWixuNL6TLc9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbW3v75VnwzSyg4mTjJxh69kUiAMdRyonD4Ey9iUCAqKD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmcrX8GijAwU5rSpAPwmgQyhdiEZ81CMQ1tzDEdqbf7tkR", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYJd2rvGcrDcdwjFMYZJm2bes3gwLh3DUYWixuNL6TLc9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2GATqUMUFHMLu8oq2X2zKjWsrY5qA52RCL"], "tags": ["photography", "digitalarts", "digitalimaging", "bali"], "extra": {}}
