This is otherwise known as the Far From Origin problem. \n\n2000x2000, 18 frames, .gif, 1.5MB\n\n@luisfraguada\nhttps://linktr.ee/fraguada\n\nmodel credits: \"Octopus \ud83d\udc19\" (https://skfb.ly/opvx9) by Nyilonelycompany is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV5jUEs8zb6HtpqxuDwRUgHoKhmNEA7xqQ9PZ7nHxeuS9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV5jUEs8zb6HtpqxuDwRUgHoKhmNEA7xqQ9PZ7nHxeuS9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmV5jUEs8zb6HtpqxuDwRUgHoKhmNEA7xqQ9PZ7nHxeuS9"}], "creators": ["tz1SeV6vmY1nR6xuDPXRx1tWsrhqXCwmXL2j"], "tags": ["\ud83d\udc19", "3d", "iso", "normal", "isometric", "cephalopoda", "arithmetic", "floatingpoint", "precision", "error", "farfromorigin"], "extra": {}}
