Rustam was always represented as the mightiest of Iranian paladins ( holy warriors ) and the atmosphere of the episodes in which he features is strongly reminiscent of the Parthian period. He was immortalized by the 10th century Persian poet Ferdowsi in the Shahnameh, or epic of kings, which contains pre-Islamic Iranian folklore and history.\n\n\n The Shahnameh (\u201cBook of Kings\u201d, composed 977-1010 CE) is a medieval epic written by the poet Abolqasem Ferdowsi (l. c. 940-1020 CE) in order to preserve the myths, legends, history, language, and culture of ancient Persia. It is the longest work by a single author in world literature at a length of 50,000 rhymed couplets, 62 stories, and 990 chapters.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ7SHkdxrLHsYQLtXLWxaNhJiaMgTcDGwV9W2xQGqVcmx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVLvjJuTad6GVKPjr5CsnmjWDgSs2hwcVS64Krtxkjxey", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ7SHkdxrLHsYQLtXLWxaNhJiaMgTcDGwV9W2xQGqVcmx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["collectable", "colorful", "character", "illustration", "2d", "cute", "rosstam", "generative"], "extra": {}}
