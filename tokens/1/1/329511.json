Since I'm thinking of immersing myself in a state, I can better contemplate art.\n\nI convey state through an expressive approach to sculpture. Where there are many sensory reactions in terms of perception of both the world of metaphysics and the physical world.\n\nThe SPLIT reflects both Dionysian and Apollonian aspects. I am more inclined towards art, which carries both a rational and a sensual response to the world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW9W9JaaGtwgLNvJJoBEMNzfvr3g21zSRwhgtp5cjP9HW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdE8k1Nw3M4ag2zFCENwUC8atr2UA5DaJqZYtmiJdWW4x", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW9W9JaaGtwgLNvJJoBEMNzfvr3g21zSRwhgtp5cjP9HW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gi7Vd6S1uxYPGKw1oyD4MDwbfBvLyJgVS"], "tags": ["#cleannfr#sculpture"], "extra": {}}
