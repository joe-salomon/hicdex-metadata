I took one of those walks where he discovered love with R\u00e9gine Olsen, and experienced one of the most beautiful and pathetic love stories of his century. The city was inhabited by the ghosts of my reading. Late at night, deep in a dark bar in the old town, drunk with friends, I saw this woman. I could never say it wasn't Regine's ghost, who was still waiting for him.
