After the era of man came the glyphosate rains, which picked up over the summer months.  The extreme moist heat, combined with the parched earth caused the dust to kick up with tumult; the sky turned dark and the clouds appeared red.\n\nIt was during these times, some of the most significant changes occurred in the organisms that survived the Anthropocene.   \n\n..\n\nSummer Glyphosate Rains is part of a four foot hand drawn scroll on kozo paper, drawn with colored pencil, gouache, and charcoal.
