She is glamorous, beautiful, clad in headgear of various hues of green. You pause and look closer. Is she... Does her neck resemble the trunk of a majestic tree? If so, is her headgear less fashion and more like the top of a tree? A glamorous, gorgeous, alluring tree. It depends on what you see in this artwork. Imagination brings her into our brains and makes us want to know her story. What is her story?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYnAZtobRhyL1ZT8Cxmx31FHBuqo2GgCTySDEn9ZVfzPG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYnAZtobRhyL1ZT8Cxmx31FHBuqo2GgCTySDEn9ZVfzPG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYnAZtobRhyL1ZT8Cxmx31FHBuqo2GgCTySDEn9ZVfzPG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1X1ToMENirSHmj89avqhfxhRZpqiiXNohX"], "tags": ["woman", "mystery", "headgear", "hat", "flapper", "fashion", "glamour", "beauty", "tree", "trunk", "branches", "green"], "extra": {}}
