The videos were conceived with the use of a couple of digital tree photographs. One of which is from the trunk of an old plane, and the other one being from a Texas Madrone.\nBy ascribing properties such as time and movement, and by changing other attributes belonging to the software in use, the images saturate in appearance and yield to something unlike their primal nature. Transcending state, permeating matter, the organism expands into a phenomen. An abnormal happening, a dejected form, an abjected presence. A circuitry of the present in evolution, of a chroma-cosmic amorphous signal, always becoming, in each and each passing, in trace of its roots. The image swirling, detached from the habitual, but in narration, of affect and sensation. A zone of immanence, contemplating on the finite, the spatial and temporal, and the aesthetics of detachment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdPfd6bFmCY4iDG89RneXTnfjjTtJEGqFdESSHpJqckHr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmejGD2dEJHJoCxWAqP4jSGv2kHeVHjTAqmtxBT8MrEZek", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdPfd6bFmCY4iDG89RneXTnfjjTtJEGqFdESSHpJqckHr", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2DFyQD5thSTVoGGRR5efBt8xt5itV1WueT"], "tags": ["videoart", "expressionism", "digitalart", "tree", "newmedia"], "extra": {}}
