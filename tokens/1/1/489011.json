The continuation of 'Su\u0308nshine' - a good old friend of mine that I had a karmic relationship with. I wrote 'You\u0308 Got Me Like' to deal and heal from my heartbreak. This is my last song about him and it's about my struggles to accept the fact that I had to let go of him and all that we had. Letting go of the ones we Love deeply is never easy. But that doesn't mean we don't or kan't Love them for eternity. Even if the Love was just temporary, but we'll always have the good memories.\n\nPlease visit www.pinktank.art for more information.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWpKRoEqTjjAk7TQmQuRaBf7PY9x2f1qMwFg1GHVV4Rqu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPzunvUCsVjbCdE2XSseSuA64E7nbf77ew3ZuheV9ZjJt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWpKRoEqTjjAk7TQmQuRaBf7PY9x2f1qMwFg1GHVV4Rqu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Me1CjbfEi43zUyas22UatiqC48zxY9wzm"], "tags": ["PinkTank", "MasaMassa", "MalaysianArt", "MalaysiaNFT", "2021", "Genesis", "VideoArt", "LGBT", "MusicVideo", "Su\u0308nshine"], "extra": {}}
