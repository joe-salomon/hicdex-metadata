It questions what it means to prepare, serve and design a a meal; in this case it\u2019s padang food. Located in the Western part of Sumatra, padang food stalls are scattered all around Indonesia, notably known as the local fast food and most often than not eaten by hands. This exploration focuses on the sensorial experience of tasting when it is unconstrained, allowing for a heightened sense of taste as a result of eating with fingers. While sight is regarded as the noblest of senses in Western cultures, this decolonisation of senses through art and architecture questions this idealisation of sight and redistributes value to the other senses at play.\n\nCredits :\n\n>Producer + Scriptwriter\nArdini Azzah\n\n>Artwork + Storyline + Storyboard\nAlienpang\n\n>Video Animator + Editor + Music Scoring\nBronzelani\n\nThanks to EKRIG for contributed restaurant name ideas\n\n-2021\nby\u00a0zEtudio", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX3QZdKeucf7Rkpp6DEgLRgnYkQs4TEwL9gbFBcXWrFZW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQpUTCVHJsUi4NnddBGSYqpYX8f7Qbd2Y4hfiWYRXUowT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX3QZdKeucf7Rkpp6DEgLRgnYkQs4TEwL9gbFBcXWrFZW", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1X1Vvo7cxveKDPcsuLkpKaGRkQW8iZZTaW"], "tags": ["#fingerfood", "#2Danimation", "#westsumatra", "#padang", "#rumahmakanpadang", "#2D", "#human", "#motion", "#indonesia", "#3d", "#alienpang", "#alay", "#women", "#alien"], "extra": {}}
