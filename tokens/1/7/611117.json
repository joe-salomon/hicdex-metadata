This piece reminds me of television snow from when I was younger (very pre-streaming). It is that space in-between channels; before you find what you were looking for, but after you reject something else.\n\nThe piece morphs through 3 unique random number screens. They are entirely unique and impossible to repeat. Created in excel using a random number generator and then colour-coded according to a set distribution: \n\nWhite: ~1%, \nLight Grey: ~80%,\nDark Grey: ~13%, \nBlack: ~6%\n\nThis is the second in a series of \"Random Number Generated Art\". Ping me on Twitter if you liked it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUntVZMF63FTAN7xP1taftARee2kyqVSGU5XwxVtZURWS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUntVZMF63FTAN7xP1taftARee2kyqVSGU5XwxVtZURWS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUntVZMF63FTAN7xP1taftARee2kyqVSGU5XwxVtZURWS", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1a3JPpqJY3FeN7AWGT6zPk8WJ2TP9mv7t8"], "tags": ["excel", "number", "black", "white", "generated", "random", "randomnumber"], "extra": {}}
