A Ngaben is performed to release the soul of a dead person so that it can enter the upper realm where it can wait for it to be reborn or become liberated from the cycles of rebirths. The Balinese Hindu theology holds that there is a competition between evil residents of the lower realm to capture this soul, and a proper cremation enhances the chance that it may reach the upper realm.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUXjafgxMYawPGrJrmahAS7Px6Tn5NZPUqGQtMiy7jtz5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPcz8JXWVaNWBwQfQY5qTeD1vZrBFcgwLDr2PXGn6AdiV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUXjafgxMYawPGrJrmahAS7Px6Tn5NZPUqGQtMiy7jtz5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WyqapuXM2ieFydW1Q6g7DXPnbwAfZbw8D"], "tags": ["bali", "ritual", "digital", "illustration", "rakajana"], "extra": {}}
