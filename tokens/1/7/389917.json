It's almost impossible to see and it's often confused with blue or violet. I personally enjoy the quirky color and its controversial status. So much so, according to Isaac Asimov, \"It is customary to list indigo as a color lying between blue and violet, but it has never seemed to me that indigo is worth the dignity of being considered a separate color. To my eyes, it seems merely deep blue.\" I kind of believe in the pseudoscientific concept of indigo children, which are children who are believed to possess special, unusual, and sometimes supernatural traits or abilities. Maybe, I'm just crazy; you decide.(Side Note: This would be perfect for a mural or large scale installation with a giant visual light spectrum image adhered to a wall and the Indigo spectrum range would have 2 block lines running down perpendicular to delineate the small range that Indigo takes up on the spectrum.)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPnLPSnQkpUQVSKuuyDSX3ZDFs49SsCKVw9qbaUVbUBJa", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcb5LUTh6LdNzwZeHZR7BTuMjzU2R7ekumqs4qXky2H95", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPnLPSnQkpUQVSKuuyDSX3ZDFs49SsCKVw9qbaUVbUBJa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
