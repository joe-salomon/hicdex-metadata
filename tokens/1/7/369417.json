This version further simplifies the rules and introduces the possibility of autonomous variation of images.  \n\nA square is filled with a random color and divided into four parts. Each part can randomly:\n1) acquire the color of an adjacent square; \n2) undergo a change in tone, saturation, and lightness. \nThe subdivision and variations are applied recursively down to the single pixel. The infinite animation is obtained by randomly changing, at each frame, only some of the variations already defined.\n\nIt is recommended to activate the full-screen mode and click on the image when it is not possible to perceive any shape for a long time.\n\nAntonio Belluscio @livinbits - September 2021\n\nCredits: Alexei Boronine and Florian Dormont for the hsluv.js library used to make colors more human-friendly.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSMANTScs7RUT6sViZwxchGuKG7pkQUXtVJ17v8oDumdJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd8tq4GXdeDBCSR65DaQCbV64uvZUfiGP39TXH64t7gUy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSMANTScs7RUT6sViZwxchGuKG7pkQUXtVJ17v8oDumdJ", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1PAoZ7RxQrvvC2ceyVR7YGKFmgyLxs1ZEH"], "tags": ["diviso4", "diviso4hsl", "pixels", "generativeArt", "codeArt", "algorithmicArt", "creativeCoding", "pareidolia", "JavaScript", "random", "interactive", "generative", "procedural", "recursive", "recursion", "fractal"], "extra": {}}
