Noise is taken from circular motion on a 2D noise field with its own radius and offset. These values are mapped onto a range of colours according to one of seven different algorithms, and rotation is added to produce interference patterns with a choice from eight rendering modes.\nThe initial seed for this loop of 300 frames is 910672, which selects function 4 with offset (-85.0, 0.0), range (6.6999993, -1.0), and function 2 with offset (-34.0, -5.0), range (4.9999976, 3.2999988). Noise is produced from sampling points on an ellipse at co-ordinates (59.0, -23.0) with diameters (1.0, 1.0). The three formulae are combined using algorithm 7 with hue values starting at 331 with range 157. The grid is 151 units square.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXhsPXLVG2Vp6U3X3cP3PHujP5zRGX94z7wQN5t7WQdo6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXhsPXLVG2Vp6U3X3cP3PHujP5zRGX94z7wQN5t7WQdo6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXhsPXLVG2Vp6U3X3cP3PHujP5zRGX94z7wQN5t7WQdo6", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VjCS2jiBTVPSEoYzJ79KkbYV5QbFJxuf3"], "tags": ["xisal", "noise", "loop", "processing", "grid", "910672"], "extra": {}}
