I welcome all creative types. I personally don't like the term \"influencers\". It has this negative and over produced marketing feel to it that basically gives off the vibe that the people watching are sheep as if to have dominance in someone's choices to a certain extent. (But Andrew, come on this is marketing 101.) Yes, it is, but it just sounds like a horrific way to make people into cattle. I wouldn't mind if they called it \"content creators\", that works for me. For those who are content creators, keep doing your thing. Many of the \"Influencers\" of the world, have drank the ego kool-aid and have become faux famous. Not all of them, but there are ones that tell you to subscribe and follow and like and this and that and good god just shut the fuck up already, it's incessant; enough. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe, I'm just an old man living in a new world. Am I alone in this? Do you think they are self-contained eco or ego-systems of commerce?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXLx7h3syaLQ1TpjNtwcPX8g9onuKCSdCY7bPvXySRG6i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQGkiVpU2uB5vUPq2oCY9KrWeF3oEMSZeBf9RQL1L268m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXLx7h3syaLQ1TpjNtwcPX8g9onuKCSdCY7bPvXySRG6i", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
