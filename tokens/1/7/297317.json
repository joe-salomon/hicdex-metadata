Both can be isolated and distant, forget their glorious days, and silence and tranquility, little by little, are destroyed.\nBut sometimes, a ruin becomes important to someone! It becomes important! And that one person starts building and repairing and saving something that has accepted its own destiny.\nThis song is about the light of belief. A person's belief in someone who does not believe in himself.\n\nI made this song when I was tired of composing. But a friend of mine's interest in me made me get up, rebuild myself, and start over when all the doors seemed to be closed on me.\nThe interesting thing was that he commissioned me to make a piece of music that was to be placed on pictures of the reconstruction of an old theater. The hall, which was being forgotten, was gradually destroyed, but was revived according to its fans.\nI would like to express the moments of my life in these songs and share them with you here as a collection.\n\nMassoud Heydarian", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaod2iuq2mxthve45d7eibmu4hdspkx6ey3wthqg2immaz5c6lbi4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihofhvxzp4isn74sjc7u7awxn2c5vao5qxdge3ydyvrlarvlnnrlq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaod2iuq2mxthve45d7eibmu4hdspkx6ey3wthqg2immaz5c6lbi4", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XwW4rKyYiCcV7pgdx7eXZtfZUtRZ4qgfc"], "tags": ["music", "chill-out", "orchestral", "instrument", "Believe", "making", ""], "extra": {}}
