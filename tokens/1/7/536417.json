That for every attempt to establish meaning inevitably some meaning is lost to the universe\u2014thrown off like some invisible particle\u2014and, that it should be possible to represent this lost meaning in some way via abstract forms generated algorithmically from the original attempted act of communication. Previous works in the Gravity Engine series of series have featured 3D output not obviously readable as such. This new work represents a step towards readable 3D forms in 3D space + time.\n\nReturning to themes of global conservation while COP26 ensues in Glasgow, Alive\u2013Traces of Experience utilizes randomized text excerpts from an academic paper\u2014\u201cFunding for nature conservation: a study of public finance networks at World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)\u201d (Anyango\u2011van Zwieten et al, 2019)\u2014to highlight the gap between lived experience and the scale of socioeconomic change required to bring us in line with a flourishing biosphere.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUqdbBsjYqSjK1pqvjmGasv7a9nn1hZuhmMLTyCpDv9EC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYTnTFyJ38rMup5kPD3qrLs3nofLt17xnEMiDPdK6VHxU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUqdbBsjYqSjK1pqvjmGasv7a9nn1hZuhmMLTyCpDv9EC", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1R6AoJEzAotEbCZvPKMP6f3LsFWTeHf5tH"], "tags": ["mp4", "generative", "environmentalism"], "extra": {}}
