It's hard things for me to decide but I must do it because I want to drop more artworks with complex animation exclusively 1/1 edition not on HEN, I want to give my appreciation for anyone who want to collect it since complex animation takes more time & effort from me.\n\nI know it will be more obstacles ahead, but I will KEEP MOVING ON just like Sam on Death Stranding. So that's the idea behind this artwork.\n\nLFG! WAGMI! WML!
