{"__version": 1, "token_id": 480517, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "grid.token.art.03", "description": "Owners who collected and burned a grid.token get the chance receive a unique artwork created by Mark Knol. The artwork will be creatively and procedurally painted using provided avatar/photo/art of choice and send to their Tezos wallet as NFT. The collected grid will be the base for the new artwork.  \n---\n\nThis OBJKT is the first result of the burned \"grid.token.03\" (OBJKT #347715).\n\nPersonal note:  \nThis one has very special story. Clint requested to be this artwork to be based on his very own \"Convergence Series 6 #6\" (OBJKT #266478). But his artwork was actually a tribute and based on \"circular.grid.neon.01\" (OBJKT #243704) which is created by me. The circle is round. Thanks Clint!\n\nMore info about grid.tokens https://grid-tokens.stroep.nl/\n\ngrid.token.03 was claimed by \nClint Fulkerson (tz1VjaaBTjSEywNDdtHyQsdPKquDxKMwkmWp) @clintfulkerson", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ63cuXJjVNeKs2jssWwYZxPf821yv4Z4kM9rFHrM2xpz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ63cuXJjVNeKs2jssWwYZxPf821yv4Z4kM9rFHrM2xpz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ63cuXJjVNeKs2jssWwYZxPf821yv4Z4kM9rFHrM2xpz", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1XrutuvkFRG15HmV2gdon86F38NMMGMAXr"], "tags": ["generativeart", "gridtoken", "markknol"], "extra": {}}
