The bud was thought of in the seed. A tree needs the right conditions to grow, it needs soil, water and light. When it's time in the life of that particular tree it bears fruit. Let who you are at your core burgeon. Find what it is you need to blossom. Ask yourself these questions and write the answers down - What do you love? What fascinates you? What gifts do you have? What is seeking to emerge in your life?\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf4byi3z9yHAQdBDLkgrmp5FLd3Z3X2e9oUUNgU3dWEFh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPdRgYcekurP4w8aSmGCqum9P3kDqrbwuiiZLBTKUqvhs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf4byi3z9yHAQdBDLkgrmp5FLd3Z3X2e9oUUNgU3dWEFh", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
