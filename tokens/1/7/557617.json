I'm pretty sure the entire world took a deep breath and sighed with relief. Just three words described my reaction. ELECTION / EJECTION / ERECTION. These words may seem random, but they're carefully curated...let's go through it and see why. 1. All the words begin with an \"E\". 2. All the words end in \"ECTION\", which is a form of repetition for compositional purposes. 3. The words read from top to bottom create a narrative, which goes as follows: The 2020 US Presidential Election happened and Trump was ejected (peacefully and legally voted out of office) and subsequently made me feel aroused (used hyperbolically) with joy. The goal is to always say the most by saying the absolute least and make it look as interesting as possible using only words.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYmq8YspaxgFKEbinQ83UFdnRE2T8nHb7CA9nrbZ2G4HM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdmoezZqTfZG81Ji6ZH36xFF9m2fYpozPdWFof6pN5xbY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYmq8YspaxgFKEbinQ83UFdnRE2T8nHb7CA9nrbZ2G4HM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
