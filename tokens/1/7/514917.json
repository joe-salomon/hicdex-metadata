To me, words are the key to our soul. Without words we are blind. We can not express what we see. We can not explain what we hear. We can not communicate without words.  Words are the key to our soul.\n\nThese #NFTs are intended to be sold and NOT TO HOLD!  Read the #NFT message and just do it!\n\nBuy it and transfer it to others. Keep it moving until the end of time! \n\nThis NFT is the perfect \"ice breaker\" when talking about NFT for the first time.  \n\nThis project is about data #analytics to understand human behavior with regards to positive vs. negative #ChainLetterNFT messages.  Breaking the buy/hold mentality of NFTs to see positive vs. negative impacts of NFT #communities. \n\nThe first 33 wallets will get a free airdrop of the next NFT for supporting this project.  \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUNq9oA45ZzCtmoVjq62c4uhBj6npxFM9vaaXfobuYWw8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeSxNnCznduJdpHpWFAq8GkBxsxApB3oB53xP5AS5qgVp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUNq9oA45ZzCtmoVjq62c4uhBj6npxFM9vaaXfobuYWw8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Y6SsC3uwccxerYCFJcTk5EL7juLpWRKvD"], "tags": ["#superstition", "#cult", "#death", "#Bad_Luck", "#paranoia", "#negative_vibes", "#guilt", "#fear", "#human_behavior", "#33", "#Help!"], "extra": {}}
