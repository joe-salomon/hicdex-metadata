IV", "description": "For every amazing moment you've seen in the history of skateboarding, there were about 10 times the bails and probably 20 times the falls. Falling and getting hurt have to be one of the biggest deterrents from most people getting involved with or into skating. I mean it's a logical concern, no one ever wants to get hurt at doing something that they love. Yet still, a brash group of humans on a daily basis, defy gravity and common sense to dare. Dare to try to touch the sky. Dare to battle gravity. Dare to risk it all for momentary glory. Dare to progress the \"sport\" (hate that term). Dare to be an individual. Dare to be themselves. Dare to live another day to do it again tomorrow.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ1DAwX6e5iPew1Kquv4qpztN9WDMo6YJJPjMENF1yBsK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXTphCTrstACxGhWpiqtkvwzmG8tZi8zNUUSMedCUVBAn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ1DAwX6e5iPew1Kquv4qpztN9WDMo6YJJPjMENF1yBsK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
