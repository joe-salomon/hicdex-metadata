{"__version": 1, "token_id": 526017, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ALLOW ME TO ENJOY YOU. ALLOW ME TO DESTROY YOU.", "description": "Tommy Mandel is a keyboardist that has played, recorded, and toured with so many incredible recording artists over the years: Bryan Adams, Dire Straits, Bon Jovi, The Clash, Peter Wolf, Cyndi Lauper, and so many, many more just to name a few. From his 1981 solo album \"Tommy Mandel EP\", the track \"Allow Me To Destroy You\" is such a sonic revelation considering the time period it was released in and even when listening to it with contemporary ears, it still is an amazing experience. From the lyrics, to the arrangement, to the synth keyboards, and beyond...the song captivates your attention and makes you wonder how you have never heard this sound before. As an ode to this amazing song and artist, I've added, \"ALLOW ME TO ENJOY YOU.\" to the title of this track and thus create: ALLOW ME TO ENJOY YOU. ALLOW ME TO DESTROY YOU. If you've never heard this song, I highly recommend a listen or two; just remember this was written and made 40 years ago. I love weaving music references into my art as a way to make a tapestry of the love in my life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRXKUkp4ZVhLXcyvaY4v2YcNkrmoztk1c7inCnq2fBLoU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQSjfXAj7DirBz8ZmTfxrSw97TE6fcjYJKFZ4H6k5hYX7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRXKUkp4ZVhLXcyvaY4v2YcNkrmoztk1c7inCnq2fBLoU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
