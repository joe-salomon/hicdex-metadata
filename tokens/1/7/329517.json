The images of this collection are elaborated by compacting components of space, time and intention. The algorithm generate images by crushing cinematographic works. The generated image, a residual trace of time, synthesizes in a colorful atmosphere the history of the original movie. The process, like the mining of some crypto assets, need a long time of computer calculation and it's value can also be indexed on electrical energy.\nThis image is the residual trace of the movie \"Alien\" by Ridley Scott in 1979.\n\nImage properties: 6000x2500px, 150dpi, .png, printable", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQYJ6gqTVU1Mh1EcWGmCfK8n7RMATcyC75wwTfBKfz8QH", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf1GpERnzt9DxzgCWDA8h4HhynBLatoMsD1LiLSyAEJRS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQYJ6gqTVU1Mh1EcWGmCfK8n7RMATcyC75wwTfBKfz8QH", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SzTsJNtuHjitQqchKko1n18o3NBVnCpGk"], "tags": ["algorithm", "colors", "remix", "image", "generated", "movie", "abstract", "art", "atmosphere", "cloud"], "extra": {}}
