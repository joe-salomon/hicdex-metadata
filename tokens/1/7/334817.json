{"__version": 1, "token_id": 334817, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'LL NEVER LEAVE ME. / I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'LL NEVER GRIEVE ME.", "description": "Both of these sentences look and feel the same and yet they contain a powerful truth that hits to the core of being a conscious human being. You are the only person that will NEVER leave yourself and you are also the only person that will NEVER grieve for yourself when you die. There is no way around this. Anyone that lives, is conscious, and aware cannot escape this reality. Succinct poetry in the style of a beatnik or something you would imagine Jenny Holzer to have on one of her sculptures mixed with the brutal iron honesty of a Richard Serra, and the overall sense of enchantment of a James Turrell. These sentences for me are like two gigantic tree trunks, pillars of truth that can never be eroded away no matter how much time passes. These words are eternal. As long as people are born, live, and die...these sentences will always be true. A deep rooted truth using language, in the form of visual poetry, in a book, in a digitized image as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), as a conceptual work of art has to be the most meta I could think of. I hope you morbidly enjoy this one as much as I did creating it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRuN7QavJwhJgRmEvNaRr3492msQn3ajaoYCjVRf9gi2Q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZGXKmsmoQrTZWj8GUjaEcHk1VkeZGWFyhXm3iuuW6JqJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRuN7QavJwhJgRmEvNaRr3492msQn3ajaoYCjVRf9gi2Q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
