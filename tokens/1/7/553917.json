{"__version": 1, "token_id": 553917, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SURE END ENSURED ENDURES END USER", "description": "All of these words are anagrams of each other. Beneath or above each letter connects to another letter in another word. They're correlation lines and there is a specific pattern they work within. If a bunch letters are grouped together and shift over together, the line is a specific color to delineate this. If the letter doesn't move at all it is another specific color. If the letter is randomly shifted to another word it's a third color. Also there is another quasi-algorithm happening here as well. The very top word and the very bottom words are both two separate words. The middle words are almost exactly the same word except for the reversing of two letters: \"S\" and \"D\". One word says ENSURED and the other says ENDURES. I can't stress to you how crazy and seemingly random all of this is, but it is not. There are patterns within patterns within patterns like invisible quantum fields of influence and unknown forces holding it all together.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZnKPcznkNuT89B5ZLFcU9NxZB6GtZTA2uaQ58p4gvQv8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbqNNcExnf1vNqkq6YFMkqRaH2kAfkzaNorSE7UQgD1pQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZnKPcznkNuT89B5ZLFcU9NxZB6GtZTA2uaQ58p4gvQv8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
