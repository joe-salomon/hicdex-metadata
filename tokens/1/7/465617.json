It was a physical relief, like an instinct, a deep and compulsive need of conveying my feelings, of bringing out what was inside of my mind and body those days. \nThe shadowy atmosphere around the whole piece, along with the saturated and bright color of the main portrait, are trying to evoque the intoxicating feeling of distress inside my anguished heart during the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemia.
