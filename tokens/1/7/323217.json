We worked on it a bit, then prematurely took it on a road trip, with zero insulation and only the heat we ourselves could provide. \n\nIt was December and we drove from Minneapolis to Mesa. It was about 20 degrees when we left, but the coldest part of the trip was in New Mexico when it dropped to 17 overnight. \n\nWe slept on a queen sized beanbag stuffed with shards of memory foam. It was either totally comfortable or absolutely awful. \n\nI shot this on the way back, through a poorly applied layer of window tint, but it was a pretty kind filter. It lends a kind of postcard feel to the photo.
