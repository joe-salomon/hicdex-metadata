Then be a light in your own life and see how beautifully you shine.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSJeV75u3BTBtL3Kg2bjY8dRiqeWyL7pNvHXbqRib3ee5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUd75Vxk1hqnLcNdV5DvkXychetjX4MFsRGHvRDPrPCnc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSJeV75u3BTBtL3Kg2bjY8dRiqeWyL7pNvHXbqRib3ee5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TqncYX1VdcAmePRjnSXAFAmUMxo2iJf6g"], "tags": ["colorspectrum", "dimensions", "spectratraf", "lightandmaterials", "nftasia", "lightart", "light"], "extra": {}}
