The Vietnamese invasion was a continuation of the L\u00ea dynasty expansion, by which \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t had conquested the Champa kingdom in 1471. \nThe conflict grew into a wider conflagration involving the Ai-Lao people from Sip Song Chau Tai along with the Mekong river valley Tai peoples from the Yuan kingdom of Lan Na, L\u00fc kingdom Sip Song Pan Na (Sipsong Panna), to Muang along the upper Irawaddy river.\nThe conflict ultimately lasted approximately five years growing to threatened the southern border of Yunnan and raising the concerns of Ming China.\nEarly gunpowder weapons played a major role in the conflict, enabling \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t's aggression. Early success in the war allowed \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to capture the Lao capital of Luang Prabang and destroy the Muang Phuan city of Xiang Khouang. The war ended as a strategic victory for Lan Xang, as they were able to force the Vietnamese to withdraw with the assistance of Lan Na and Ming China.\nUltimately the war contributed to closer political and economic ties between Lan Na, Lan Xang, and Ming China. In particular, Lan Na's political and economic expansion led to a \"golden age\" for that kingdom.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWSrEoMQZMpAqKh9NU3UrQhuprM8eQ7LiJrCyXmhMeEKX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeknMKAWaWPeQN2uL21V8uiWVvTjVJ3MajXfieiVtpnHx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWSrEoMQZMpAqKh9NU3UrQhuprM8eQ7LiJrCyXmhMeEKX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2MxjL7SLCvEVmUtASGpa3tjNwnKfJXYaBu"], "tags": ["Laos", "Abstract", "2D", "Digitalart", "History"], "extra": {}}
