She was always a trouble-making kid and would get sent to the principal\u2019s office seemingly daily, she cared little for her academics and her grades suffered as a result, she brought home every undesirable type of boy from sleazy to violent. Her only talent was playing the bass \u2014 something her parents despised.\n\nAs her high school life went by, she felt increasingly unhappy with everything about it. She often felt depressed, lonely and miserable \u2014 but there wasn't anything worse than feeling unappreciated\u2026 and there was nobody there to appreciate her. She never had any real friends, she knew that all of the boys she brought home simply said they liked her music to try and get in her pants, a fact she was disgusted with.  It's also not like her family shared her love for rock music \u2014 since she was a kid, they had been telling her to find a \"real\" career path and stay in school, something she just couldn\u2019t seem to hold down. Roxanne knew what she had to do \u2014 she needed to take matters into her own hands!\n\nImmediately following that thought, she took to the internet and searched for any audition that she could find. An interesting one popped up: \"wanted, a bassist for a virtual idol band\". The idea of it was definitely an oddball one, but one that she knew she had to apply. She had never heard of this character, but the demo reel of the idol\u2019s music sounded exactly like the rock she had always wanted to play!\n\nRoxanne had the overwhelming feeling that she and this virtual idol were destined to play music together and be world-famous. The only thing that could calm her down was playing the bass, so she grabbed it and did a grand powerslide along the carpet to release some of her bubbling energy before heading out to pack for the audition. \"I'm gonna rock this!\u201d\n\n\u2014-\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied.
