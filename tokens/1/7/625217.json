{"__version": 1, "token_id": 625217, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Indestructible", "description": "Indestructible is the sixth studio album by the American punk rock band Rancid. It was produced by Brett Gurewitz (Bad Religion) and released by Hellcat Records with distribution through Warner Bros. Records on August 19, 2003. Despite critical acclaim, the band was criticized by some of its fans for Indestructible's \"poppier\" sound on some of its tracks. It debuted at number 15 on the charts, with 51,000 copies sold in its first week, making it Rancid's highest debut at the time though it would be surpassed six years later with their 2009 album, Let the Dominoes Fall. Indestructible marks the last recording by drummer Brett Reed, who left the band in 2006 and was replaced by current drummer Branden Steineckert (formerly of The Used). Additionally, it is the only album that features songwriting contributions from Reed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme3hopzxsN7raDjDUpvhRdrt72NUrxkL5TTQHzWDMYFDc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQJQVFLexKomny1CAgZkQYLQH4C3SkpvN6E7eFi6xrgyj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme3hopzxsN7raDjDUpvhRdrt72NUrxkL5TTQHzWDMYFDc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i9Jbej7sM2TvtpZ9YrJr8wUtpZ91BQ6vf"], "tags": ["digitalart", "pixelart", "8bit", "rancid", "album", "cover", "punk", "punkrock"], "extra": {}}
