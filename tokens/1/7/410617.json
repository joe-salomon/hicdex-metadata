The futuristic poster is fully rendered by Addyspacer. 3 of the works are minted on HEN, and 2 more on Pentas. The session was held on 9th October 2021 at 8.30 pm to 10.30 pm and hosted by five artists: FuturistsMY, Addyspacer, AzyanDraws, Imagishary and Lakarumbi. The hosts shared their thoughts on EMOTIONS and CONNECTIONS. Does one feel emotions when working on an art? Should emotions be allowed to flow freely? The artists also gave some insightful advice on inspirations towards an art. The recording of this session will be published on the Futurists\u2019 Spotify.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTA1BZKZGDn1DUz8snkh5GTZLk1aBQKXGKh4gd2yksdRW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmemhEootr8Q339vbfSnKW4WCPwxQESaQUBLwo1hAsEWwR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTA1BZKZGDn1DUz8snkh5GTZLk1aBQKXGKh4gd2yksdRW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QHYQ19QqY7pUUPWZMjBRpy8VmoH3Qq4zK"], "tags": ["Futurists", "sci-fi", "surreal", "black", "alien", "descent"], "extra": {}}
