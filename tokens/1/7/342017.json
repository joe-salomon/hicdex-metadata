But because of her ruthless nature, the people of Girah are afraid of Calon Arang, and so, Ratna Manggali had no suitors. Knowing this, Calon Arang became furious, holding all of the people in the village responsible.\n\nShe decided to place a curse on Girah, and performed a dark ceremony in the cemetery by offering the sacrifice of a young girl to the Goddess Durga. Durga came down and granted the request of Calon Arang and the curse came true. A flood engulfed the village and took many people's lives. Afterward, many of the survivors became very sick with an incurable plague and died.\n\nNateng Dirah \n4500x5000 \nRakaJana \n2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdzTtsKdayKV2fNr7dxt4j1Qo2Ff1x7uAXfVbPVUtA7ne", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTXGxzZbUJaCmbHD9MhaMvw4dhxkndjA4mArh6J5MfK5V", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdzTtsKdayKV2fNr7dxt4j1Qo2Ff1x7uAXfVbPVUtA7ne", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WyqapuXM2ieFydW1Q6g7DXPnbwAfZbw8D"], "tags": ["natengdirah", "bali", "rakajana", "illustrator"], "extra": {}}
