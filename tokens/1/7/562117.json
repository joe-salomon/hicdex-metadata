There\u2019ll be 12 artworks in total from 6 different continents.\n\nI started this series with Africa and I chose this tale as I felt that drawing a leopard would be so much interesting.\n\nThe tale was about a handsome stranger strolled around in a village mysteriously. His appearance grabbed people\u2019s eyes especially the maidens as they thought this young man was looking for a bride. But he always left the village without saying a word. Just disappeared into a forest.\n\nOne day, he came back to the village and one of the maidens really fell in love with him so decided to follow him back to the forest. As he realized he was being followed by the girl, he begged her to return home but she insisted to still follow. Turned out the handsome man was a savage leopard who was allowed to wander about in villages and towns like a man month once a month. Soon enough after he revealed his secret, he regained his natural form as a snarling leopard and chased the girl as if she's a prey.\n\nLuckily she managed to survive. The leopard, disappointed of its prey, went slunk back into the forest. The handsome stranger was never seen again.
