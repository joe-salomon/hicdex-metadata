That was a time I used to be very sad, and my way to get better was to stay in the bathtub long enough to write a poem, and this one came out. \n\nThe original language is Spanish, but I translated it if you'd like to read it in english:\n\nI want to\nbe cooked \nby this bathtub\nand wait for my skin\nto turn white,\nlike a chicken broth.\n\nI wish I was not so sad.\n\nWhen I\u2019m sad, \nI\u2019d like you\nto peel potatoes,\nthrow them \nin the bathtub,\nand leave \nthe salt aside\njust in case\nI don\u2019t produce\nenough flavor. \n\nTry me with \na teaspoon\nevery certain time\nbefore I lift the plug\nand it\u2019s too late\nto get it all back. \n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPw5sHPJ3v1qH8fH9bWz2J9Ymu7RQPKt4TsYmuTxyEhaQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQN1inrwbBeVzP9egck3juT6XxFwyE65YKb6gUxt9MAPD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPw5sHPJ3v1qH8fH9bWz2J9Ymu7RQPKt4TsYmuTxyEhaQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iXQpjWPaJUJxMPWYtYg6ec4EkyKCriQVg"], "tags": ["photography", "self-portrait", "poetry", "poem"], "extra": {}}
