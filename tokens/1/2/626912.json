She stood, at some points nose to nose, brow to brow with him. This was unorthodox for any woman of the tribe but she did not care. Such a fiercely benevolent soul she was, and she did not shy from confrontation. Her heart was broken but she allowed anger to be her channel. \nHe shouldn't be leaving.\nThe elders were working from fear and sending the young men away to defend a problem that was not theirs.\nBut Femi had no time for such discussion. Although he agreed deeply in every crevice of his being, he was a Warrior before he was a man. Emotion was pointless. \nThe day he had worked his whole life for had apparently arrived early.\nThis was his call.\nAisha will have to wait. Though she will likely marry another. A coward maybe?
