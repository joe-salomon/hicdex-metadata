{"__version": 1, "token_id": 372312, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Demonic Imp", "description": "Demonic Imp\nEntered via: Hidden rift #20210929\nPower level: Sub-Creeper\nSize: 2.5 feet/ 0.76 meters tall\nAspect: None\nSecondary Aspects: None\n\nDemonic Imps are the smallest demons the Order has ever seen exist in the Abyssal Void. They usually light their way with a small lantern of soulfire and arm themselves with crude spears of chipped stone. Although they have many eyes, they have poor eyesight and track movement when hunting.\n\nPhysically weak, easily startled and scared by any strong opposition, these minor demons are sub-Creeper level. They often are subjugated as slaves for the more powerful demons, who often corrupt them to their own aspect. Often, one can hide from or effectively ambush Demonic Imps by merely staying still, so these demons pose the smallest threat. \n\nRegardless, the Order has managed to create a small, semi-permanent portal that should allow for one legion of these small creatures to escape into our plane in order to create the basis of a workforce for the eventual rebuilding of the world.
