It is a small city with low buildings and many ancient buildings: churches, a fortress, a fortress wall, a tower. Many of these buildings have not been restored and look abandoned. The city simply has no money for restoration. But everything looks clean and tidy. We spent two days there. After the metropolis, it seemed to me the most wonderful place. We walked for a long time, it was cold, the children were rolling down the slides, people were walking along the frozen river. I took two shots, but the cassette was so frozen that it didn\u2019t fully develop, and the image remained dark blue despite the bright day.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQGuP1aFh4Ds7Rrjz5AJv6wX3zqWHoDhC5E1Rtutu4HUJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWdFkwYP7NoY3B4z3CyEfsHh7GVfTVxcREaTgKb6XL3Cp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQGuP1aFh4Ds7Rrjz5AJv6wX3zqWHoDhC5E1Rtutu4HUJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d5HE9dWCn6ciiSgLRvfegDiHyMUt6oo4w"], "tags": ["Polaroiddiary", "Pskov"], "extra": {}}
