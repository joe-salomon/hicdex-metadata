T828 on fire around 10:15 p.m. The building was engulfed in flames by 11 p.m. as firefighters worked to contain the blaze. By morning, there was nothing left but charred remains and embers. The suspected arsonist was never caught.\n\nI took my first photograph of historic Fort Barry Building T828 (also referred to as the Target House) on July 2, 2015, while I was an affiliate artist at Headlands Center for the Arts. What started as a modest photographic exploration, blossomed in to an unexpected meditation on image, place, memory, time, and ultimately, loss.\n\nThis project is ongoing.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZaecRuyfQP7LLPMtGq52nqZvTBwjrE4dxhW5kWnejW1Y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX9YQmbHm6D8KMCVRUdmGCc8TaXGqMj7nukXyMt97yot1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZaecRuyfQP7LLPMtGq52nqZvTBwjrE4dxhW5kWnejW1Y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PsY6huVzWihab1EX1Axrtk72ip9qQHBCs"], "tags": ["bwphotography", "nature", "digital", "color", "fire", "colorblocks", "red", "orange", "garyedwardblum"], "extra": {}}
