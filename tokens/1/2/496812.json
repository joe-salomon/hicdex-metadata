Yellow fire laces my way, burning like hellfire through you; her moves mirror my own confusion. The gray wind blows on empty air, it clings to everything, my only guide. Gray brass seethes in a fury, calling all the dead by name. Nothing speaks better than her skin, it stings and sings, and dances like a cantaloupe. Numbly she lies, she knows everything tumbles to a standstill.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUeXAKRb479TUUATxFtBijK1bthcCvJz5iBgpMLEe5xbT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXF16QXP5nhFRGKHw9WhcmHZSpUxCWYYjjcHg12qQ7KVj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUeXAKRb479TUUATxFtBijK1bthcCvJz5iBgpMLEe5xbT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1bchTMEsYtQLZCaRc713M5feyfxzPD87TM"], "tags": ["girl", "expressionism", "vqgan", "eroticism"], "extra": {}}
