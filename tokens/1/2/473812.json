This can be seen in most digital 3d systems when geometry is modeled or moved very far away from the origin of the 3d scene. This is otherwise known as the Far From Origin problem.\n\nThe anthropomorphic subject is chosen as a way to come to terms with our inherent bias towards our own morphology and the uncanny feelings experienced when this familiar form is manipulated. It is a form of subversion against this anthropomorphic bias. Subject was originally 3d scanned and post processed by me. The audio was derived from the stepping in the walk cycle. The audio and 3d model undergo similar manipulations. As they move farther from their origin, they can no longer be represented as continuous elements of shape and sound. The digital formats designed to represent them break down.\n\n10000 x 10000, jpg\n\n\u00a9 2021 Luis E. Fraguada.
