I think it was around this time someone on Instagram made some incendiary comments about my work and the validity of it, of which I am not repeating here. I'm used to being trolled on Instagram. Some people see someone writing just a few words and claiming it to be art get upset and feel that they have a certain level of entitlement to let me know that I'm not a REAL artist and a fraud. I normally ignore trolls like this, but it ate my ego. I took their hate and fueled this work from it. Is it pretentious? You bet. Was I pissed off? You bet. Do I give a shit? Absolutely not, in this case. After stewing over the comment, which has since been deleted because they were banned from the social media platform, my bruised ego encouraged me to be combative. I was like, \"I'm going to show them!\" And show them I did. This is a great example of using mind over violence to create a positive outcome.
