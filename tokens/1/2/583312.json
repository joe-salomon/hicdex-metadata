An extract of the Otoris coupling, Noden has the gift (or the curse) of knowing all timelines forward and back simultaneously.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this trait would collapse the mind of any not of the Otoris lineage, so Noden is doing extremely well to contain the possible madness. It helps in knowing the future timelines that she\u2019s aware she isn\u2019t driven insane; but also she knows of her fate \u2013 she knows she\u2019s going to be kidnapped and betrayed by one of her kin.\n\nUnfortunately it is at this point in her future that all else is hidden by temporal fog and she cannot see why. Knowing that this is to happen whilst also knowing that it can\u2019t be stopped because it has already happened can sometimes be a struggle for such a young mind.\n\nSo why is one so young such a major player? Because she\u2019s an Oracle; and Oracles are extremely rare.\n\nPNG 4800 x 4800 || December 12th 2021 || Dark Art digital painting \u2013 expanding the Gormenghast origin universe\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR7rSkVVEwPbhkG9EugLZ8EZG913hv2Goeexc98oCKJ2y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTD5rJesgsCiL17ABmKjmAaFFH5ZUJ8SovttM6NVzSjf9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmczez9ynfWEBmkQJygSzjmEknnoyLhQGPN8cE2LL8mSsg", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR7rSkVVEwPbhkG9EugLZ8EZG913hv2Goeexc98oCKJ2y", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NWtHHck4dxpwCSGVrboat83R9STyLfmfA"], "tags": ["darkartstudio", "gormenghast", "gothicart", "digitalpainting", "metaverse", "darkart", "nftart", "horror", "gothic", "evil", "stevemunro"], "extra": {}}
