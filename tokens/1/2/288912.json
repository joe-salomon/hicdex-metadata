Hybrid Mythologies is an ongoing project where elements, archetypes and inspiration from different mythologies, legends, stories, philosophies and own dreams are brought together in new formations. While there may be many differences in stories we tell, in cultures we belong to, in languages we speak and times we live in, there are universal elements and wisdoms about the human experience and existence that they often share. My attempt is to seek that connection and unification point and express it in an intuitive way through my own visual language.
