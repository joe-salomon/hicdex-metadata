It is important to note that \"home\" is not the same for everyone. A home, for me and other women is the bones of your father, the smell of your mother and the vanished childhood memories. Home with which earth for all humanity is not same for every human? Thinking about the possibility of a returning to a home you lost forever. To the ghosts, or old noises of blood, and graves. To the ground where you lost everything. Earth, in its big meaning of home, comes to part of women that want to raise their voice again, that want to be heard and that won\u2019t give up on life. This project's content will provide a lens to how humans are connected to the ground they were born on and how that connect symbolically to the meaning of future.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdWRv7GDjXYqYCggdhPn5jNS75GKCAqUcBj3qV8GRbPVM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdLPY8HtQcXATEBf9P84FpF5NAgBoa64G2McYqy2GVHDJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdWRv7GDjXYqYCggdhPn5jNS75GKCAqUcBj3qV8GRbPVM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MYij9zrKjzVNWbNWkpnEMybL4WDsLrfdm"], "tags": ["image"], "extra": {}}
