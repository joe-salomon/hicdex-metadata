The shamanic jaguar spirit made its presence felt so strongly as if it was communicating beyond language. Ethereal! Upon coming into this waking state, there was more clarity.. I felt a strong intuition that there was a deep connection of the forest spirit and the shamans of ancient south east asia and the jaguar spirit was trying to show me their intertwined connection and express that these multi dimensional beings who manifest in our reality are beautiful bridges of love and unity among all. Music created using generative processing and explorations. The soundscape was created using various sounds and frequencies of the forest, and shamanic rituals.
