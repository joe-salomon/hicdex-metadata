{"__version": 1, "token_id": 522812, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OLD SHOULDER BECOME COLD SHOULDERS", "description": "In Kevin Ayers' incredible song \"Cold Shoulder\", we can extrapolate the entire meaning of the song from just these 5 words: OLD SHOULDERS BECOME COLD SHOULDERS. This was one of the songs from his very last album. He passed away in 2013 after living a famously tumultuous life, but his succinct words about aging and facing death are some of the best I've ever seen. We can break down his words and find out what they could mean. OLD SHOULDERS (the concept of aging) BECOME COLD SHOULDERS (the act of dying) and as we get older our bodies breakdown and eventually we die. To poignantly say this with with the bare minimum of words...and rhyme is just amazing to see, read, feel and hear. If you've never heard of or listened to the songs of Kevin Ayers, I strongly suggest a listen or two.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZt6TEwurdjSFUFebizAqcbkETQXG5TBv6xt5ZoR4Mn2b", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfU1uEDAit5QpJP3FeYX5t7SpeS3ajQGBo562nXGQ4CiN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZt6TEwurdjSFUFebizAqcbkETQXG5TBv6xt5ZoR4Mn2b", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
