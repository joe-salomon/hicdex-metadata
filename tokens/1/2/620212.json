{"__version": 1, "token_id": 620212, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "EMPTY", "description": "EMPTY is an incredibly special word. When you remove certain letters at a time and phonetically read out the words, it still says the word EMPTY. Try it, you'll see. Sound out each line beneath the word EMPTY, but only read the purplish/lavender color letters. So not only does the word keep saying EMPTY on each line, but the meaning of the words become incredibly meta as the artwork becomes devoid of purple letters and thus becoming empty of EMPTY letters. It kind of messes with your mind a little bit. I can't wait to do many paintings, prints, and sculptures with this one. I keep coming back to this one like a well of inspiration; I drink it in.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS6SaYkxkZ8dtgebJrkV3nSpM4iTRb9i9e6ym1j8VT9UG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVyADvA1fWbNMfutyLdpduNA7dWuEm1gJdcSrkZAfZgud", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS6SaYkxkZ8dtgebJrkV3nSpM4iTRb9i9e6ym1j8VT9UG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
