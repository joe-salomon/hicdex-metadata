The poster was drawn by artist Amira. The session was held on 2nd October 2021 at 8.30 pm to 10.30 pm and hosted by five artists: FuturistsMY, Shosabishi, Seetizens, Amiwabisabi and NFTnostalgic. The hosts shared their thoughts on how to create value in NFTs, apart from the art itself. They also discussed about the possible applications of NFTs and how hype plays a vital role in marketing. There were about 60-65 attendees. The recording of this session will be published on the Futurists\u2019 Spotify.
