Like their celestial spirit animal, the scorpion, Scorpios lie in wait and strike when least expected. Life is a game of chess for these calculating water signs, who are constantly plotting several steps ahead in order to orchestrate an eventual checkmate. This doesn't mean their intentions are necessarily nefarious. Scorpios simply know what they want and aren't afraid to work hard and play the long game to get it.\n\nWater Sign", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcSeUuuAEwrJApPmxSqiQ3C6sDc1bchjckmTDnf2JgmS2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUEKYdZX1hzxYB4JmBJXd2Jn4EUWgpYLGXmjsFpzJWFz2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcSeUuuAEwrJApPmxSqiQ3C6sDc1bchjckmTDnf2JgmS2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1S3J7kuYFho5QyhZ7czyDmoR8sU1nvGzMM"], "tags": ["mystyx", "scorpio", "signs", "mystic", "pabloslenders", "starsigns"], "extra": {}}
