According to officials at the Institute for Chronosensitivity, the process, brought about by mere circumstance, managed to produce Christmas twice in rapid succession using a spacetime editing machine, which was then monitored by a computer for scientific analysis. This discovery has caused an uproar in the scientific community, and institutions around the world are now clambering to be the first to reproduce this Christmas miracle. The Director of the Institute for Chronosensitivity released a statement this afternoon: \n\n\"The Institute for Chronosensitivity was created with the goal of studying the relationship between spacetime and western cultural identity, and this remarkable discovery both demonstrates the value of this work and brings us closer to our dream of finally creating a consistent theory of western identity and culture. With continued support, we will be able to make further breakthroughs and perhaps one day our children or grandchildren will be able to experience Christmas Day everyday.\"\n\nFor continued coverage of this event and more, be sure to follow Chronosensitivity on Twitter at https://twitter.com/chronosensitive", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbQCsjVkKskTqpEecS6WBVKAZ5HdcDa9oTgTnPdfiWWRF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbQCsjVkKskTqpEecS6WBVKAZ5HdcDa9oTgTnPdfiWWRF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbQCsjVkKskTqpEecS6WBVKAZ5HdcDa9oTgTnPdfiWWRF", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VZrkBPdGjdS1mBHnr6Msu61GszRMGXFYf"], "tags": ["Video", "VideoArt", "NarrativeArt", "Christmas", "Analog", "AnalogVideo", "VideoSynthesis", "AbstractArt", "Glitch", "VideoGlitch"], "extra": {}}
