I've been wanting to make a more post apocalyptic, outdoors, natural scene for the longest time. So I saw this as a golden opportunity to just go for it. I was inspired by this amazing concept by Daniel Percy. But I still tried to give it my own little twist. I wanted it to feel slightly more hopeful and peaceful.\nThe focus of this project was mood and lighting, and focusing on - and perfecting a singular shot all in a very limited amount of time. This allowed me to work with the megascans library, and a bunch of other free asset packs that I found on the epic games store. For the house I frankenstein-ed a bunch of megascans, with some of my own geometry and other assets I found online. To finish it off though , I created the red wood siding material in Substance Designer.\nI hope you enjoy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRuhvkY9tkv8fjarLMANKgTonX1aM6ic3rxcJb8tcdNDs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYbtssUdgVQBZtyntFLZ6Y1V2nDpwBsXqWVjL6setZapE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRuhvkY9tkv8fjarLMANKgTonX1aM6ic3rxcJb8tcdNDs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e4kxCf7UXR1UvKib4zPESfsdfPShwgNir"], "tags": ["LostandFound"], "extra": {}}
