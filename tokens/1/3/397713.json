Each pixel that is not the background color, #00000A in this piece, represents a unique address that participated in these transactions.\n\nFor the first frame of the GIF, the pixels are colored based on how many transactions they participated in during the chosen day. A more active address is shown as a brighter star. Thereafter, randomly chosen pixels have their brightness altered to create the twinkling effect.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQA7w6bKYjqBryRQqTHgZc9gLRTNXSbw2bWCjogZZLDH5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQA7w6bKYjqBryRQqTHgZc9gLRTNXSbw2bWCjogZZLDH5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQA7w6bKYjqBryRQqTHgZc9gLRTNXSbw2bWCjogZZLDH5", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ivKe6mnAgmKhzqjvvtSyxT8BfDv9niVna"], "tags": ["generative", "art", "pixelart", "pixel", "digital", "blockchain", "tezos", "dataasart", "star", "starry", "night"], "extra": {}}
