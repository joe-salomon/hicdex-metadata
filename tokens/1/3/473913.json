The reasons for their disappearance are very diverse and depend on each species.\n \nThe horsenny was a peaceful and tame animal that inhabited the Morondanga regions.\nIts total and complete disappearance from the face of the earth was due to the introduction of the ghost cheetah, its main predator, by King Filomenus*, whose sanity had succumbed after a Night of the Frogs** event.\n\nThe King's last years were confused, and the one who ruled the country was not himself but his total and complete insanity. That is why the people could not judge him when he began to raise cheetahs in his garden and feed them with the last remaining horsennys on the planet.\n\nMany people choose the horsenny costume to attend the summer carnival***, as they say it brings luck. Others are not so sure.\n\n* See OBJTK #439879\n** See OBJKT #245972\n*** See OBJKT #220679", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZpBQeY3J1SYCv36K8RMivpeyUQ9BrTJrreUauKipeq28", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbLKty5XHQfXjdfQi6rMLUFsHKPbDMdsxfNdy8HVaLYtQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZpBQeY3J1SYCv36K8RMivpeyUQ9BrTJrreUauKipeq28", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Stamp", "Carnival", "Costume"], "extra": {}}
