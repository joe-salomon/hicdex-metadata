It could make someone else\u2019s day, it could empower us, it could be a way to navigate through difficult times, it could also be a thing to start your day and week.\n\nIn this Reason to Smile, I would love to bring the smiles people showed me when I travelled to Lombok, Thai and India. This also a reminder that in order to get someone\u2019s smile, we need to be able to create a safe space where everyone feels dafe to express and be themselves. So be it, let your Monday be full of smiles and let you be someone\u2019s reason to smile.\n\nLooping Mp4 without sound.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVNAJSoTAzGfr126f2NZuJHDy5Zv68jiH53vH8ch5Exiz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWS4cG2niZCVPgYbq2xnqyunsg75TFRDQwbTrm3cxDKVQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVNAJSoTAzGfr126f2NZuJHDy5Zv68jiH53vH8ch5Exiz", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz2JB6ZweygFSyBGAGzaHL83376oDX3Ntk6N"], "tags": ["ItsMondayArt", "Smile", "NFTPhotography", "NFTPhoto", "NFTCollector", "India", "Thailand", "Indonesia"], "extra": {}}
