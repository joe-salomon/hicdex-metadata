{"__version": 1, "token_id": 454713, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Golden snub-nosed", "description": "Golden snub-nosed\nThe head length of the gold stump noses varies from 48 to 68 centimetres, the tail is as long as the body or longer. Males are larger than females and also become significantly heavier: females weigh on average about 11 to 12 kilograms, while males can reach 18 to 20 kilograms. Depending on the season and habitat, however, significant weight fluctuations are possible.\n\nThe trunk and limbs of these monkeys are reddish-yellow, with colouring ranging from brownish to light orange. Back and tail are dark brown, a stripe on the head and shoulders are black. The coat of these animals is relatively long with 5 to 8 centimetres for primates, in males a mane-like, golden-yellow hair on the back grows with age, whereby the hair can be up to half a metre long. The muzzle is white and hairless, the region around the eyes is light blue. Like all stump noses, they are characterized by a short nose, the openings of which are directed towards the front. In the corners of the mouth, wart-like outgrowths grow in adult males. These outgrowths do not otherwise occur in any primate species; their function is unknown.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTue4kHjhkFaFg5d7sqsb6LMvnhsBfuzN8Lz8edpDa9tU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSaAc66dNerm8UYfw5La3m99Kc5jSkvsBA6pwrDtomHbN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTue4kHjhkFaFg5d7sqsb6LMvnhsBfuzN8Lz8edpDa9tU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cYeLzaQ5mPLdJGj4CRdZbWJheFcDtZRtc"], "tags": ["ape", "monkey", "drawing", ""], "extra": {}}
