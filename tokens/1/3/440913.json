{"__version": 1, "token_id": 440913, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Save Him (\"Red hem\")", "description": "Auction #1 - 005\nArtist: Cobalus (Andreas Valkenborgh) - www.cobalus.xyz \nSeries: Abstracts\nYear: 2016\nSize: 140cm x100 cm (55,1in x 39,4in)\n\nCobalus' collection Abstracts is a diverse series of paintings with geometric shapes and a color palette that often has a 70's feel to it. Some of these paintings are - however - remarkably different and don't entirely fit that box. 'Save him' is a perfect example. This particular painting marks the end of the Abstracts collection and the beginning of the Floralia series. 'Save him' testifies to the crushing uncertainty one experiences when health issues cast a shadow over one's existence. \n\nEXTRA: The first owner of this NFT will receive 1 WIP-NFT (Work-in-Progress) to add more value and authenticity to their purchase/investment. https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/440887  \n\nDISCLAIMER: Authentic Cobalus NFT's grant you full ownership of the digital & physical artwork.
