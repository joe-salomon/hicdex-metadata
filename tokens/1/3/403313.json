He was described as a god of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. Saturn's mythological reign was depicted as a Golden Age of plenty and peace. After the Roman conquest of Greece, he was conflated with the Greek Titan Cronus. Saturn's consort was his sister Ops, with whom he fathered Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres and Vesta.\n\nSaturn was especially celebrated during the festival of Saturnalia each December, perhaps the most famous of the Roman festivals, a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. The Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum housed the state treasury and archives (aerarium) of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. The planet Saturn and the day of the week Saturday are both named after and were associated with him.\n\n(c) Wikipedia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVUwHYuokoVci17tHkg99kpVviAYuc9FrCscNe6FHPZQw", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdf9bNogTn86sBdnFAfDYzdNg9WaVnNeFmYvwhziBSvKh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVUwHYuokoVci17tHkg99kpVviAYuc9FrCscNe6FHPZQw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L8RSMjxuEupFEscUk1UYJ9iFktojwvJTJ"], "tags": ["saturn", "god", "vitality", "wealth", "liberation", "seeds", "harvest", "oil", "canvas", "oiloncanvas", "ancient", "suprematism"], "extra": {}}
