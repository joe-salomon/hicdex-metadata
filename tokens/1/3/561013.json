This piece is a drawing+ collage\nThe visualized piece is part of a series of drawings made during the mandatory quarantine phase 1 of the COVID-19 virus pandemic. During that period I found it impossible to travel and see family, friends and relatives, so I used google street view to walk the streets of my neighborhood and my hometown. I wanted to go further and went to Japan. I started to travel around Japan, rural areas, mountains, until I reached the center of Tokyo. And while I was drawing I was thinking if this virtual reality would become memories?\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWAPngne4L2S9SwvZDDaCkMfGsuq7ZtsTjvgeYDaHtnAN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPJvGrZhL8a24hjT1N5tAvMripoSHqGUusGJqm9525ABb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWAPngne4L2S9SwvZDDaCkMfGsuq7ZtsTjvgeYDaHtnAN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DuELouPpeB6VrtNiJ1cz428Y7ipX678bL"], "tags": ["shizuoka", "japan", "ink", "illustration", "handmade", "collage"], "extra": {}}
