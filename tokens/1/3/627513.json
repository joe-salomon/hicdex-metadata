The streets are full of snow and ice, darkness and mud are everywhere. This is my home and many of my friends are here, but I felt that I did not want to come here in winter or live here. I still admire the beauty of this city, its chaos, but I felt abandoned, and I hope that next time in the spring or summer it will pass. There was a broken tiger chair in the yard near the dump. It smiled at me, and I went back to it to take this picture.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPJSe6uXJTQsrnM5KdfXgTxfar9YaLvbkb5DnkgVyjvdv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYj4pmerjA2XVzFhDUcVfnHmeZXB5uPQ5ebPHQeU3H9T2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPJSe6uXJTQsrnM5KdfXgTxfar9YaLvbkb5DnkgVyjvdv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d5HE9dWCn6ciiSgLRvfegDiHyMUt6oo4w"], "tags": ["Polaroiddiary"], "extra": {}}
