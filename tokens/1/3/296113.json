All the pictures show women in the best versions of themselves. The woman, like the red color for me, conveys sexuality, beauty and power. And the crimson color goes hand in hand with the woman. Every job has its meaning, but I suggest you find something in common in each peace.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt the sexual energy of a stranger, you\u2019ll feel that energy through the photo. Through this work, I express my disgust with men who think sexy girls are lecherous. Behind long legs and beautiful butts are often intelligent and posh women. Behind judgments often turn out to be cheap, aggressive and stupid men. A woman is beautiful. A woman is strong. A woman is a surprise.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeig4v47sjmnbekmfmgh4sd36vbk7zs2sbmvcx5b26tosuqdvjz54we", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiglcpwb6sj725bdhytye3nnd5vkpuzete2qddilt7sv4prucnzchm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeig4v47sjmnbekmfmgh4sd36vbk7zs2sbmvcx5b26tosuqdvjz54we", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["redunion", "sexuality", ""], "extra": {}}
