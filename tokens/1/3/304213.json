You can use music to alter your vibrations into the feeling that you're trying to replicate - that feeling of contentment and peace you get from your favorite song? It's powerful. Tap into it, there is a reason that music is a universal language.\n\nAnd let's talk about the word emotion; do you know it's a derivate of energy in motion? All feelings are valid, and vibrationally charged. Some have high vibrations, and some have low vibrations.\n\nTake a moment, and attach feelings to your intentions. How would it feel to have achieved your intention? Really sit and think about how it will feel when those intentions come to fruition. Got it? Cool. Now go get it!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPWfJh9w9w66Zg7uGTHpVcbekLFjUApXTFQyAaF5zMCGT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPXv4HfvQxu1D5P42KLoxq5AFqWcBgT2oQjXuvbK8CDCH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPWfJh9w9w66Zg7uGTHpVcbekLFjUApXTFQyAaF5zMCGT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cGbod6dv2DeMzaSHadZJHL6SaPNVZK4RS"], "tags": ["emotion", "photography", "blackandwhite", "manifestation", "hailtree", "feelings", "energy", "symmetry"], "extra": {}}
