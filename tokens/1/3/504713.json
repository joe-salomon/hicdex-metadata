The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: Semi-automatic, the Glock 17 is handed to me by a man in a dark suit. He tells me it\u2019s for me. Well, maybe not for me. The Glock is too big for me. The hammer is made of too many pieces of metal, and is mostly made of pure alpha and the sub-atomic particles zeros and ones. I hold the gun upside down, and place it right next to my Omics, which are transparent and burn when hit by high voltage. The Omics fire a laser beam that causes me a fraction of a second of pain. The laser light strikes the bottom of the hammer and sparks fly. This all takes place in slow motion. Then all of a sudden I am in a war, in which a group of high ranking military men are being pursued by several individuals who appear to be ninjas. The individuals who appear to be ninjas fly down from the sky and quickly begin to shoot at the pursuing soldiers. \n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 64 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNezyizL95Jh2BeR97p5RdgLWoYkhknbaBoxTP8kDUL5E", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdCTfDAkqqAdKCqBfr3q78AReQUDKQykMmjif32S7iNY1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNezyizL95Jh2BeR97p5RdgLWoYkhknbaBoxTP8kDUL5E", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["HEN500K", "halfmilly", "gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare", "generative", "generativetext", "poetry"], "extra": {}}
