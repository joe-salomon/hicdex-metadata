{"__version": 1, "token_id": 519213, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SOMETIMES I GET CARRIED AWAY", "description": "SOMETIMES I GET CARRIED AWAY visually explores the mental, physical and spiritual experience of being under the influence of cannabis edibles and going on a vision quest. It illustrates the moment when the effects of THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive chemical of the cannabis plant.) kick in and the journey begins. What is a vision quest? It is a duration of spiritual seeking among certain Native American peoples, that typically involves isolation, fasting, and the inducement of a trance state for the purpose of attaining guidance or knowledge from supernatural forces. What happens on this journey? Sometimes amazing visions occur that lend perspective on something specific in your life. Sometimes visual abstractions occur with regards to colors/shapes/duration of time/smell/taste/etc. Sometimes nothing happens at all, it all depends on different factors: 1. Dosage (I never take more than 20mg THC, which is relatively low, but powerful enough to illicit a palpable vision quest.) 2. Settings (depending on where you have your journey, it can hinder or help). 3. Stress level (mental, physical or emotional tension) ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYtG1n8D5Cb5qmMVWDtzukMcHyAtSZ6qJfBL8R9iiHe5i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRuUpaPe8FWZd4zqiwRUp5NTjDMRpqWNAumo6p7uMmPha", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYtG1n8D5Cb5qmMVWDtzukMcHyAtSZ6qJfBL8R9iiHe5i", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
