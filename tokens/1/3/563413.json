I was silent by the question, I can't answer it right now but I believe we are created by time. Time just is like air, we breathe the same air and we age at the same moment.\n\non our way, we will learn many things, meet new people, but if you are lucky you will meet your soul mate and share the same space & time.\n\nTime is a very precious gift from God to us. With that, I will pass the precious little time I have for my children & family.\n\nSubmission for #AMJO2 #NFTPrizedMoments.\nPixelart 200x250px resize to 1000x1500 px\nFrame by Frame animation (215 frames in total)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRfJaHwLkUUHhyw1SYv9NGxK4UcDpT5tVunXTawgx4cJT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmejAVhmU7tYvLgzcPo2pQP8dJTGFmQnavtSyr9iXRckXV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmcTRYZkKzCX4KywPFUAFf8wFTpkDav6LLhBAPPTXhQ5cu", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRfJaHwLkUUHhyw1SYv9NGxK4UcDpT5tVunXTawgx4cJT", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2XHrDqeyAhyimtMKQrx4QmacN71oMfYQdz"], "tags": ["AMJO2", "Time", "Pixelart", "Pixelanimation", "Love"], "extra": {}}
