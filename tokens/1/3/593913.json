In Between series contemplates any moment that could be considered as an \"in-between\" situation. Like life and death, start and stop, sound and silence, earth and sky, what is said and what is written, physical and metaphysical, aural and visual, the transient of sounds, the transition between confusions and resolutions, the overwhelming sensations before deciding to choose difficult choices. All of these things are some examples of what we often face in everyday life, that is sometimes rare to think about deeply.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZvfRcrZfkGMkBQBE9CzNTLBg3kG9jSkiyfa4mbRj7SRd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeqrTbLtSvKf4Eo4aTWNJLkzgzMcEc7UxUTKFGzxEpA2u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmTNUDxtTD5fsb6Nx5AABWHJEz2m8tFxzg7dgvy3PFSXns", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZvfRcrZfkGMkBQBE9CzNTLBg3kG9jSkiyfa4mbRj7SRd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1f5b3SKY2RnVKv7owkKTiNKrTKS6CaQ4vi"], "tags": ["digital", "audiovisual", "morsecode", "video", "interactive", "newmediaart", "contemplation", "videoart", "soundart", "barcode"], "extra": {}}
