This part of desert is a bit colder because of the mountains that surrounds it, therefore you can see a lot of gardens and greens  unlike the other cities in desert.\nThe vulture mounts are the most famous mountains near Natanz, with peaks higher than 3500 m , they look so tall although they are not that close to us.\nIn persian, these mounts are called Karkas, which translates to vulture. They say it's been named Karkas because the peak was so high, even vultures wouldn't fly there. \n---\n35mm black and white photography", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeRRYKneappARknpzBzMrGHXwGYxmduBsa4KGtLTdoWR9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYPD4xho5EhPpUYPxe5bKVSu41EVXvE3TwzjXPpTTapsH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeRRYKneappARknpzBzMrGHXwGYxmduBsa4KGtLTdoWR9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Analog", "Photo", "mountains", "nature", "Filmphotography", "Photography", "35mm", "BW", ""], "extra": {}}
