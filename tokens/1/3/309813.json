Both the visuals and the audio are created with custom software (JavaScript, C++, and MaxMSP). Conceptually and technically an evolution of my \"Simple Harmonic Motion\" series (which started in 2011).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZUxHugn6UQU8sbCnAw6UN4sHuNgD4RLxyqQbRYgZAKXt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUvHSP2KH64i2Ympqsn1syR5vaaWBwUBL1Sd6vJPq62KB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZUxHugn6UQU8sbCnAw6UN4sHuNgD4RLxyqQbRYgZAKXt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Z1pDsbfuF7t6fHfbVxhjhouRemXuREpH5"], "tags": ["complexharmonicmotion", "video", "audiovisual", "abstract", "memotv", "threejs", "memoakten", "animation", "javascript", "generativeart", "sound", "generative"], "extra": {}}
