We see some eyes scattered throughout the image considering that we are always being watched, by cameras throughout the city, whether by computers and cell phones, or even by beings who are not incarnated. We are faced again with the creation from a seed that resembles a vagina, from which the fluid of life is born, giving rise to a pine cone, pine, pine or pineal, generating the connection with the planetary energy field and generating a baby, who does it have its umbilical cord connected to the cosmos, does this bird and this child meditating have to do with this line of reasoning, how light is the created being being all the time observed and judged with eyes everywhere?\n\nYear: 2018 | Technique: Black pen on paper\n\nThis artwork is from a limited edition of 10 prints\nPrinted in UltraChrome HD mineral pigment - Epson\n297x420 mm Hahnem\u00fchle Museum Etching 350g\nWagner Possati - Brazil - S\u00e3o Paulo 2020\n\n3508x4961pixels | .jpg | 96dpi | 11.9 MB\n\nThis art is part of a collection of 4 works released by Galeria Visionariom Art.\nThis NFT was generated as a gift from a physical work.\nwww.visionariom.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZoHBWzP5QU7BgUkU9x9Dot2JbpMhxCdPCkQ2KetT6mvp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYZJUVG98jCdrqCiXXZ11Y5ynrLtiLBpXUnZUXZtDapG5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZoHBWzP5QU7BgUkU9x9Dot2JbpMhxCdPCkQ2KetT6mvp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RbevQhPbo6mfBW9mrmNZzju5hHrpaG5QP"], "tags": ["wagnerroza", "obrjkt", "elephant", "visionariom", "visionariomgallery", "brazil"], "extra": {}}
