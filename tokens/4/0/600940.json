The original now hangs framed in her office. She is a woman of tenacious persistence, and a mind that keeps tracks of every moving piece at once. A master people-reader, she is light and dark at the same time, nuanced and heavy handed with an excellent sense of humor. She's worked through some of life's most difficult situations, and always comes out of the other side more unique and more capable because of it. If you own this collage, her strength will channel through this to you (no gas fees required)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVsu4AZyBXtYbqPf3KWEZuzxDoTzb6EaULzLRcHEZ6Hxs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmStVNHubaCLfLub6bi7Yb26WxSA2F6rc8ERmRV34P2RuQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVsu4AZyBXtYbqPf3KWEZuzxDoTzb6EaULzLRcHEZ6Hxs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VmZyzx1mMvhNtP7yWVcGr2Q5qJ3ghqeZB"], "tags": ["collage", "handmade", "digital", "igettiredofwritingthesetagszzz"], "extra": {}}
