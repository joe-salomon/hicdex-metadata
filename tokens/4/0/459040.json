Laser cut stencils were used to decorate the piece with traditional islamic patterns (that's part of a long research I have on ethnomathematics and patterns throughout history). Face recognition algorithms and face mesh custom animation were added to a photo of the piece to bring it to life in the metaverse. This is one of the first sci-fi ceramics I've created. Part of long term project on future humanoids wondering about archeological discoveries on the little they know about Earth.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaaxi4XuCUzyrzk8i7bGe7jpnmp36KgskyWYTMp7Wp91K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmURUTCspHHR9ZbhHoPEwcRqxmKRzzXnzKujpj2cmGAMLM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaaxi4XuCUzyrzk8i7bGe7jpnmp36KgskyWYTMp7Wp91K", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gmZEeuAXQptBesNdemjjmy6nKeM3tyEC8"], "tags": ["sci-fi", "ceramics", "aiart", "neuralart", "facemesh", "3danimation"], "extra": {}}
