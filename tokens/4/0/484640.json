The out-of-body intense psychological and behavioral effects of low doses of phencyclidine led to its abuse. In the late 1960s and 1970s, phencyclidine became a widely used hallucinogenic drug. The effects were often extreme, marked by acute psychosis and aggressive and violent behaviors, and overdoses led to many emergency rooms visits and deaths from status epilepticus, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and subsequent renal, respiratory and hepatic failure.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmecdTdEizb8oko9Gtjv9XzdEEH5iQAFXi2Rws3rxZiv2U", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmecdTdEizb8oko9Gtjv9XzdEEH5iQAFXi2Rws3rxZiv2U", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmecdTdEizb8oko9Gtjv9XzdEEH5iQAFXi2Rws3rxZiv2U", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "PCP", "NFT", "collectible"], "extra": {}}
