Please Stand By, Karma is coming for R Kelly.  This week R Kelly was found guilty of 9 counts of sex trafficking and racketeering in a case that was 30 years in the making. For 3 decades R Kelly has been accused of abusing women, and for 3 decades it was an out in the open secret. Comedians made jokes about it, stories were published on it, and most recently the documentary \u201cSurviving R Kelly,\u201d went in depth into all of the various allegations against the R & B singer. \nR Kelly is currently awaiting sentencing which can see him serving anywhere between 10 years and life in prison, and while this is a win for many victims, how many women could have been saved if this issue had been addressed earlier. If we had believed all of the victims that came out in the past. It\u2019s time for us to start holding all men accountable, regardless of status and title and do better as a society. Only then can we help protect one another.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNZuyajn2WHVqSWxMPMcELuc7RkyGP3HzmzUW7xgkVqRL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUUSxYDFGZDAEXqaoZ3FaPYo9rExqw6rAkwULg8SjHBpk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNZuyajn2WHVqSWxMPMcELuc7RkyGP3HzmzUW7xgkVqRL", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
