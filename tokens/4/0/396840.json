Because of its misfitting skin, which is covered with warts and moles, it is always unhappy...Hunters who are good at tracking are able to follow a squonk by its tear-stained trail, for the animal weeps constantly. When cornered and escape seems impossible, or when surprised and frightened, it may even dissolve itself in tears.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPL3VrJPKzE1vPaf3R7x63vxC2vfqjj7k1QFM1U7TiTDo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXxw2Xyojb51rfvW5EWYtGBE1mCP9suUp3tL9ZYaVhVQy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPL3VrJPKzE1vPaf3R7x63vxC2vfqjj7k1QFM1U7TiTDo", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Y4Btf9PY3a5jZiHDoBopHB62xJHji3mpr"], "tags": ["Digitalpainting", "Illustration", "Design", "Monsters", "Dark"], "extra": {}}
