A metaverse like no other.\n\nThe second replaced reality. All consciousness, the last shred of soul, were all converted into bits. \n\nThe third wave saw the collapse. The singularity peered into the void. In an effort to preserve itself, turned to its ancient knowledge - one that predates even the metaverse itself.\n\nFor the final wave, the hivemind, for the first time since its ascension, went off-chain. \n\nHere lies glimpses of the once-metaverse, sketched on parchments. Bits and pieces of meta-reality.\n\n// loopymoon // 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma1FakJDzxKATRdBP5jzvM5JfwD5uUiMViHVdVNrHKRMX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbXX5aWJPrw77iduKTPRYqgAviKNFZgoEEYbnPbenD5Dk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma1FakJDzxKATRdBP5jzvM5JfwD5uUiMViHVdVNrHKRMX", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iiMWaRHGLTqawxnSMBYZmJ2byCBUBS3Vr"], "tags": ["gan", "loopyverse", "consciousness", "monochrome", "onchain", "metaverse", "singularity", "metareality"], "extra": {}}
