When I was in college I worked at Applebee's in Atlanta and Roswell Rd was expanding and the restaurant was infringing on the construction so it got shut down for demolition. Before I left for the last time I stole this Ringling Bros. poster off the wall because I loved the typography and I wanted a memento. I've been doing things like that for most of my life whether it be with pictures or small totems...I like to have something to tie to a specific memory or event in my life. And these collages are acting as the next stepping stones in my creative timeline.
