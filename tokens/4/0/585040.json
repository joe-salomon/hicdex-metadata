Thanks to a program specially designed for this project, the images are entered into a \"save-as\" control loop that produces a series of images that are 1% more compressed with each cycle. 100 iterations are enough to compress the image to 100%. 100 images thus gathered in an animated gif file, shows in accelerated the successive degradation of the images.\nThe view of accelerated degradation of the image intended for digital platforms collides with the prospect of a natural landscape that is also threatened and in a phase of accelerated degradation.\nThe degradation reaches a peak where the image takes on graphic quality and shimmering color.  A fine art print of the image in this changeover phase can be added to order through my website or twitter.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVGBAZ2hWgG7cTJWYbZuWeqbnThrQvP2H2FrLN8K42xJB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVGBAZ2hWgG7cTJWYbZuWeqbnThrQvP2H2FrLN8K42xJB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVGBAZ2hWgG7cTJWYbZuWeqbnThrQvP2H2FrLN8K42xJB", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1XgsUeHvYvTvZdxZnuBRxkGd5SYZFUKXdA"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
