When I was a boy, they would drive me up to the ash pit under cloudy skies. I would daydream about fall in Zion National Park even though I'd never been there, seen a single photo, nor heard anyone describe it. I envisioned it as a dazzling spectrum of soot; not unlike the remnants of burned refuse and yard waste consumed by the monochrome flames of the pit. \n\nOn my fifteenth birthday I had a vivid dream where hundreds of elephants wearing suits of armor were making chains out of duct tape. When I awoke, I shed a single colorless tear realizing I could never become an electrician. I was then uncontrollably compelled to ride my unicycle for six straight days through the battleship gray concrete storm drain tunnel system of my burgh and ate gainsboroberry muffins in total darkness. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSzFcNDzhANUc1XTeZAMjNmU2Z4PSxTwa5EfUh9EAoNJw", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb6eqvcgWnnhZjY8eWaG5GX7j8U5pVn2Qb1Cn176CYc3w", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSzFcNDzhANUc1XTeZAMjNmU2Z4PSxTwa5EfUh9EAoNJw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PD1nEMmWSi6jXYswGBX9LoEeP7ZtLPhKL"], "tags": ["#wailing", "#extrafineart", "#Exodus", "#Russell", "#hand", "#chesthair", "#gray", "#achromatopsia#graywail"], "extra": {}}
