Politicians love power and control over everthing and everyone including general public. Politicians rarely admit mistakes they make and often say things that sound good (to gain vote bank), independent of honesty and truth. Some even have no problem in misleading people. Politician's allegiance is to the ones who has the money and thus they act in their own best interest. Such politicians play on people's emotions and perceptions, independent of facts and reasons. Public must seek to build and support thoughtful leaders and not the plain emotionless politicians.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRZoQtjRdPobGXLPAXffm3uBzVj8KdE4K4xULF4agrDFx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfWgQucUSkeoyhg2YH3RYsmbFPTR7NwgqKhAXpuaZ9AY7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRZoQtjRdPobGXLPAXffm3uBzVj8KdE4K4xULF4agrDFx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eEwKgY5oaMnpHzDmTJH4xT4jx5HjWc2E1"], "tags": ["AI", "generative", "art", "politicians", "public", "power", "struggle", "dominate", "life", "population", "politics", "HEN", "1/1", "NFT", "control", "policies", "hicetnunc"], "extra": {}}
