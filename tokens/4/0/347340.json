Not that I don't know what to say about it, but more so that I am just sick and tired of all the gun violence in America, scratch that we ALL are. Is it any wonder why there's so much gun violence in America? Maybe it has to do with that there are millions and millions of guns out there? Put your hand down Mr. I know my 2nd Amendment Rights and blah, blah, blah. You THINK you know you're 2nd Amendment Rights, but have you looked closer at what the wording is and oh when those words were written? So much has changed since the late 18th Century, like automatic rifles that cause enormous damage. It's disgusting to see people flaunting guns like newborn babies at a baby beauty pageant. I love to ask this one question to most of these gun owners: WHY? Why do you need that? What kind of place are you living in that you need semi and automatic guns? I wish I could make a joke for levity, but no joke could ever lift the evil that guns bear. I made this as my way of saying enough is enough. GET RID OF THE GUNS FOR FUCK'S SAKE. How many innocent people have to die day in and day out? Good god, it's pure insanity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbjpQDXcghnEsJJZyAZKrmdYDtcLXNxo4ZStU9dt9N89G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbsmQkq2HXn8siaZ349EHr4pF22mJcr1wHcKmX4yXENhX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbjpQDXcghnEsJJZyAZKrmdYDtcLXNxo4ZStU9dt9N89G", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
