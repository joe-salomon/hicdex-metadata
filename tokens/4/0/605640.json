It was released in 1995 as a follow up to their triple platinum commercial juggernaut \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d. Although \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d still remain as my personal favorite, \u201cTemples of Boom\u201d was a landmark in the group\u2019s body of work as DJ Muggs start moving away from the original Cypress funky \u2018latin lingo\u2019 sound and into dark, slow, spooky, smokestacked beats. A specific style that the producer would later on perfected as his signature sound.This LP was also universally hailed as the group\u2019s last great album, until they finally found their mojo back with \u201cElephants on Acid\u201d... 23 years later.   \n\nCard is made from Temples of Boom cover art.\n\nFigure is made from Mondo\u2019s Skeletor and Hasbro's Emperor Palpatine figure.\n\nBong is made from a 3 minutes google image search.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTXVctaFdRf23Pmx83VPgSLyFyxGF3wYUZVN2d9D5pUpy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUtQNd41hdrFqBhvtH5nxE7RqynhVUmeE8RniWiCtnA7W", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTXVctaFdRf23Pmx83VPgSLyFyxGF3wYUZVN2d9D5pUpy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aXpmExefGTPY8Zw8WtaLyKK7AzdsvbZw2"], "tags": ["digital", "collage"], "extra": {}}
