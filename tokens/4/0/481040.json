The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: Wolves can move at ten miles an hour. I\u2019m running down a road at fifty miles an hour. I see the enemy ahead of me and attempt to sprint up a hill, but my jersey stops me in my tracks. A centaur on the opposite side of the road has the same effect. I enter a cave, which resembles the dunes of the Mojave Desert. The Centaur and I fight. By chance, I hit a statue of Che Guevara. It\u2019s a lucky hit, accomplishing nothing. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cSo this is death. This is how it ends.\u201d I knelt and wept at the grave injustice of it.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 52 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXqwEPXka83k4Wt8uAgdcTVA94cnk12SEbu6CEkT8M5b7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPdims4iPpYwTZYQCiq2VGNPLQShtT7NtHLG3mqnmtcg6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXqwEPXka83k4Wt8uAgdcTVA94cnk12SEbu6CEkT8M5b7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
