{"__version": 1, "token_id": 386940, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Device #3 // CotyBox PowderCart", "description": "The third of my Device series. This device is loaded with PowderCart, a physics toy. The simulator is running on the device's minimal 182x128 display, while the second 128x64 display is used for selecting materials to use in the game. \n\nNOTE: If you OWN a token for this OBJKT, you will have access to more materials in the game! This is an experimental feature, relying on an external API. \n\nControls: \n - Left click / 1 finger touch to place materials. Use the bottom display to scroll and select materials. \n - When the camera is unlocked, you can Right click / 2 finger touch to rotate the device. \n - When the camera is unlocked, scroll to move the device forward and backwards. \n - Press the switch on the top right of the device to reset the simulation. \n\nNotes: \n - May take a few seconds for the performance to improve and stabilize on mobile devices. Your browser will optimize the runtime during these first few seconds and hopefully reach full speed (60fps or higher).
