For the first time since the pandemic began I traveled out of state, on a drive from Kentucky to Atlanta, Georgia. I've made this drive  dozens of times and there are some really interesting landmarks along the way and decided to try and capture some of them on the drive, and managed to find some new things in remote places as I stopped for gas. AND most of these I snapped the pics as I was driving past them on the highway! I wish I could have had more time to stop and dedicate more effort to capturing quality images.
