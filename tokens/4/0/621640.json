He is a \u201cmanija\u201d of the crypto-world, and help me with so many data about this chaotic-beautiful world. He has an amazing collection called LIGHT, and it\u00b4s inspired by Kase.O\u00b4s theme, Becquer. He invited me to do the sound design in that collection. And for this special song he asked me to do something related with that, this is what I did. My re-interpretation about the poetic meaning of Kase.O beautiful song, and on the cover, I keep some powerful phrase from the original song that resonate with me plus a wink to the work of Cifu and the video of Kase.O. As always, I try to do something sincere, with love & dedication.\n\nDibaxu // tw: @dibaxuP\n\n*This is a collection of special and dedicated song for those collectors that get #1, #2, #3 and #4 for my \u201cAnnotations\u201d collection.
