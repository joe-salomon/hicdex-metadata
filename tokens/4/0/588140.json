This particular image is a unique piece that will be offered to the collector of MM_003_c. \n\nThe framing of something, whether it be visual or mental is a strong concept that occupies a lot of my thinking on the subject of memory. \n\nThese artworks have been crafted with thoughtful insight and tender loving care. On a technical level, they mix home-brewed generative systems with hand-drawn images using Processing and GANs. \n\n1/1 Unique image. \nSize : 5510X7281 PNG [bitmap image] 2021 | Mark Webster @motiondesign_01", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZUKhApz3ZvhWHcAmeDQc37p6wtSx1gTVPV1w8ir3sccg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVGArUK4m92LUZWYccRxonoeESTfbrJwQnQ7e7PMnwrzC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWNKgNXr4CU4JyNfV15yrXyvWxbAiHmbXadKPwXWkHnfq", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZUKhApz3ZvhWHcAmeDQc37p6wtSx1gTVPV1w8ir3sccg", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iZbRAAsj6GfhPqiX3yCoW8F1cw7oXrxG1"], "tags": ["GANs", "neuralnet", "generative", "drawing", "Processing", "markwebster", "memory", "modular"], "extra": {}}
