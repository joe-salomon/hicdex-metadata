The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\u2028\n~~~\n\u2028In my dream: Two men, riding a large black horse, arrive in a large field. They display the animal\u2019s image on a large banner, then loiter. The horse, reflected in the water, appears to have one body, one soul. The horse appears dead, begins to drift. The two men, despite myself, are unhappy with this outcome. I tell one man, \u201cI wish we had brought our own horse.\u201d As we walk together, I ask if he\u2019s hung.\n\u2028~~~\n\u2028\nThe GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\u2028\nHumans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 12 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028\n[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQqvJptJevtv1x4qUso5YoAcYg6MCvB9VQm2pywECvP9o", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNcvvjRPm17PEofMiaLF6TEqzoXhfhHL5m5bLhiY11JVs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQqvJptJevtv1x4qUso5YoAcYg6MCvB9VQm2pywECvP9o", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
