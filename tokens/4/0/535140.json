It was nothing like what we see now. As everything expanded and took up more space, it cooled down.\n\nThe tiny particles grouped together. They formed atoms. Then those atoms grouped together. Over lots of time, atoms came together to form stars and galaxies.\n\nThe first stars created bigger atoms and groups of atoms. That led to more stars being born. At the same time, galaxies were crashing and grouping together. As new stars were being born and dying, then things like asteroids, comets, planets, and black holes formed!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYHgn4mMzdBPqiainpDZhhUzSPDAX2hWZv8DBgxRjFDcD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYHgn4mMzdBPqiainpDZhhUzSPDAX2hWZv8DBgxRjFDcD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYHgn4mMzdBPqiainpDZhhUzSPDAX2hWZv8DBgxRjFDcD", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1UjY1e8jciFXkJGQjKwkSRuy7MxVchGbun"], "tags": ["Stars", "Pixelart", "Pixel", "Earth", "NFT", "PixelAnimation", "Animation", "SimpleAnimation", "Galaxy", "Space", "Planet", "Chrstndvee"], "extra": {}}
