All visuals are procedurally generated. The koi pond and the surrounding garden can be interacted with.\n\nButterflies live in the plants surrounding the pond. The environment cycles through several weather conditions that influence animal behavior. Plants are swayed by the wind, but they can also be moved by user interaction.\n\nThe simulation will always produce the same sequence of events, until the user interacts with it. Interactions cause a \"butterfly effect\", that will set future events on a completely different and unpredictable track.\n\nThe koi ponds are based on my koi breeding game Koi Farm. This interactive simulation was built on Javascript and WebGL; no third party code was used.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV9SoAohMemJ5tepjSES3BrFqNkPLk5pe7afgvYuM4ZkQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb7XevmbQQ2kfvBmG3CpgvxkvSsh6xPyJfRK3fa8dxQB8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV9SoAohMemJ5tepjSES3BrFqNkPLk5pe7afgvYuM4ZkQ", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1LqqBVNDznxrxnoTKZ2akey971CoKqMJyR"], "tags": ["procedural", "webgl", "animated", "jobtalle", "interactive", "pond", "koi"], "extra": {}}
