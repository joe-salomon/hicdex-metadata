{"__version": 1, "token_id": 286540, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ignis Fatuus", "description": "\"Ignis Fatuus\" is defined by Wikipedia as an atmospheric ghost light seen by travelers at night. It is said to beckon and mislead those who encounter it. Folklore attributes it to spirits and ghosts. Science states that it's a natural phenomena caused by organic decay. \nIn literature, it's often used as a metaphor for an enticing but ultimately unattainable goal. \n\nThis piece reflects my own ongoing search for the soul and the meaning. Is there a higher plan? Are we divine beings or is our sentience a freak accident of chance and evolution? Does some part of us remain after death? \n\nJust like the ignis fatuus these questions beckon me, yet the answers shall remain out of reach, shrouded by the darkness, until the day I myself succumb to it.\n\nIs this a soul you see escaping the body, or is it just some  bioluminescence caused by the organic decay?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigj5ppzq776ikyvwoqvbac6zwmq4q5lcmtvsc5eil6ycvyclgjoqq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifylwlmpsmo65wbzzmotdxc4pftssri7qvwvberh6hrxymdb7dv3q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigj5ppzq776ikyvwoqvbac6zwmq4q5lcmtvsc5eil6ycvyclgjoqq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aa4Qn2HbNvfVAC5Qb9qCU2iVLNqtuRhTK"], "tags": ["eyesoflamia", "ignis", "fatuus", "soul", "decay"], "extra": {}}
