Allah humiliates those who disbelieve or disobey him. Once a man is digraced by Allah, he will never be honoured.\n\nSay, \u201cO Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent. (Quran 3:26)\n\nBut upon many the punishment has been justified. And he whom Allah humiliates \u2013 for him there is no bestower of honor. Indeed, Allah does what He wills. (Quran 22:18)\n\nIndeed, the ones who oppose Allah and His Messenger \u2013 those will be among the most humbled.
