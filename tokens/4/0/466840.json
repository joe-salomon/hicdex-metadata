So you can gain more points by playing even other games.\n\nFor more and future information visit \nhttps://games.safoura.art\ndiscord.gg/v3HGdGuT\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUZ1oB8Jhv5wjpPAo6JxNGW33eeMi6RCHJ4LBBGpeE1SW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQYEVzN9qv4WSnLpVPuo3YdAaLEgEdNiBF4AUYxATfpLE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUZ1oB8Jhv5wjpPAo6JxNGW33eeMi6RCHJ4LBBGpeE1SW", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1cnvR3GibQknPY7R9quPLWYrttpEdxsAYZ"], "tags": ["arash", "coincrush", "generativeart", "javascript", "game", "programart", "js", "colorful", "digital", "codeart", "html", "dog", "generative", "gamification", "programming", "coin", "tezos"], "extra": {}}
