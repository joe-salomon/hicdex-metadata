Wear it like an armour and it can never be used to hurt you\".\n.\n. \nQuoted by one who was Utterly hated by his own father and sister, Mocked and ridiculed for being a dwarf , Unfairly Blamed for the tradgedic death of his mother, and still embraced his self and took on the world with his wit and intelligence. One can say Tyrion has come a long way with self acceptance.\n.\n.\nAs an artist we have to embrace our awkwardness, respect our struggles  and take opportunities head on. And only then are we free to express, only then does our art becomes truly ours.\nTyrion lannister for me is a symbol of self acceptance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTc1QenH4oq1ZgUPPoUo55y5TRCZ53FoKQu58A6GBW82S", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYWRYhM5q6dtXB44vQP8UpgdQZMykDjzeQaDmqTYgAvcc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTc1QenH4oq1ZgUPPoUo55y5TRCZ53FoKQu58A6GBW82S", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Y7wYftjqe4iU3SiLg5yZZqaGqTnWsTGWs"], "tags": ["Selfacceptancepiece", "watercolor+digitalretouch", "portraitillustration"], "extra": {}}
