We are all a part of the same orbit. Each time we have contact with something, whether it is a person or a book or a flower or a tree or the sky, it affects us in some way. This effect is the same for each of us. Each one of us is an individual but at the same time we are a part of the universe and we are all the same.\n\n1440x1440 60fps mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmctFGJ8iSUm1vgvzhdZYsq8X9RcmCkZfnBg3sfe6iibV1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWX9uTDpeA8iY35rS97fs1mcfYomWxWPBfeC9GPXi4xNr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmctFGJ8iSUm1vgvzhdZYsq8X9RcmCkZfnBg3sfe6iibV1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1X1ECatY8S83DfyFSUj2JEf1fLxs9tXkeg"], "tags": ["loop", "perfectloop", "hexagon", "spheres", "fractal", "tomato"], "extra": {}}
