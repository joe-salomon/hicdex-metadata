Even a single object has more colors than we could imagine. \nHow we see colors all depends on your own perspectives. It\u2019s easier to see colors in a painting, than seeing colors around us, when we don\u2019t value our surroundings as much as we should. We only seek the vibrant, intriguing, and beautiful colors, rather than seeing the plain, sorrow, and unpleasant one, without even realizing that the unpleasant ones are sometimes the one that gives more colors as well. \nWhen we paint, there\u2019s a lot of different mixture, different source of palate, and varies of techniques, trying to make the more perfect appearance than the real object. Because what we wish to see is always the good ones, without realizing the bad ones gave us more lessons. \n\n\n\nLocation: Bandung, Indonesia\nDate of capture: December 2018\nSize: 13.4MB\nDevice: Canon EOS 80D, 18-135mm Lens", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT5MyKTJMk59YVv8Q7yo1MBEbwgiiDVUxrHy4kQgEgkv2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXtyL7bozKQbgJLVTvZEKb7sp5o5fF5eGsH3qh5bnKQGK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT5MyKTJMk59YVv8Q7yo1MBEbwgiiDVUxrHy4kQgEgkv2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1feWSMBdi8jZ5Lcg2ukoA4wtm35Apx21Zx"], "tags": ["watercolor", "illustration", "photography", "palates", ""], "extra": {}}
