This is an artist's interpretation of this movement, with a rotating anemone whose tentacles appear and disappear. Move the mouse around to interact with the digital anemone and watch its colors change.\n\n\nSea Anemones are not endangered, but they are vulnerable to pollution and climate change. This is an environmental issue because other species, like the clownfish, depend on the sea anemones to survive.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTAmwawB9FsjcXTyBAxfene58uJaeJrhDAKBsnywjuQnq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYh5xT9SDgWuqAexuSHjteUQuGqiLf4wzJwuh77usuoWo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTAmwawB9FsjcXTyBAxfene58uJaeJrhDAKBsnywjuQnq", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1TVCbYZgLYiqvYNgDbALHDVfzaKYK5yih2"], "tags": ["seaanemone", "wildlife", "nature", "ecology", "interactive", "nature-inspired", "generative", "purple", "five", "tentacles"], "extra": {}}
