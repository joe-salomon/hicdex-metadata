{"__version": 1, "token_id": 536849, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Modular Visualiser MKII circa 1975", "description": "After the commercial failure of the first Mini Modular Visualiser in the early 70s, the decision was made to release the Modular Visualiser MKII around 1975. Larger in scale and with more advanced features than its predecessor, critics claimed it was a pale imitation - rushed into production to take advantage of the surprise cult success of the previous model. While this may be somewhat true, the added features and increase in scale were seen as enough to win over fans. However, similar to its predecessor the Modular Visualiser MKII was riddled with technical issues. Most notably, small emissions of a rare type of radiation. In a number of cases, prolonged exposure would trigger what some would describe as 'telekinetic abilities' while the majority of cases would experience initial loss of taste, hallucinogenic visions and the eventual liquification of brain tissue. The Modular Visualiser MKII was soon discontinued, and similar to its predecessor can sometimes be found on black market trading networks.
