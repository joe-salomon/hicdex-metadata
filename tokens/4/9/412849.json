The Inca culture had a unique relationship with rocks and stones: The Incas thought stones were alive and each one had a distinct personality. The streets photographed on a rainy night, portray the celebration of light and darkness, as Incas built these streets with their bare hands. At night, their spirits continue to walk through these streets.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNe5VrT1Kj1WuABF7YuoUrQYWb82vtGqofkZ4JgtjwohN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNTRncsYH5W25NMjmFCd9Cn6g9vjje6cJoHzFMtFhQefg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNe5VrT1Kj1WuABF7YuoUrQYWb82vtGqofkZ4JgtjwohN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dxNCjAaCDtzDEysEYr8ErzFwWoQVGB889"], "tags": ["digital"], "extra": {}}
