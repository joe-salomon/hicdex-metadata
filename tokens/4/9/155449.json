The hacker later joined the #\ud83d\udc1breport-bugs channel on the hicetnunc Discord under the screen name hen-exploiter, taking responsibility for the hack. This is a portrait of hen-exploiter as most Discord users got to know him on that day. \u2014 Artist: Rapha\u00ebl de Courville (@sableraph) \u2014 14 frames at 1000 \u00d7 1000 pixels", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU8RQLhBXk39a5k5958conzsHL15T6j6C6b9pGE5i5qL8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU8RQLhBXk39a5k5958conzsHL15T6j6C6b9pGE5i5qL8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU8RQLhBXk39a5k5958conzsHL15T6j6C6b9pGE5i5qL8", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hfuVWgcJ89ZE75ut9Qroi3y7GFJL5Lf2K"], "tags": ["hicxploit", "hicexploit", "hen-exploiter", "discord", "gif"], "extra": {}}
