Its structure is visible from far distances in downtown Tabriz, if not blocked by the newly erected highrise buildings.\n\nThe structure was initially a compound, containing a great vaulted mosque, adjoining prayer halls and libraries, a vast courtyard containing a huge reflecting pool, and a mausoleum\u2014all surrounded by a containing wall. It was built in 14th century during the Ilkhanate era. The point of pride for the building was that its vaulted ayvan was larger than the famous historic vault of Chosroes/Kisra or the Taq Kisra at Ctesiphon/Mada'in. However, with the sudden death of the governor of the city and with some construction complications in constructing a roofed building without pillar for such a huge complex, the mausoleum structure remained incomplete. In the 19th century with the rise of tensions between Iran and Russia the structure rapidly turned into the city's fort and additional military installations such as a barracks and cannon foundry were added to the original structure. During the twentieth century the military installations were removed from original construction and the surrounding of the ark turned into a park. In the late twentieth century a big mosque was built next to the citadel.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXvBgx1MAqRSvAfjRHpm1XyyT2y6inBNTucQ22Uh4VzsK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQQy3S6nWSqWqAiNy6xPGVFnTTkJmL8XBtq7mrUA5WH61", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXvBgx1MAqRSvAfjRHpm1XyyT2y6inBNTucQ22Uh4VzsK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1byfv1EckZBdrd9Z3CVp6nY8W7WRYWf6qn"], "tags": ["type", "typography", "iranian", "3dart", "asia", "hen200k", "font", "culture", "mehranerfan", "cultural", "calligraphy", "colors", "iran", "artist", "nftart", "generatives", "colorful", "persiancalligraphy", "grunge", "texture", "pattern", "black", "dark", "history", "tabriz", "arg", "russia", "battle", "war", "ancient"], "extra": {}}
