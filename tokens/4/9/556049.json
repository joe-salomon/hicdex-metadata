All composed of a red circle in the background, with details in red and white eyes, with beautiful hair in black and details in white and sometimes in red. \n\nI finally found myself, found my art style, adapted the grime art style to what I like to do and created a unique style that is only mine! \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW1LFwqAHyQLPgYinAfDsSo7f2prhqbhyr3Hk31x5eN4D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcKMDbYFE4KUmto6CNdK5K52LuFFDdnAt6iZ3pAtZwHXT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW1LFwqAHyQLPgYinAfDsSo7f2prhqbhyr3Hk31x5eN4D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hgN7qH6HsLnXW1MiRzNMXr6mkUXhdeytS"], "tags": ["grimeart", "red", "girl", "brasil", "brazil", "bft", "hen", "illustrator", "illustration", "illustracion", "design", "arttwork", "desenho", "artedigital", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}
