I let them know I just like to document Houston. They thanked me and allowed me to take portraits as well because Leroy (right) said what I was doing was important.\nHim telling me that made me open up about an interaction I had a bit earlier that day where a person told me \"get that shit out of Houston, we don't want it here\" after I took a photo of a man near him (I will be sharing this as well).\nLeroy told me:\n\nDon't listen to that shit, keep doing what you love because you want to. I can tell you love this and those people are just stuck in their ways and wont amount to anything. Keep on doing you and pursuing your dream.\nI think about those words often when I'm doubting my photography. He doesn't even know he's a huge inspiration for me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaeomvHVe88fp3iEaxoK2js8owXsPYZBxDqTccg49Xn26", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXBUSRt3cyt9jY8P6mkPhAtjj7BgMaJoTCwsWdTKrzFAB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaeomvHVe88fp3iEaxoK2js8owXsPYZBxDqTccg49Xn26", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
