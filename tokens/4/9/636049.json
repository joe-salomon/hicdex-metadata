But, it was more than just a gaping void \u2013 as its name is usually translated from Ancient Greek 'Chaos' was the primal feature of the universe, a shadowy realm of mass and energy from which much of what is powerful in the world would stem forth in later.\nIn religious scriptures 'Chaos' is mostly referred to the primordial state before creation, strictly combining two separate notions of primordial waters or a primordial darkness from which a new order emerges and a primordial state as a merging of opposites, such as heaven and earth, which must be separated by a creator deity in an act of cosmogony.\n\nThis is a series of fluid art paintings created in Dec 2021.\n\nPlease connect with me on twitter @singh99abhay or email me- abhay99.tez@gmail.com if you wish to talk more about this painting", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS95J7ypubuYw7BARFwu5CV6N3Hrzp8VMnW18BnU6jGSQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQTkgBp8bSjHckwvGtiik5rmEAyehokmRvSxfEVVMHkqW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS95J7ypubuYw7BARFwu5CV6N3Hrzp8VMnW18BnU6jGSQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dZApNMmkt4CaWcxozWLUNxekLELMxZ6Bw"], "tags": ["chaos", "void", "fluid", "art"], "extra": {}}
