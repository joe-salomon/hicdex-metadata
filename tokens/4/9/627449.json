Without a doubt, yes. Take for instance the word CONFINED, if we happened to drop an \"F\" bomb right on top of CONFINED, we get COFFINED; as if to intimate something sudden and terrible occurred, thus knocking the \"N\" out of CONFINED and dropping to a pile of other \"N\"s. The narrative we could associate is we live our lives in a confined box, thinking we know everything that is within that box, only to get the fucked ultimately by death. Then placed in a coffin and then buried. Short, simple, and right to the point.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNghZmAMM1vUHpiKDJbretnzCaPuqQwNRYtkVfVkRytxA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTVd3MZLndWUk9N6F55F4YRuJy7VdT5Q672iBbJRAbfDC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNghZmAMM1vUHpiKDJbretnzCaPuqQwNRYtkVfVkRytxA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
