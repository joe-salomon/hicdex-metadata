Life's screwed, academic were hanging, friends gone too. I didn't have enough belief to continue the life journey. At those low life-phase, i often stared at the sun in the middle of daylight.\n\nSeeing the sun often made me realize that life's been tough for many people. I imagined how Jakartans were going thru' routine's life. Imagined how hard it was for some daily workers going thru' busy day, hating the sunlight because it's really hot it could burn their skin.\n\nBut there were no options for them. Many people can only surrender to keep on living.
