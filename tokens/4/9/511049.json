But that's not the problem of reality.\n\nAbout the image: \nThis one is a true palimpsest. \nIt is based on a very early Photoshop edit of a photo (self-portrait). Round about 15 years later it got modified based on some Deep Dream / GAN experiments. \nMonths later it got glitched via audacity (editing the raw data as if it were audio data) and then manually modified as a late fine-tuning.\nThe whole work was not planned or heavily conceptualized. All assets along the way were used as input for a new transformational process.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSzjsTV2R1XC6cv7CnoQjoh4Qt1BrMa3bVkMoL8rR4ErB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYKGrzot9YBswJu41RGv5fDsdrKCQzGmgPXPx89GTDd4V", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSzjsTV2R1XC6cv7CnoQjoh4Qt1BrMa3bVkMoL8rR4ErB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Ta4wUo4G3phRSvnmyVZw6xPo8zteUwDyV"], "tags": ["glitch", "self-portrait"], "extra": {}}
