I've started making fun of astronauts in the \"Space Struggle\" series during their Instagram boom in 2017. Even after couple of years they are still everywhere and becoming a symbol of NFTs. There is starting a tension between other artists who pointing out on abusing the trend to gain easier exposure. Even though I have sketches for many more episode I've decided to stop supporting this trend by creating a symbolic death of the astronauts and want to focus on other topics.
