Those opportunities that seem small, but could roll into something incredible.\n\nInstead, I choose to let my manifestations go. To practice a conscious detachment from the want, and instead to continue on. Trusting that things will fall into place when they are meant too.\n\nAnd guess what? Once I let go of the attachment, things happen. And if they don't - something even better comes along later.\n\nDon't believe me?
