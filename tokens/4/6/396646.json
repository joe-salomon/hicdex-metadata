He opens what is closed and makes what is unclear, clear. He has the best of judgement and holds the keys to victory and success.\n\nSay, \u201cOur Lord will bring us together; then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Knowing Judge.\u201d (Quran 34:26)\n\nWhatever Allah grants to people of mercy \u2013 none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds \u2013 none can release it thereafter. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. (Quran 35:2)\n\nWe would have invented against Allah a lie if we returned to your religion after Allah had saved us from it. And it is not for us to return to it except that Allah, our Lord, should will. Our Lord has encompassed all things in knowledge. Upon Allah we have relied. Our Lord decide between us and our people in truth, and You are the best of those who give decision.
