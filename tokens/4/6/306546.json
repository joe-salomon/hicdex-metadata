My beginnings are serene in straight yet strong currents that cause me to slip over rocks, carrying out leaves and flowers along. I manifest my emotions through the tears flooding in an immensity of living things. Now I perceive myself as deeper, I always make noise, but only those who get close can hear. I am clear. I give out my body to whoever takes care of my head, a vast amount of minerals cleanses and transforms any energy. The singing far away reaches clouds and lands, keeping the balance between the sky and the earth. Looking through water mirrors I see layers inside me. Everything is now washed away and dissolved. My eyelids shut because I can't absorb so much light into my little eyes. But with eyes closed I cover myself with an illuminated mantle that penetrates my pores and I trust it. My home is the waters of my own womb, I am a fish that knows everything. I own a tail.
