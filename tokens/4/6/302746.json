This specific series deals with image and our relationship with art as a society && individuals.\n // \n\u201cThe way that art is experienced in these spaces has changed beyond recognition. The museum has adopted the strategy of mass media; an emphasis on spectacle, the cult of the celebrity masterpiece, art clocked through the blink of an eye or through the lens of a camera. But what it\u2019s gained through an increase in these numbers, it\u2019s lost in terms of freedom of access and availability to the eye and the mind.\u201d -Robert Hughes\n // \nPROCESS: Databend [jpg, png, tiff, gif, webp], Processing, Java. \nFirst I glitched the Mona Lisa in Notepad++ in different image formats, then fed those images through a glitch program written in Processing.
