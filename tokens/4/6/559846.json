Therefore, in his time, the children in the village often beat each other and together played games such as hide and seek, dragon snakes in the clouds after school. Those memories are really priceless to me, to other children at that time. On the full moon day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar every year, we eagerly look forward to the most special holiday of the year, the Mid-Autumn Festival. It must be said that the Mid-Autumn Festival has come from the first day of the month, not until the full moon day. That's when on the streets, people sell mooncake stalls, with golden brown pies, white soft cakes. Grocery stores sell a lot of Mid-Autumn Festival toys for children. Surely everyone has seen the masks of Sun Wukong, Superman Gao, wish-fulfilling sticks, water cannons, lanterns, and especially star lanterns. The greatest joy for me at that time was when my mother went to the market to buy a mask, or a star lamp to carry the light with my friends on the full moon night. Growing up, when life goes into the cycle of worries and work, we gradually lose the joy of childhood. This year, when COVID raged, it would be difficult for all of us to have a bustling Mid-Autumn Festival, bringing the exciting atmosphere of the festival. Instead, we can spend more time with family, spend more time with ourselves, temporarily put aside the chaos of life to enjoy a very different Mid-Autumn Festival.\n\"Mid-Autumn Festival is Children's Festival...\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSptKfkQUapR2irt26vDqhMwqw1XWNR6Tnr29S7Cw5wE8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmebrVW34WvHTjoCpEVEvWNNir4HbJ2XS6urQ5RrY2EyrY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSptKfkQUapR2irt26vDqhMwqw1XWNR6Tnr29S7Cw5wE8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1biFE9nezUkAEZmZGtGqWawH3VpFdpmbhk"], "tags": ["unicorn", "Mid-Autumn", "colorscheme", "art"], "extra": {}}
