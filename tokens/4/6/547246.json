As much as I love the 80s, teen cult classic movies, and true crime, somehow I've never heard of this movie and came across it accidentally on Prime. The concept, loosely based on a true story, is good and Keanu Reeves is also good, especially considering this one was one of his first movies. The movie itself just dragged on, the 'incident' was shown in the first scene and the killer was known, so the rest of the story was just random and thrown together. Also Crispin Glover might be the worst actor on the planet. His character is awful. Every time he spoke I wanted to scream. He made it almost unbearable to finish the movie. He over-acted and was trying to be funny even though it was a very dark film. I can't believe that guy ever got another acting gig after this.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdtmnihJNSnVFiG1PjfYhS14K1CskS34uoRXeMt3Zr3N6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdtmnihJNSnVFiG1PjfYhS14K1CskS34uoRXeMt3Zr3N6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdtmnihJNSnVFiG1PjfYhS14K1CskS34uoRXeMt3Zr3N6", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1b4UhwsKz9fGSYTWCjtuc7ezxv4YsCGG5U"], "tags": ["riversedge", "entropic", "entrippy"], "extra": {}}
