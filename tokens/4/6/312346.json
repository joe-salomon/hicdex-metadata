{"__version": 1, "token_id": 312346, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "the enchanted tree", "description": "There\u2019s a beautiful, yet sad myth in my culture about the enchanted maiden, who once was betrayed by her beloved one. The maiden called \u2019mavka\u2019 ran to the forest to find her death, and when they met, she was turned into the tree. I like this story because it\u2019s quite peaceful to know that people can start growing the actual roots after death and can embody their identity in nature. \"the enchanted tree\" is featured in BIT.SHES Collection iDENTITY | 01 | Vol.2 - All proceeds from this piece go to charitable organizations making a difference for positive change.
