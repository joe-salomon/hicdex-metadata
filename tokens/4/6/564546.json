I then added some clavinet and extra synth lines. From there, i made the 808 bass and drum arrangement with loops and one-shots. i also sung the vocals and performed the nylon guitar. Enjoy the sounds and message me if you pick up some editions, you can get access to future releases and the audio files itself.
