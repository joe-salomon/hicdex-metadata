For years, obsessions about safety, death, and health, among others, have run my life. Running away from the obsessions only makes them worse. They shift, change, and grow.

This might even be true of other difficult things in life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmayXSrsRc3gDDKheyy9eFXxsHrv2ueRioS5xekwuw5MaD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWDaC1fQ2T8JXXWDQhZNhyhZoQXC1kh1KQEqVcEB13hkY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmayXSrsRc3gDDKheyy9eFXxsHrv2ueRioS5xekwuw5MaD", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WXSHz8TekNBDDtogEWnLxHsbRfDJzgjBW"], "tags": ["animated", "video", "ocd"], "extra": {}}
