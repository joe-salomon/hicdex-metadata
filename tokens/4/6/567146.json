Personally, it is an experiment with flash, my recent lens purchase, and a bit of an exploration of typography/color palettes. CMYK to me is high-energy and positive, the whole point of GM. \n\nAll proceeds from this token will go right back into the Tezos community, and holders will be offered benefits such as early/exclusive access to content in the future... sometimes in exchange for the token! The goal is to keep the GM's going around. All that being said, I appreciate each and every one of you and your support :)\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQTJfEaPbGdGiDuLdTUb74u2ZnaT79HY7Gbp8oGfaXkWs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWF6L6257JE5aoLDhbxjusfyJNyXirDatfVHb1ADmUEpn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmV2Bv76MoNDG2E5qkWKbpYSkHxN5VcHChA4o2MRraw2EW", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQTJfEaPbGdGiDuLdTUb74u2ZnaT79HY7Gbp8oGfaXkWs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2JPEM7A84v4ozuLFPDCMyAJwPxeYHK3PDm"], "tags": ["gm", "photograph", "typography", "meme", "gn", "photo", "jpg"], "extra": {}}
