The original formula was a local, home-brewed pure cherry soft drink. The drink was rebranded and launched with only slight adjustments to the formula, mixed with Nuka-Cola then enhanced with color to boost visual appeal. It proved to be a drink with enduring popularity, though it was largely limited to the East Coast, but was distributed in large quantities in the vicinity of Boston and West Virginia.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS1hM2Zvp8NcTytz5X8YUMPxDcRBBXKjTkSXDrhPWDdEZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbpUhgY9K5ugHGiWdzw7pW4wuA5BB5fLzzm3iHfWg4CgL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS1hM2Zvp8NcTytz5X8YUMPxDcRBBXKjTkSXDrhPWDdEZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Y45h6xg2y9WWHGZRszV35eSQgZQG927zG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dart", "3dartist", "3danimation", "3drender", "looping", "loop", "loopinggif", "nukacola", "nuka", "bottlecap", "shrednector", "objkt4objkjt"], "extra": {}}
