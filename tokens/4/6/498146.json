I personally digitized and rendered it in 4K for you to enjoy this art in motion. This art speaks about my journey to the NFT. An ordinary painter trying out new things - no expectations, just going with the flow wishing that everything will work itself out. I hope i can make it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSBAfwBAXfW2dmMVQGjX1Kor53mXnCy2UwyKtbPWcHESa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSYQyjthamg1SPG86dnUnF3oKTFXJCZSGVMbEc6neZjJJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSBAfwBAXfW2dmMVQGjX1Kor53mXnCy2UwyKtbPWcHESa", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XYL9eaLUqLda7wTFbLiYnNn7FtTGwc3a9"], "tags": ["painting", "digital", "mp4", "skull", "garden"], "extra": {}}
