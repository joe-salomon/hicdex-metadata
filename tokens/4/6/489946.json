He was so overjoyed that he proudly displayed my brother's penis to everyone of our male relatives and acquaintances. In the ensuing years, the impoverished man's child's penis would become dysfunctional in size and capacity. When he discovered his son had a micropenis, he traveled from doctor to doctor, putting my brother through a lot of pain. As a result of all the stress, my brother became a violent man with numerous addictions. Before completing high school, he began hanging around with street gangs and using the control he gained on the streets to repress his sexual impotence. When we ran into his girlfriend, he would make up some ridiculous excuses for the marks on his face. I'm not sure what happened after that because I cut off all communication with my family. Perhaps the need to get away from them is at the root of the inability to feel at home anywhere and the perpetual shifting of cities.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZjkLEbGXeH5DavKUzZigdPKNm6mv4cr6hAp1XM8EtMSy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZjkLEbGXeH5DavKUzZigdPKNm6mv4cr6hAp1XM8EtMSy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZjkLEbGXeH5DavKUzZigdPKNm6mv4cr6hAp1XM8EtMSy", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1dZDMAtyxM9nowWZm589fNAx3PXPtD9ZLX"], "tags": ["photography", "doodle", "sketch", "collectible", "collectibles", "experimental"], "extra": {}}
