Some might say I'm a bit of a hoarder because I collect and save just about anything I think could be used for a creative purpose. One of my favorite designers when I was in school was David Carson and todays piece is a small homage to him. Some of todays assets were sourced from an old magazine he was Art Director for called Raygun.
