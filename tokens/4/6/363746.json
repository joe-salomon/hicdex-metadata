So this animation has been buried inside my phone and I just found it again today. I shared it with my partner and she said \"why don't you mint it?\". Well, since only a few people have seen it, here it is. Consider it a delayed minting.\n\nIt's based on my 2020 digital collage titled, \"Bapak pergi berperang, perangnya pulang ke sejarah. Sejarah peradaban manusia yang dimulai sejak penemuan pasta gigi dan cara penggunaannya.\" (\"Father left to the war, the war went home to history. The history of human civilization that began with the invention of toothpaste and how to use it.\"). But I shortened it, \"Fruit Drops\" (it's also my partner's suggestion).\n\nEnjoy my toothpaste!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZXGGU5TZyFcyqtekwjcRhKKBPgdfABUTZSDfBMjdTpQE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVtArQPsQWYWdUycg1AvLumoj1ySfPeqf7itZRKSRhixb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZXGGU5TZyFcyqtekwjcRhKKBPgdfABUTZSDfBMjdTpQE", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1av3PU2PNW6WxHVZuVSAwjbySs7McRLEFB"], "tags": ["collage", "cartoon", "jurnalkolasefrnss", "animation", "photoshop", "premier"], "extra": {}}
