The subject was rare in seventeenth-century Spain, where overtly sensual images were met with disapproval by the Catholic Church. Venus, the goddess of love, reclines languidly on her bed, the curve of her body echoed in the sweep of sumptuous satin fabric.\n\nCollated using a collection of JPG files from ALAMY. The wide colour variation between each example makes it difficult to assess the artist\u2019s original palette.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcrkXYJHFErwjzctFdWdtLjMZxHtESDNC25VED3ssZJQZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSzHi4GnfcbLmNgYPpFXbkMrLzqjsj5QsJ46JL7KDG5Rb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcrkXYJHFErwjzctFdWdtLjMZxHtESDNC25VED3ssZJQZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1f9TBznxnaPVmh6V7JRXQYK3qkPQfFn5wV"], "tags": ["remastered", "velazquez"], "extra": {}}
