While climbing this mountain, I had to stop a few times. I got the altitude sickness. I was not very well prepared for this last hike. I felt a bit dizzy and had to slow down my pace. I reached the summit last in the group, but I did not care. I was so proud that I had not given up and was rewarded with this fantastic view.\n\n5616px X 3744px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdWkhX2Lyhuye6UDuBteU5HScTqPhJG7iKWUdfLQNskK8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSuoyNgt5JeGAoV8JQhBdXUt9PoLaxTcs6Y5bHyDQzE5c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdWkhX2Lyhuye6UDuBteU5HScTqPhJG7iKWUdfLQNskK8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VE8kpjJGBEPsrrErtrc8NKC8oKe1cQTWF"], "tags": ["photography", "trekking", "journey", "nepal", "culture", "nature"], "extra": {}}
