Alien life possibly appearing on a vacant wall just before a pizza. \n\nPhotography of things that do not exist for more than a fleeting moment, undefined by time and space. \nNonsensical environments where logic and reality do not hold sway. Accidental imagery relying more on chance, whim, obtuse thought patterns and often a sense of play. The relentless search for the lightness and darkness within life.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmczV8G8gqb2z7dCMriAn4BBZEgt7J1y3FFuakbkaPnJsN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWPeRJsDQy6sWXHre6XekFGbTRGaynpL7FQ97edUcFJkZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmczV8G8gqb2z7dCMriAn4BBZEgt7J1y3FFuakbkaPnJsN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2GrFRgAWXLhT62DM7b9WMqhEsBH1bWR93u"], "tags": ["#art#nft#nftart#alisonwilliams#aliens#life#light#takeout#play#unknown"], "extra": {}}
