The concept of this collection is to share insights about art/image/history, and express them visually, while keeping the process experimental, and fun.\n\nI embrace the instability of my hand to fell more present in my works, and turn mistakes into a creative process frame by frame (see: Boil Line Animation). My goal is to share the best pieces of knowledge that I\u2019ve acquired studying during my life.\n\n~\n\nMoon shard\n\nPhoto-edited ground textures and 25 hand drawn frames\nDimensions: 1000x1000p\nFile type: .gif\nFile size: 10,3 MB (10.901.067 bytes)\nEl Cocones, 2021.\n\n~\n\n\n[Note #01: Backgrounds can play a big role in visual compositions, use it at your own risk.
