This generative artwork was released as a limited edition mint [1/5] on Hic Et Nunc by Kenny Vaden. First an orange background was drawn, followed by a series of large partially transparent red circles and a large dark red disc. Thirty bowing arcs were drawn from top to bottom, with a larger number of tiles hanging below each. Each tile was filled with a gradient color. A faint black disc was drawn atop the tiles, making the red disc underneath pop out. The image dimensions for this file are 30x15 inches and resolution is 300 DPI, which produced a file size below the limit, which provides a higher resolution (more detail) than the original version shown online.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmagRno9SJJtwqHAaQdeE2dmjbPADVJcuUkTzpfWsjtQd8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYPSSa7wWkh7n93UMzq3kfPCnij5TFB2vBXYSLRBochZv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmagRno9SJJtwqHAaQdeE2dmjbPADVJcuUkTzpfWsjtQd8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bEHdSDNdTTPmuin84c6LWqruepu6a5sc5"], "tags": ["Circles", "Lines", "Polygons", "GenerativeArt", "RCode"], "extra": {}}
