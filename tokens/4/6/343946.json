{"__version": 1, "token_id": 343946, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Crystal Phoenix", "description": "At the end of its life, the elder phoenix consumes itself so it can be reborn as its child. This particular one was special because it wasn't part of its flock. As a teen, it refused to participate in the society that controlled its every movement, so it left under moonlight to find its own path. For the rest of its life, it would dodge those who hunted it down for treason, yet all failed. \n\nThe moon would guide its way through a fulfilling life of love, joy, and independence. At the point of death, it wondered what would happen. It wouldn't remember any of its previous life or the fact that it had separated from its flock. It worried about a little baby bird left alone in a world where its flock hunted it. But as the flames roared and burned it away, it looked up to see the moon bright and full shining down, and it knew everything would be fine.
