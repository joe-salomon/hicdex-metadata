At this time, ballet became a serious form of dramatic art and was equivalent to opera. This progress was due to Jean-Georges Noverre's important work Lettres sur la danse et les ballets (1760), which pioneered the development of ballet d'action in which dancers were required to express characters and present a narrative story. Ballet music itself was developed very rapidly at that time by composers such as Christopher Gluck. At the end of that period, opera was divided into three formal techniques, namely s\u00e9rieux, demi-caract\u00e8re and comique, and ballet became part of opera as an introduction to scenes known as divertissements.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcsuUTDC8RBZKq4vCeyCXWvXbHoLG2T7qQjZgkVVb4RHJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPnFo1wur9ReNCPq9iLJePVMMGWdHZQPszAU78cDd81Ux", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcsuUTDC8RBZKq4vCeyCXWvXbHoLG2T7qQjZgkVVb4RHJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2SvnPoKVTidSae6Dx3SER59QoQYHz9QFyA"], "tags": ["ballerina", "balle", "white", "world", "ballet", "beautiful", "photography"], "extra": {}}
