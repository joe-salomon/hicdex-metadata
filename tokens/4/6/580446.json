I use different tools to give it life, I like strong and contradictory colors as is my own chemistry. I like the surprise that generative art produces in me, which gives it a new life. Segment them whimsically, in a bold collage that has strength and visual impact, that says things and makes you feel. Maybe when I draw women I express the women that inhabit me...\n\"To become free, a woman must feel free, not to rival men, but free in her capacities and personality.\" (Indira Gandhi)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZcDUwehCohnast94TQWjEqRN5P3gbfWKq76FhodCpTt6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZcDUwehCohnast94TQWjEqRN5P3gbfWKq76FhodCpTt6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZcDUwehCohnast94TQWjEqRN5P3gbfWKq76FhodCpTt6", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1gE7i3NjxuS65bGcVjBpmoMidjyy2xPR9S"], "tags": ["drawing", "woman", "latina", "generativeart", "gifart", "collage", "xeldajara", "cryptoart", "NFT"], "extra": {}}
