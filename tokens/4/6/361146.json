By mid-June of 2020, the pandemic was spreading everywhere and fast. Trump & Co. kept doing nothing, it was scary times for everyone. He predicted that by April 2020 that like a miracle it will just go away; it didn't of course. This work was basically about rage and sadness for all the people that were needlessly dying, for the regular people that were losing their jobs, for the businesses were closing on a daily basis. This is probably either a great work or an absolute dud...time will tell. I don't run from expression; I let it out. I never hold back and good god I never hold back on Trump. If you're a person that voted for Trump...fuck you. I don't care if you voted for him for the tax cuts or because you think his economic policies are to \"Make America Great Again\". I don't give a damn. Face it, he's a con man and you've been conned. It's that simple. End of story. I find it ironic that so many Trump supporters refuse to get vaccinated and as the virus mutates into stronger and stronger versions of itself, guess who the people are getting infected, you guys. Good luck with that. Sorry for the rant, but science needs to come back, common sense needs to come back, and compassion needs to come back big time. We need more love in this world, not Trump and his Cult 45.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPvBBT8xwyXvpDrDo9Cb7znPT9axZVC7vcioVsH4MLKV5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRoYKKQ1mz4bPxPiRi65zJPqcKe4LVnfeD5G4boNfPBwU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPvBBT8xwyXvpDrDo9Cb7znPT9axZVC7vcioVsH4MLKV5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
