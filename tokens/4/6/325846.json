Analog piece created using watercolor, markers, ink and acrylics. \n\nBirds and archetypes of birds feature heavily in lots of my work and with time I have built quite a collection of bird archetypes in different media and mixture of them. Sometimes bird motif would sneak itself into my work, even when I am creating something quite different. I have huge fascination with birds as they posses the super power of flying. There is a tremendous sense of freedom associated with the ability to fly  and there is a great playfulness expressed by bird spirits as well as a sense of mystical.
