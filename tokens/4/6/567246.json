Each chapter of this series will be released soon, each as a rare NFT.\n\n\nEmmon Gray is a researcher who dedicated her life to creating new vessels in which consciousness may dwell. She called her creations Quasi-Autonomous Beings but most people call them Kwasis. Her first creation was a bio-mechanical version of herself, with an advanced A.I. installed and a range of selected memories. The creation outlived the creator and began a search for meaning, eventually being drawn to the arcane technology known as Mahjuti.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX2e8NAYok4Vvqq5SP321qfx8jk5fA8ffvjFdRZ3Lrz87", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX2e8NAYok4Vvqq5SP321qfx8jk5fA8ffvjFdRZ3Lrz87", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX2e8NAYok4Vvqq5SP321qfx8jk5fA8ffvjFdRZ3Lrz87", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QgkEnqqsRDcrC6W77SPvjCgzPFNGfNweB"], "tags": ["graphicnovel", "scfifantasy", "cyberpunk", "femalecharacter", "veilofthegods", "glyphs"], "extra": {}}
