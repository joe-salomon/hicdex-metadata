{"__version": 1, "token_id": 507846, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Bitsium #6", "description": "10 NFT series\n3277x4096px\n \nGives collectors\u2019 a heightened ability to predict outcomes from games of chance. Test subjects went to a casino and consistently won. 3 of the 5 subjects were accused of cheating and got beat up by mobsters.\n \nCollectors who procure a Bitsium microgemanism will be able to foresee the end results of events with extraordinary accuracy. Especially with games that involve risk. Bitsium is ineffective at helping to avoid things like stepping in dog crap.\n \nOnce each test subject was transferred a Bitsium NFT  they immediately started to play poker. Since all of the participants had a good idea of what the other players' cards were, the stakes never increased. So they went to a Las Vagas Casino.\n \nSubjects won large sums of money from gambling. No subject won anything from the slot machines which supports my hypothesis that slot machines are for suckers. Bitsium doesn\u2019t help predict mating behavior, Subjects were always turned down by waitresses.\n \nSubjects caught the attention of the casino owners who took them to a VIP room which turned out to be a back alley where they were assaulted and told \u201cthis is what you get when you count cards at my casino\u201d. Luckily subjects signed Liability Waivers.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTKnzv8KPqceLBY1pv89etEqDh6Um1e86qZ8o6tNU96t2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTdtmR1JEV1NFqCPMLkZFQkEMEpYPnbqwJb5vmE5UnRsi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTKnzv8KPqceLBY1pv89etEqDh6Um1e86qZ8o6tNU96t2", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1bhWBkjekfaCUdv71XvDkGjwHJ5HH4xxdT"], "tags": ["microgemanisms", "Digital", "Art", "Glitch", "Trippy", "Colorful", "Bit", "16Bit", "Pixel", "Collage", "Manipulation", "Abstract"], "extra": {}}
