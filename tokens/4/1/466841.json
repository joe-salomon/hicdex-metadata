Here I mean a deep understanding based on personal life history, something that few viewers are obliged to do.\nIn fact, it may be said that the issue of our perception of things is hidden in our perception of life, or in other words, in our understanding of the \"how and why\" of our lives, and of course in finding the relationship between the result of this perception and what we see.\n\nIt is only by providing the question that we get to the starting point: what is hidden behind our lives? A constant question whose answer cannot be easily linked to what we see (or rather do not see).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRoButAySJi9aZqvxKcPREDphXHQPb7V9g8r1DTpm45Q7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYrjHfr6BXK6SDEZZAKu8tfrvUPsruuqxZW9JcjvnTo4r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRoButAySJi9aZqvxKcPREDphXHQPb7V9g8r1DTpm45Q7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QJa6UDQwDnLuTU4tBgUtqiA6wngbyPDTb"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "selfportrait", "blackandwhite", "theory", "perception"], "extra": {}}
