Two sets of triangles are arranged evenly throughout the canvas. some are pink, some are blue, with a solid color  background.   However the background appears to be two different colors.It shifts between yellow and green as the viewer focuses on different  parts of the composition. The eye darts around the page as it follows the triangle's pattern.The way our minds interpret reality, may not be an accurate representation of what the external world actually is. In this scenario one cannot see it to believe. One must believe it to see it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUifk8JzWEhHBa45PSLhMXS6eGRTMvmXhAHi5rt4yJUsw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRUZUd3H1NdGcAYm3p85Dc3Hq5UDmE7669yW6tneJdDbW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUifk8JzWEhHBa45PSLhMXS6eGRTMvmXhAHi5rt4yJUsw", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fBRQrpjuLtqrpPK6Us3W2nJfd6CFdJerJ"], "tags": ["geometric", "opticalillusion", "Trippy", "abstract", "modern", "contemporary", "digital", "programmed"], "extra": {}}
