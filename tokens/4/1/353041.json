It became the exclusive religion of this country by a decree of King Filomenus, at the time of the monarchy. It is said that the king, under the effects of the vapors of The Night of the Frogs, saw various creatures who appeared before him and asked to be honored under strange rituals or else the country would burn in flames. \nPeppos are hermaphrodite beings that live in swampy areas. When the right rituals are performed, they help and give shelter to the desperate. One of them is the Harmony Peppo. They bring peace of mind to those who execute the ritual of the hundred steps with utmost efficiency. \nIt is said that the effects of their power are equivalent to 167 cups of linden tea. Some achieve deep sleep before the 65th step. Their skin is said to be soft as cotton and Their gaze is hypnotizing and lulling. \nThose who have come out of the effect of their power after a three-day sleep cure say they feel as if they are coming back from a pleasant death.\nThe ritual to invoke them includes cardamom, Dramacuina Lacrimaria root and swamp water, among 87 other ingredients.\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmewa4YyTQMf7H6EntM2q1ZxFvTMT3BcUzv8E7K23mhMm2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmacRCT3mzcx1LgaPGHuLboZSnD6wUBVJBozsSWHBDPR9S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmewa4YyTQMf7H6EntM2q1ZxFvTMT3BcUzv8E7K23mhMm2", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["stamp", "Morondanga", "Peppo", "Harmony"], "extra": {}}
