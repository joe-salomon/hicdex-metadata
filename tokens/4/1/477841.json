The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\u2028\n~~~\n\u2028in my dream: I\u2019m at a seaport, waiting to board a train to New York. A man in a red jacket approaches me. He asks why I\u2019m looking for work. I tell him I\u2019m looking for work but I can\u2019t find it. I\u2019ve given up. I\u2019m discarded at the station. A woman checks my ticket. She asks why I still carry a twenty-two dollar bill. I tell her I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m stunned silence. Then she hands me a small booklet containing rules of engagement for a upcoming war with Afghanistan. I\u2019m told to read them and report to a firing squad immediately.\n\u2028~~~\n\u2028\nThe GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\u2028\nHumans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 14 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028\n[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYmAj6Ty7RjFJFa8CT5JGvCHpuz9vB2jKukr9MqKnYt9N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVZojqrVF5v21NbBdSyuC3EVxUd3CE4mth6St7UtJrnxL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYmAj6Ty7RjFJFa8CT5JGvCHpuz9vB2jKukr9MqKnYt9N", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
