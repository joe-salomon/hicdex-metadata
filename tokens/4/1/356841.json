Each NFT will be available as a 1/1 as a digital snapshot I have created from my own work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdAFLt7PfKe3WAG4NXy7aKPMvPEMK3jdausQG3Y9J9GGA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPSdVYpf8NHP7vhp77Q3as7u9Sb8RgpgSNnkyyyZy685v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdAFLt7PfKe3WAG4NXy7aKPMvPEMK3jdausQG3Y9J9GGA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ecKRfFyXBCuSfniEMYuU1vZPT6jJCr2aj"], "tags": ["nftphotography", "photography", "beach", "search", "digitalsnapshot"], "extra": {}}
