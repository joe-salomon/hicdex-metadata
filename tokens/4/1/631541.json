An independent metal band trying to record an album.\n\nThe song presented to you is 'Sexting', one of our favorites at the moment, and it's about having sex with robots. We recorded it at the vocalist's basement and we look foward to produce it in a professional studio. \n\nAll the funds raised here will be reverted to music and entertaiment. Please, consider suporting it. Much much love <3", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRjgxsXktgB9ECw4wRDCKpGexXjuE39A7DGMSohpkCiHf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ1FDUr9wvmNR7TkAJ5kmE6ya1rtYQcc9LZ97miR4fLgR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRjgxsXktgB9ECw4wRDCKpGexXjuE39A7DGMSohpkCiHf", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YdRRvmYbC5XcPqw4uobcbeTKZ2HHhEMDZ"], "tags": ["music", "metal", "independent", "undergroud", "brasil", "brazil", "saopaulo", "sp", "future", "robots", "sex", "porn", ""], "extra": {}}
