Variation and selection are key to the evolutionary process - small changes to the parameterisation of the equations dramatically change the resulting form, and its fitness in this specialised social media landscape. Aside the generating factors, the physical form is also subject to the randomness of pen, paper, plotter and pressure - both genetics and environment taking their parts in shaping the final outcome.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaynloqgx4q6ljr4hzw2iedskvagcu4ghsccwim656mgda7bdnhia", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiao67r2c57ofr4rqynkajwq3lx6bi7uroihxv3f3kra6gnrmyuomm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiaynloqgx4q6ljr4hzw2iedskvagcu4ghsccwim656mgda7bdnhia", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dhmUMLa3ZeVC3GJWfQty4VfgHdkd6xacQ"], "tags": ["nft", "nftcollector", "generativeart", "generative", "contemporaryart", "plotter", "axidraw", "cleannft", "nftart", "organicart", "hicetnunc2020"], "extra": {}}
