I am especially wary of my mom's sad experience, who passed away in 2009. But, of course, my parents gave me a lot of good too.\n\nI decided to try to repeat the photo of my parents on my birthday in order to compare us.\n\nMy husband and I gave our seven-year-old son a camera, showed what should be in the picture and tell what to do and we've got into the same pose.\n\nWhen the photo showed up, we laughed for a very long time. The experience is unrepeatable.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXG8fTZWtCZGnpAHWg8nu7HYhVf7nCUoWymv2fGDJWLto", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWZZBGftyZNY8MQwmqirXnx5tVrogwjy7RDiFNsm5SWCN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXG8fTZWtCZGnpAHWg8nu7HYhVf7nCUoWymv2fGDJWLto", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d5HE9dWCn6ciiSgLRvfegDiHyMUt6oo4w"], "tags": ["family", "diary", "polaroid"], "extra": {}}
