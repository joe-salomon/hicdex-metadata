{"__version": 1, "token_id": 529841, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Aquarium", "description": "With the Poisson/infinite-range interactions method, there's a tendency not to get sharply articulated structures but rather to get things that look like atomic orbitals, because there is no characteristic length-scale in the propagation of the field and scales only emerge from the neural network nonlinearities. An answer to that is to make it so that material can 'screen' the emitted field, allowing infinite-range interactions in the vacuum but obtaining characteristic scales where material is present. Here those screening effects lead to the formation of gliders with lots of internal structure and even internal motion, such as oscillating flagella or spinning cores. In the heart of the ocean near the end of the run, you can see the emergence of a replicating spot pattern. / @ngutten\n\n2560 x 1440 mp4\n11/11/21\nNicholas Guttenberg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNMEG5d1EFi1bcjaSW6nWivdLZcuQd8591fQVrP6qKSZ1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTs9VV6ZWgXc4GCnxvjCzsCC68LBMdMN6DEPXtrPhbVRG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNMEG5d1EFi1bcjaSW6nWivdLZcuQd8591fQVrP6qKSZ1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["video", "simulation", "generative", "gliders", "cellularautomaton", "artificiallife"], "extra": {}}
