Is something of computers, but not real life. \n\nDone in PaintingVR very hungry, a pretty cool canvas drawing VR app, where you can not make an undo, so mistake in a stroke, you die. Edited with Pixlr without any undo as well.\n\nIn a virtual world, I want the freedom to be able to be wrong, please PaintingVR support the undo and make feel awesome with your app! \n\nDiscord: DaniGA#9856\nhttps://github.com/DanielAbalde\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DanielAbaldeDesigner\nhttps://twitter.com/daniiga", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPGP12v3qRMJGmu9RDMxYov12Aeqmeku7sYiwvJwPczED", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb9QbNE6Loi3ZBTq27nPLEEjRyjibrdLZ3GCBeLLbm4y7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPGP12v3qRMJGmu9RDMxYov12Aeqmeku7sYiwvJwPczED", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2XD7TEHNk2xkURYDY9VAeg5cSmuk9PZQNp"], "tags": ["PaintingVR", "VR", "daniga"], "extra": {}}
