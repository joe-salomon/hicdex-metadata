The idea is simple: choose a creative project, do it every day for 100 days, and share your process online. \n\nEach \u201c100daysofpois\u201d or \u201cPois\u201d is an exploration between algorithmic and organic gesture. Each short motion is unique to the gesture that originated it. Created by Jean-Charles Amey using Processing. \n\nDiscover, collect, exchange the other 99 Pois in the collection #100daysofpois on H=N.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbewhNcpSr3tiuqB1fezgQ8FfTqBwb2dpARbW12M94vGY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbewhNcpSr3tiuqB1fezgQ8FfTqBwb2dpARbW12M94vGY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbewhNcpSr3tiuqB1fezgQ8FfTqBwb2dpARbW12M94vGY", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1h8cHNmJdFn7dCnsy8Whi6CiW4NkT7Qk4E"], "tags": ["organic", "generative", "creativecoding", "coding", "the100dayproject", "100daysofpois", "algo", "generativeart", "gesture", "sketch", "pois", "gif", "procecssing"], "extra": {}}
