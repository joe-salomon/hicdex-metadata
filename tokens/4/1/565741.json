It made me think of the innocence of children, their simplicity and purity not yet spoiled by adult's affairs. And also about the innocence of animals, and the treatment we give them as adults. It would be great if we could recover at least a bit of that innocence, and treat and love animals the same as children do.\n\nI hope you like it and thanks for your support!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYh1HJfH6wXgHWo8K1nSrbFMHkhG1cGh5kes3py9NwYBG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRvHMwhw5YZe9pAAfyJeDurRRdfJW5y82nXvERL1TbN11", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYh1HJfH6wXgHWo8K1nSrbFMHkhG1cGh5kes3py9NwYBG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Kpg28dcPNuUL4GKoHvEU3M3AQWH7jLEYP"], "tags": ["illustration", "child", "children", "nature", "play", "run", "joy", "duck", "grass", "trees"], "extra": {}}
