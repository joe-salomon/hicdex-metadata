The entirety of my revenue from the sale of this piece will be donated to The Lighthouse, Chez Doris, AGIR and Amazon Conservation Team. Created at the beginning of 2021, \u201cSymbiosis\u201d was a collaborative piece created with the help of my audience on Instagram. By choosing different options they were given, they ended up deciding what the piece would look like. I have been thinking of releasing \"Symbiosis\" as an NFT for a while, but considering the community-driven/collaborative effort behind the artwork, I figured it would be a great opportunity to seal that connection further and donate 100% of all the profits I\u2019d make from the sale to a noble cause. Therefore, I asked for my audience\u2019s input on whom I shall give the proceeds to. The most requested causes were: well-being of children, helping women in difficulty, helping marginalized groups and lastly, the Amazon Rainforest. Considering these causes, I chose these organizations: The Lighthouse, Chez Doris, AGIR and Amazon Conservation Team. The majority of the people also decided that we would split the funds equally between the different organizations.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZyRvjX4p4shAz2scywkHQXEJ8XPKb53bRQVFB78vQCtn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRSo93Kk6YCCDYqYM3G9d7hkZqhEHhFiRMfJFdTf6amqn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZyRvjX4p4shAz2scywkHQXEJ8XPKb53bRQVFB78vQCtn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZSPfcQiZzXrtYFXmhrkfL5xonJdYy1u9q"], "tags": ["3d", "3D", "3dart", "aeforia", "art", "avatar", "charity", "donation", "illustration", "montreal", "rare", "scifi", "superrare", "surreal", "surrealism"], "extra": {}}
