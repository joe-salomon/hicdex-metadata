(Art within Art within Art has a certain Inception-like quality to it.) There's 4 parts to a day, right? (Wait, what?) Sunrise/Sunset/Moonrise/Moonset. (but ummm during a new moon there is no moonrise or moonset)...doesn't mean the moon isn't there. So, for these four works, we have 3 gradient circles that have been somewhat blended together with three words directly underneath; all begin with either SUN or MOON. First we see the light, then the sun rises, and then it ascends. We have successfully completed the first movement.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPfRHNjRP5HkSc8eD6cHLLLsYpjnWUzfsDHWGA9stwhzU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPYuCHdWUpeZKug9C3qzQML8LNGcginga7gT5gVUxJetz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPfRHNjRP5HkSc8eD6cHLLLsYpjnWUzfsDHWGA9stwhzU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
