In the Space Restricted Artifacts series, the process of applying multiple lines to form a kind of topographical illusion is almost reversed, when the thickness of the line overwhelms the space between them. The focus becomes a way of depicting light and shadow, rather than topography. \n\nA human attempting to mimic a machine mimicking an organism and ending in purgatory.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicqoz43chgn5mqi55g74sdpmijugqhhyetcnwfltrwo5w5w5zk27a", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibmj2d4qulbqgiwnsbbbdfmdeiqlmoismiubsdhkigr4d6vla3req", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicqoz43chgn5mqi55g74sdpmijugqhhyetcnwfltrwo5w5w5zk27a", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "light", "shadow", "genart", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
