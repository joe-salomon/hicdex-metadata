In any arts festival ANYWHERE actually. But this was extra cool because I\u2019m in Amsterdam and it was in NZ. So today for my STOREEZ I painted a still from the glitched video. \n\nIn this moment a man is falling and being split into a million pieces while people watch on. He\u2019s going to be caught so it\u2019s ok. \n\nPersonal daily art story\nNumber 17 #STOREEZ by Cat Brown/ Treasvre Trove ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma7LqkxYoQ4mrJ4fwy4xtRDPj17vZxhA2vP2CscX2EemN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSGZEhsRq8ZBquQiFRydhRYQQr94QjsPFBTedx45zuB12", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma7LqkxYoQ4mrJ4fwy4xtRDPj17vZxhA2vP2CscX2EemN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Xu1CazAffNXnBZcgA23nt8QbvP44LLxGh"], "tags": ["STOREEZ", "painting", "painted", "glitch", "TreasvreTrove", "catbrown"], "extra": {}}
