Sometimes it is difficult to guess when we remember in childhood, the house of our grandmother, or our aunt.\nMaybe it was just a few plants, one or another evergreen.\nBut for us it was a jungle, a green mystery, a lost paradise.\n\nThat pet we prefer, its soft fur, which we caressed. What was our company when with our friends we played dolls and drank an invisible tea, but as tasty as the one that the March hare served to Alicia.\n\nOr when with our friends, we planned adventures, and the cat frowned when we climbed on the table and pretended to be pirates.\n\nThat garden of our childhood is today a lost paradise.\nSometimes we can stop before paintings like this and discover that what we thought was lost is still inside us. The Paradiso perduto. We carry it inside, and we spend our lives looking for it outside.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibt6j7xrlbjmdfa6ruaxikoxdktpqjf65uccetoiwgrz7c3adr2vq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiha3ka4y5g7n7njd7srdbebnvt54geesb3yimdeausxtxtzp4ftsy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeibt6j7xrlbjmdfa6ruaxikoxdktpqjf65uccetoiwgrz7c3adr2vq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZryT4fmy97uV39Vq8VbSNmtqstUgLXiTq"], "tags": ["illustration", "traditional", "acrylic", "2DArt", "oldtimes", "oleo", "watercolour", "drawing", "art", "objkt4objkt"], "extra": {}}
