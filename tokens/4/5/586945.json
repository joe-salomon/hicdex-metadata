{"__version": 1, "token_id": 586945, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SNOWSHOES", "description": "Oh good we're out of the science loop there. In little doses we can learn a lot. (or if I'm wrong, then unlearn a lot) Something great about learning is being able to see within seeing. Sounds pretentious? You bet, but there's a truth to it. Let's look at the word SNOWSHOES. Looks like a completely random word to choose, but look inside of it. What do we see? As you've seen with other similar static syntax crystals on previous pages, there are complete words within the word and we don't even have to move the letters around like an anagram. The narrative is jabberwocky; devoid of any particular meaning, and an extreme example of visual semantic abstraction. What we are left with is another layer of the malleability of English and the almost quantum-like possibilities that simultaneously occur with or without our observation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme7oAArovd7Bdaf9bfGjSDCKgUgZLEWXgnqDYV35bUXEe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUpfxoTHyieJRn1JqnpZ6U9Acbi65zoCM4BB6cMmuMFbE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme7oAArovd7Bdaf9bfGjSDCKgUgZLEWXgnqDYV35bUXEe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
