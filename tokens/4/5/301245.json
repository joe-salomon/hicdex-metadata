(Digital sculpture/digital painting - 16000 x 11200px) \n\nCreated to honour the strange bravery and fringe mindsets of fight sport athletes. Here, Michael \u201c2 Guns\u201d Younis and Scott \u201cThe Bear\u201d Trelford contest an amateur MMA bout at GTFP Fight Night 3 in Wolverhampton, UK, in 2016. Younis won by TKO (punches) after 1 minute of the first round.\n\nThe piece is part of an ongoing series on the extremes of human existence, parallel to an aesthetic investigation into reality vs unreality as a shifting analogy of quantum systems. \n\n25% of proceeds will be donated to the UK-based mental health charity Mind.\n\n[ T : @MindCharity ]\n\n[ T : @guyswily / W : wilyguys.com / I : @wilyguys / M : wilyguys.medium.com ]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihh3kiwnk2o3xraxntfti6l62az5xu66bsvu2vuaq7p7jux2a7jea", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidkxkv7kx2pqclyyq6kwqd5i4xa5w2ngdtyubrd2mtaezof74sjye", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://bafybeihh3kiwnk2o3xraxntfti6l62az5xu66bsvu2vuaq7p7jux2a7jea"}], "creators": ["tz1Zy776w4Br4asmH2Z9FNdUUHiZ4Gwbo4ok"], "tags": ["fighting", "mma", "loneliness", "mentalhealth", "boxing", "portrait", "painting", "digitalpainting", "digitalart", "sculpture", "digitalsculpture", ""], "extra": {}}
