The coating particles completely isolate the interior liquids from the surrounding environment, thus conveniently encapsulating the reactions. Great efforts have been made over the past decade to demonstrate the feasibility of liquid marble-based microreactors for chemical and biological applications. This review systemically summarises state-of-the-art implementations of liquid marbles as microreactors. This paper also discusses the various aspects of liquid marble-based microreactors, such as the formation, manipulation, and future perspectives.\n\nThis casual muscle tank is soft to the touch with a drapey hand. The easy shape covers the hip and features deep armholes for style and comfort. Perfect for layering with your favorite crop or tank.\n\nArtwork details: abstract, digital, pattern, Halloween Night Retro", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP4GQAZThJZF9EmKWfnK8BzD78qju1MWo35w664W6w1MR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZHhfcxRE8pbeVeUutuNDTkfzGLa5y1rfFKMhtWMhF8r3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP4GQAZThJZF9EmKWfnK8BzD78qju1MWo35w664W6w1MR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WRJBxL89qSEbzHKrLERdTVa8YNQirpbvj"], "tags": ["Halloween", "LiquidMarble", "Abstract", "Retro"], "extra": {}}
