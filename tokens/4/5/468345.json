I make black and white artworks since I know comics. I choose black and white because I always want to remember the moments few years ago when I started make comics that were produced by photocopy and distribute independently by put it in local shops. And it's sold out. People loves it. That feelings made me fell in love in making comics until now. The reason I using myself as main character is because I try to love myself more, be happy for what I have. And I always believed that loving yourself is one way to be more grateful and live a happier life.
