During my work on SPACER COLONIES and OUTSKIRTS, I got fascinated by the relationship and evolution between input patterns/textures and the AI-imagined output.\n\nEDELSTEINGARTEN explores that relationship by letting a gan imagine mineral and gemstone 'gardens' over various input patterns/textures. In some works, visualisations of that relationship are integrated in the piece itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSz8p3iKWKGuvxamQdr96QT3DLZM2v1sH4VPrvCagUAnq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSz8p3iKWKGuvxamQdr96QT3DLZM2v1sH4VPrvCagUAnq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSz8p3iKWKGuvxamQdr96QT3DLZM2v1sH4VPrvCagUAnq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1M5pswUdqFNoMH3NAtF2W9GCwdLx1ZiWUV"], "tags": ["ai", "generative", "artificialintelligence", "gan", "abstract", "texture", "experimental"], "extra": {}}
