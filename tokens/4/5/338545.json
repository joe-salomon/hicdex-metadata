She has several superpowers like talking with the dead, entering people's dream, and healing the wound, but every time she uses that power, she becomes sick after, its like the consequences from the God... Her real name is Shiragiku, which means \"white chrysanthemum\" and since she is found amnesia, Shin and Hibiki give her a name \"Hotaru\" which means fireflies. The ancient belief said if the twins of deity are born, one of them must be killed unless they will give a bad karma, but they both survived by their mom. Later on, Kugyou and Hotaru have to choose...
