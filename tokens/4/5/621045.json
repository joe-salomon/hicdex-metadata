There\u2019ll be 12 artworks in total from 6 different continents.\n\nThis time, I got inspired by a famous folk tale from Denmark: Thumbelina. The tale was about a thumb-sized girl born of a flower. The original story told that Thumbelina had a long journey before she finally met her Little Prince.\n\nOne of the sequences that I love the most is when she was kidnapped by the marriage-minded toad who madly wanted her to marry the ugly toad junior (which she refused). So I tried to recreate the scene by adding modern touch in it. I replaced the toad junior with the iconic pepe and changed the setting from a swamp to a modern bathtub with a falling star took place outside (don't ask me why, I just feel like it).\n\nYou should read the whole story as it contains a very good message about staying true, honesty, and kindness. Thumbelina didn't hurt anybody and helped the needy instead. So in the end, she got her prize and lived a happy life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdLbhz3YQz973b7vnk4MPeGoCNsRxdSJ5jXunThE74qr8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUjNdNkdSUqyHrzrLUS4zzJctDmQtYdiAQmZ7MoDGpBtJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdLbhz3YQz973b7vnk4MPeGoCNsRxdSJ5jXunThE74qr8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PdGThHGV3Dj96b7nkeJ6KxPf8x9sZjyP9"], "tags": ["folktales", "thumbelina", "digitalillustration", "story", "ichacho", "pepe"], "extra": {}}
