{"__version": 1, "token_id": 567445, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Within", "description": "- Animation by Pandagunda - Sound by Jonsi - \"Within\" portrays the good stuff that can come out of the body, if we let it. The figurehead is still. He\u2019s observing, or meditating, the stillness in ourselves, calming down the noise and thoughts and chatter in our heads, to let out the raw, clean emotions that are submerged inside ourselves, buried by anxiety, fear and self-loathing, which pour out of the statue as it cracks open. The sound ( designed by Jonsi ) is another layer, to elevate and strengthen the shapes bursting out of the head. When I\u2019m deep in meditation, I try to imagine the burst of love and positive feelings coming out of my body taking over the accumulated stress and agony of our everyday responsibilities. I believe our souls need to be cleaned every day just like we take a shower every day when we woke up without even thinking about it.
