Mara is a 54 year old Asian elephant that was born in India and lived most of her life in captivity. When the Rodas Circus went bankrupt in 1995 she was taken to the former zoo of Buenos Aires, now Ecoparque where she lived with two African elephants that are still there. \nThe former zoo is one of the oldest original Victorian zoos in the world. The elephant enclosure known as the Hindu temple of Elephants was built in 1904 as a replica of the Hindu Temple of Elephants in Bombay.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVtavisLhBdMFUJVr7E9PmZ12UQZspCsnBdQSQ7N85QdQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSLiXnHqrAfrrhq2yKieguShNSmBwbJumQEp123c4CHhF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVtavisLhBdMFUJVr7E9PmZ12UQZspCsnBdQSQ7N85QdQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aLNxZRWrSKqPwiEbxPrLTr3tHWG5c1rD5"], "tags": ["photography", "elephant", "nature", "freedom"], "extra": {}}
