It\u2019s portraying someone who\u2019s bold. She\u2019s staring at the viewer in a daring way. This illustration captures the power and confidence of the person portrayed, as well as her roughness and sharp edges. \nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdViuvTcCnKosfqJCtwtUq8XKZizoLgLjUjEiRwVHrfqq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUyqqALG9zhbNwUo6h3Ccgb9oaTU6BufZc8untSdh2UjU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdViuvTcCnKosfqJCtwtUq8XKZizoLgLjUjEiRwVHrfqq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "feelings", "power", "confidence"], "extra": {}}
