Drawn from all species, the flock travels through the seven valleys: quest, love, understanding, detachment, unity, amazement, and death. The birds that endure reach the mountain to learn a profound lesson: that Simorgh the king is, in fact, each of them and all of them. A lyrical and richly illustrated story of love, faith, and the beauty of the human journey.\n- the conference of the birds\n\n//SERIES\nIGNIS | FIRE\nFATUUS | FOOLISH\n\nMEANING | \"FOOLISH FIRE\"\n ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcj3GERg1csJb2GBgDpNqAaW5FhCPv5bDZUiQA58WhWHo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWe5aqEBWs1Y5uAZfS3DYyBUANryJgVaQ5cvpRzPavcu2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcj3GERg1csJb2GBgDpNqAaW5FhCPv5bDZUiQA58WhWHo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1g8t7w4b8Nu6ikxvJybKRjAvx5m1mhpJ8S"], "tags": ["photography", "reflections", "mirrors", "love", "oneness", "silences", "visuals", "black", "white", "hicetnunc", "hen", "monochrome"], "extra": {}}
