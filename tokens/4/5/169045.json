{"__version": 1, "token_id": 169045, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Elder Thing", "description": "Six feet end to end, three and five-tenths feet central diameter, tapering to one foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths \u2013 combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans. . . which gives almost seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth, especially fabled Elder Things in the Necronomicon.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTTodGxLiGYFGwsaxCSmQm4MToXNnEaFWZmiKGEAsbKuR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTTodGxLiGYFGwsaxCSmQm4MToXNnEaFWZmiKGEAsbKuR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTTodGxLiGYFGwsaxCSmQm4MToXNnEaFWZmiKGEAsbKuR", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TQ2hkcHcQVM9LHJNNXj8AFcKBvMHcXVC4"], "tags": ["lovecraft", "aiart", "vqgan", "clip"], "extra": {}}
