When one fails on the first try, somehow the failure is a gift, something that we might collect, to recall what made us a failure. We love arts, not because of the stunning and gorgeous looks of an artwork, but sometimes it\u2019s the process behind it. \n\nTrials and errors are the debt we have to pay, the very risk of learning something rather subjective and unmeasurable. We emphasize the world by how experiences brought us here today, it constructs our point of view, our perspective of seeing the world. Just like colors, sometimes it was made from failed attempts, and sometimes it was a successful one. \n\nLocation: Bandung, Indonesia\nDate of capture: December 2018\nSize: 13.6MB\nDevice: Canon EOS 80D, 18-135mm Lens\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYv27kwEx52thrNubPFtPtTr2xLb2PAvtVWsTfvCQeL62", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNQeKDAVabs6mp61ej4BMcX4yq3wP7hWzve9AhQFN1w6H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYv27kwEx52thrNubPFtPtTr2xLb2PAvtVWsTfvCQeL62", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1feWSMBdi8jZ5Lcg2ukoA4wtm35Apx21Zx"], "tags": ["colors", "poster", "paint", "illustrations", "art", "photography", "mood", "red", "creativity", ""], "extra": {}}
