It became the exclusive religion of this country by a decree of King Filomenus*, at the time of the monarchy. It is said that the king, under the effects of the vapors of The Night of the Frogs**, saw various creatures who appeared before him and asked to be honored under strange rituals or else the country would burn in flames. \n\nPeppos are hermaphrodite beings that live in swampy areas. One of them is Peppo of Abundance. This Peppo is silent and sneaky, but when the ritual that honors them is performed correctly, they give a lot of abundance and prosperity.\n\nThe magician and conjurer Calixto, in charge of transcribing the deliriums of King Filomenus that Night of the Frogs when the Peppos appeared, wrote on the side of the sheet: \"Filomenus seems absorbed in his thoughts. He has been rambling for a long time and seems to be having a very long conversation with invisible entities. He says: \"One of them is green, my friend. One of them is green and his gaze is terrible and yellow like a sunset seen from a glass jar\".\n\n* See OBJKT #439879\n** See OBJKT #245972\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWgcfNmQMgR6NWKVz7hVtm1Q3jhsAD5GAQsvhSeKWdWd3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS4mUzJ6vXs5QBxdtcjP1GUrbLuYPh5DDSAASCyLCdKp5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWgcfNmQMgR6NWKVz7hVtm1Q3jhsAD5GAQsvhSeKWdWd3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Peppos"], "extra": {}}
