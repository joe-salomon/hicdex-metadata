I love the big and flowing skirts that he always features in his paintings of the dancers. After doing the sketch, I didn't really know what to do for the background, until my little brother called me to show me the sky outside that afternoon. There were static, sun-lit clouds in the background, with much larger and darker clouds rolling over them, revealing only glimpses of the sky behind. I wanted to capture the beautiful and epic feeling that the view gave that day.\n\nThis piece was digitally painted and animated by me. You can see some of the sketches and processes on my Twitter account (@I_am_Sphere).\n\nVideo Length: 12 seconds\n\nFrames per second: 24 fps\n\n{2300x3450}\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb7wkez789u34JJhRWc6C2n1QHURTGqL4ZX6hdA3na8j2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZe8tLV7D3fYRsteSvzyGQgtTYsxLNN2jmCf43s4vispq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb7wkez789u34JJhRWc6C2n1QHURTGqL4ZX6hdA3na8j2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YUVJLYpxehCQskw5LJTY8oQNuX6Q4w6tw"], "tags": ["Night", "stars", "pink", "colourful", "ballet", "dance", "dancer", "girl", "woman", "colorful", "realism", "epic", ""], "extra": {}}
