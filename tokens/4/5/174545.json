The work focuses on the conflict a lot of these groups face on a daily trying to live a life of peace. Rivalries with neighbouring tribes, drought and being forced from their lands are just a few of their issues. Collectors of this objkt will receive the mp3 file of the song.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUwbHXcq29hfYKQP3hWzQoVrJ1xrjJxqn9BmUnmamSnQe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWhcM7Docmfh19cQR4ZenfwowLwBSuTqtaN944vwF9nGw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUwbHXcq29hfYKQP3hWzQoVrJ1xrjJxqn9BmUnmamSnQe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LHVgEVguxmHGGQvjbrK3Rc4YXuFgqh966"], "tags": ["illustration", "indigenous", "omo", "valley", "ethiopia", "tribal", "africa", "peace", "conflict", "nature"], "extra": {}}
