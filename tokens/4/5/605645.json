{"__version": 1, "token_id": 605645, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Memento of Creation", "description": "After a decade-long hiatus from making art, I've been slowly getting back into creating pieces, mainly in the digital realm this time around.\n\nWhat really ignited my spark again was the realization of a digital renaissance through NFTs, blockchain technology, and DeFi.\n\nThe artist no longer has to rely on a middle man exploiting them and paying them peanuts after taking a huge cut out of any sales.\n\nAfter messing around with a few pieces here and there and dipping my toes into the NFT world and learning how the community and space operate, I realized that I'm not doing myself justice by the pieces I created in the last month.\n\nI enjoyed the creative process of making those pieces, but I know that I am better than that. I can create more beautifully than that. I will create better than my previous piece, every time. I will push myself harder and harder to be better at what I do.\n\nI will also help raise up other artists trying to be better at what they do. This isn't a competition. This is a community and I want to be the best that I can be to help support others to be the best that they can be.\n\nThis piece is a memento to remind me of this moment where my creative energy is building up and getting ready to be released. I can sense amazing things coming in 2022 and beyond!\n\nPlease enjoy this video loop in full screen and with headphones on for the best experience.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQjbdaBbkYkwb8LPsFPH7EuCctPoL8srdHTD9jfyZLw7M", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTHJt9fnzHhvBtEp2wFUWHMjWLe8ZQK8g45BQ34jWyq36", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQjbdaBbkYkwb8LPsFPH7EuCctPoL8srdHTD9jfyZLw7M", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Suvzs89rnXh97Aua91XZwVDbBf5i37DcB"], "tags": ["surreal", "abstract", "primordial", "glow", "energy", "creativity", "sparks", "electric", "birth", "cloud", "storm"], "extra": {}}
