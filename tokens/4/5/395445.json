This work is an abstract representation of the Australian landscape. The colour palette of this work was directly inspired by the 2019 summer bushfires, both during the disaster, as well as post disaster recovery by the end of 2020. The video is a digitally manipulated representation of a traditionally executed synthetic polymer on canvas painting, accompanied with a musical composition by James Andrews (Hoon & Tuff Mustard). The digital works expand beyond the possibilities of traditional painting, forming new experiences for the viewer that extend the art gallery type experience.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV5dD2Bj2N9tWJ2dMzAakP3Ttf4H2njZRwQYNFTT8x8Zj", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcoj4Ju8rCPMRe4DBkJdNrH4RmdVzeLwipsGgLQGZfzA9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV5dD2Bj2N9tWJ2dMzAakP3Ttf4H2njZRwQYNFTT8x8Zj", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XmF6zXM9a4LVZSPqNWQn665pxvj6ZL8sh"], "tags": ["#PRV2", "#EyeJack", ""], "extra": {}}
