I have to stack the colors from light to dark and I also have to wait for the previous color to dry first. This painting tells of a swan and a turtle who are experiencing a dry season and it is difficult for them to survive. so they started planning to move to the lake under the foot of the mountain. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb9275NTzZoZyAuo9CU7rMkyyhdiFnihoVb28nNVKabcD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPKDu92RYXrJK8hgXFfRpYShJYxxwUJDoZbA3R9TGo1YS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmU4Y3XMgBDJFjftv9cfuHjbeYmUj5JFD8UAzj7W3YJcNv", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb9275NTzZoZyAuo9CU7rMkyyhdiFnihoVb28nNVKabcD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Q1qNYnWexc8Hg5kCwFkdabYQmCKBNTqbs"], "tags": ["painting", "indonesia", "javanese", "artwork", "nftart", "nature", "art", "turtle", "traditional", "swan"], "extra": {}}
