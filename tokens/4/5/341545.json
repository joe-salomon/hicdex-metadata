This convention continues for all sequences by the same pattern, whereas the start frequency is fixed arbitrarily and only follows the law of successive addition. For the visual translation, the sinusoidal waveform is abstracted with parameterized principles and transferred along the formal concept. The increasing complexity gets visible and the prevailing simplicity at the beginning inverted by the end. The audio-visual arrangement references and illustrates especially over time the complexity and increasing compression of the original shape.\n\nIncludes international shipping in a roll-shaped packaging (no picture frame included).
