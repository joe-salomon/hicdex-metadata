Circumstances, time, or distances are not an obstacle for this thread. As time passes, the thread begins to shorten until these two meet. The thread may stretch or squeeze but it does not tear.\n\nA human's life is a thread and he himself is part of a large ornament with many knots. Threads connect humans' destinies and pass-through from the past to the future.\n\nThis series was published in the printed version of the Rebel Magazine (october 2021).\n\n\u2726\u2726\u2726\n\nSaint Petersburg / Russia / 2021\n\nThis is 1159 x 1500.
