The gospel tells us that a bright star appeared in the eastern sky when Jesus was born, famously seen by a group of wise men. These biblical \"Magi,\" sometimes called kings, now adorn nativity scenes around the world.\"\n\n\nWhen I was 5 years old, I remember being the star of a play in a Christmas event. No, I wasn't the main character. I was literally a star.\n\n\nI have no idea if you believe in the bible or if you're religious, but I really like the symbolism of the star. The brightest star represents hope. Hope that will lead you to the path you must take to be where you should be.\n\nI hope you find your own star. And if you ever do, I hope you never lose sight of it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdSy1sZqvPAYR5D2J7NZLmbA5gzFvhoEyu9BneB1MJ75e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdSy1sZqvPAYR5D2J7NZLmbA5gzFvhoEyu9BneB1MJ75e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmdSy1sZqvPAYR5D2J7NZLmbA5gzFvhoEyu9BneB1MJ75e", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdSy1sZqvPAYR5D2J7NZLmbA5gzFvhoEyu9BneB1MJ75e", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cahW4TVbYZQ1WCzDFiXr8PcGQcvCWcpa9"], "tags": ["christmas", "star", "stainedglass"], "extra": {}}
