Needless to say that I was extremely happy with the final result! Also, here's a little backstory, this person is actually my ex. Good thing that we're still friends or this photo could've met a less positive fate.\n\nFunny enough, I also noticed that I have a bad habit of avoiding eye contact when I talk to people. Thank you anxiety lol.\n\n4x6\nAnalogue camera\nblack and white 35mm film", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdfZ3m6hcHH5pDBwDMo4QsQN6GVZDZBXW5cHS8C2ph5xi", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd83j7NPugQvrBSnGDLE5SJ3rwCkfqv9KdeN5wuJuLoK8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdfZ3m6hcHH5pDBwDMo4QsQN6GVZDZBXW5cHS8C2ph5xi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cT16W1udTSn6EjKHdk1y11pp25eqa6aRs"], "tags": ["photez", "blackandwhite", "camera", "collection", "serie", "photo", "photography", "analoge", "35mmfilm"], "extra": {}}
