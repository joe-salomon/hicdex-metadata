Their (our) eyes constantly staring at the screen with the contents provided in a large numbers from the internet. They're (we're) lulled by the information and images presented, sometimes they (we) get carried away even enchanted to participate and record the(our)selves or each other. Their (our) eyes are forced to see things we don't even want to see. Just like the Ludovico Technique, which is the name given to the aversion therapy Alex (A Clockwork Orange - Stanley Kubrick's) is subjected to. This technique requires the subject to be strapped into a chair with their eyes held open while watching moving images and films of violence under the influence of a purposely developed drug; called CRM 114, which is a reference to Kubrick's past film Dr. Strangelove. Yes, we are the victim of a malpractice of Ludovico technique.
