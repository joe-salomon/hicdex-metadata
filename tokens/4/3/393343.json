How the heck is this art? As a species, we have a nasty tendency to look into the metaphorical backyards of our neighbors/friends/everyone and compare our lot in life and theirs. Oh...so and so has \"x\" amount of money or \"x\" amount of success or \"x\" amount whatever variable you can throw in to compare. Living life like this is just poison for your heart and soul. We do this because it is in our nature. As humans our brains are programmed to create stories and connect the dots intuitively to figure out complex situations. We create comparisons based upon perceived assumptions of the world. We're constantly scanning our environment to make judgements every moment. In doing so, these assumptions cause us sometimes to have feelings of insecurity or a feeling of lacking. When you stop looking at what other people have as a means to guide your life's journey, you immediately break free of the cycle and begin to see bigger systems at play. Let go of the jealousy. Replace it with acceptance and love.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZTervkPyVbe4MsgWef3tAi8YWjht8MA1NEYCWXLhsQWg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU4v4zfv5tu6keiCnvsnioer2Xj5cemp7pu7G8pg4rxdn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZTervkPyVbe4MsgWef3tAi8YWjht8MA1NEYCWXLhsQWg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
