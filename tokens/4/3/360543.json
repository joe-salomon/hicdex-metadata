In the midst of a watercolor wash, I dropped my sketchbook, and a mess resulted. I let it dry, took a deep breath, and created something new out of the disaster that had been made. The challenge was fun, and different, and started a long experiment of many intentional disaster doodles that pressed my ability to think creatively and intuitively about my work. This series in 2020 fostered so much growth in my abilities as an artist, and this piece is pivotal in that journey.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXhuey3gQF6EA5BJn4Cinp6Y6afeHhoh6qGZtcXmHgFJy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXhuey3gQF6EA5BJn4Cinp6Y6afeHhoh6qGZtcXmHgFJy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXhuey3gQF6EA5BJn4Cinp6Y6afeHhoh6qGZtcXmHgFJy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PNyCU1phqT2tkojpPLuo4UTZqvDsGSsPt"], "tags": ["disaster", "mistake", "doodle", "sketch", "experiment", "portrait", "woman", "beautiful"], "extra": {}}
