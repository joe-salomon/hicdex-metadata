He is the giver of life and who sends light into the worlds. The One who resurrects His slaves after death for reward and/or punishment.\n\nAnd it is He who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day. Then He revives you therein that a specified term may be fulfilled. Then to Him will be your return; then He will inform you about what you used to do. (Quran 6:60)\n\n And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth \u2013 that He may recompense those who do evil with [the penalty of] what they have done and recompense those who do good with the best [reward]. (Quran 53:31)\n\nAnd [that they may know] that the Hour is coming \u2013 no doubt about it \u2013 and that Allah will resurrect those in the graves.
