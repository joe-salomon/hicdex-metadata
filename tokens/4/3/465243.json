His reality is too great to be fully understood under the capacity of the human mind. He is infinitely greater than his creation. It is said his throne (symbolic of his knowledge and authority) extends over the heavens and the earth, and the care of them burdens Him not, He is the Supreme, the Greatest.\n\nSo, exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great. (Quran 56:96)\n\nHe knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great. (Quran 2:255)\n\nTo Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.
