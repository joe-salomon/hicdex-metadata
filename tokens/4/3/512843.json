There is no place he can't reach, join his adventures through space!\n\n\"This was a collaboration with Lucasoxx, one of the most trippy and mesmerizing artists on HEN, who I also consider one of the most knowledgeable people about this platform, as well as NFT in general.  It's always a pleasure to hear his opinion about everything that happens in this community we are all building.\n\n \nWell, it wasn't easy to teach Lucaimoxx advanced physics to learn how to use his portal... We also had to give him a little stick to push the buttons, since his paws were too big.\n\n\nHe loved the glasses, we gave them to him as a reward for his efforts after so many hours of study and simulation.\n\n\nGo check out Lucasoxx's work at HEN, he has a whole series of portals and amoebas animated with digital video synthesizers. I find his creative process to be one of the most interesting on this platform, you won't regret taking the time to appreciate his work.\"\n\n\nTWITTER: @lucasoxx_\n\nHEN PROFILES: lucasoxx\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTgFzAq8f72a6bpwDehx4qdcwmqSswxkNrGUpJQ8QRcAC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTgFzAq8f72a6bpwDehx4qdcwmqSswxkNrGUpJQ8QRcAC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTgFzAq8f72a6bpwDehx4qdcwmqSswxkNrGUpJQ8QRcAC", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1bVAmmj5cK4s5SAMJFPWieFeTozMiZydJE"], "tags": ["illustration", "cute", "metaverseedition", "gif", "lucasoxx", "portal", "baimo", "envelstein", "collab", "HEN500"], "extra": {}}
