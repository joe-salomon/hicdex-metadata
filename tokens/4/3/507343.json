All we really know is that we are born, we live, and then we die. What happens afterwards as previously stated in other works, is wild speculation. It's only human to want to live another moment, another minute, another hour, another day. We have lives to live, we have love to give. We have things to do, we have people to view. We have stories to write, we have justice to fight. We have hope to spread, we have death to dread. It's all there; all of it. Just for one more moment we tell ourselves. We lie and say, \"this isn't/can't be\" the end.
