{"__version": 1, "token_id": 627443, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "R-U-N", "description": "ARE YOU IN, is another type of syntax experiment, but this one is based on how phonetics mixes with meaning. Call it a homophone sentence if you want. When we read the short top sentence, ARE YOU IN?, it corresponds with the specific letters, R U N, directly underneath. So not only do both top and bottom sound exactly the same, but we can use the bottom as a way to answer the top line's question. Top line is asking if you are in, (in where...we don't know) and the letters R U N, spell out RUN, which implies some other activity that we are not privy to in the conversation. Is this a random causality within the English language? Probably. Is it interesting to have a question that technically answers itself just from the sheer virtue of the phonetics? Absolutely.
