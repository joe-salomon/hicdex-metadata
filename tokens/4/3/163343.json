One can argue that Thanatos or Death is a part of the cycle of life; after destruction comes re-construction and that after the demise of the person, the idea, or the emotion springs forth the genesis of something better. Thanatos reminds us that we should not fear death but instead greet it as an old friend.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV1ywt5xeWhCsi9vgi45PZEQKLpzsX8FQZBJLCGzVtvX6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdfHawWdm15tQhxuL4yP9WguEgqEDiDRnn4RSy69ksMSZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV1ywt5xeWhCsi9vgi45PZEQKLpzsX8FQZBJLCGzVtvX6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SEb9ia5yX6QjbakkcWh2jg13UbWnC6Xmk"], "tags": ["death", "trippy", "psychedelic", "skull", "doodle", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
