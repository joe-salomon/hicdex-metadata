The embodiment of the network is often physical or informational. An entropy network is composed of entropy containers which are often called nodes, elements, features, or regions and entropy transfer occurs between containers. The transfer of entropy in networks was characterized by Schreiber[3] in his transfer entropy.  - Wikipedia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRMCbcgVbmV3sztcHiZDYaSbxr9zRKmhrfe7yGGBboMpQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRMCbcgVbmV3sztcHiZDYaSbxr9zRKmhrfe7yGGBboMpQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRMCbcgVbmV3sztcHiZDYaSbxr9zRKmhrfe7yGGBboMpQ", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt"], "tags": ["wheel_of_fortune"], "extra": {}}
