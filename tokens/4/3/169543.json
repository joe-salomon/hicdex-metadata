This sublime improvise gave us the glimpse of what wold become Os\u00edris, song that i wrote later with my best friend Caio C\u00e9sar, and that will be present in the first album (RITUS MOVEDISSUS) of Em agosto chove's project. Since here this song got a stronger, special and beauty version in studio, but this simple record into nature have an inestimable value, and marks an decisive moment into our artistic journey. This is the last piece of my first collection: Nature Ambience, recorded at 2020.
