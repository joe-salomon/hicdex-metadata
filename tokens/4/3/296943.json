She induced cardiac arrest in patients by injecting their intravenous therapy bags with massive doses of epinephrine, an untraceable heart stimulant. She would then respond to the coded emergency, often resuscitating the patients herself. Although it is believed that she may have been responsible for 350 or more deaths, her only confirmed victims were Stanley Jagodowski, Henry Hudon, Kenneth Cutting, and Edward Skwira.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicq6dc2sq5bjxilv6xigttnz7ch6a6ne3u3juakhorboued6hvpea", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicyr2e4ogkvaepfaomchminzgj363g26l3dp47x6huyq75lp33isq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicq6dc2sq5bjxilv6xigttnz7ch6a6ne3u3juakhorboued6hvpea", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["Collage", "theartofmann", "skull", "darkart", "surreal", "serial", "killer", "nurse"], "extra": {}}
