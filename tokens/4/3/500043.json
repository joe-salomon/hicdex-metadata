{"__version": 1, "token_id": 500043, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "GPTSD - The Human / Machine Feedback Loop (Dreamer 176)", "description": "Can trauma transfer from human to machine to human?\n\u2028\nGPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer is an open-source neural network (machine learning) model trained on internet data to generate new unique text.\n\n\u2028PTSD: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a mental disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, child abuse, or other threats.\n\n\u2028This series of text and images function as an exploratory case study that magnifies the risks of transferring human bias and trauma to machine learning models. The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: I\u2019m standing at the top of a flight of stairs. My left shoe clatters to the ground. Someone yells, \u201cStop! Stop!\u201d I reach down, try to push back, but somehow I\u2019m trapped in this extended pose, where I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to fall or not. Then a fellow behind me calls to me. It\u2019s Michael, my former roommate, who duped me twice. At first promising him I would tell the pilot I had some medical reason not to fly. But I\u2019m powerless against him. Once they continue to talk, I say to them, \u201cOK, I\u2019m dropping this,\u2019 and quickly do so. Just then the pilot emerges from an open galley, emerges twice, paces the third time, then quickly goes from our vicinity, circling the building in front of us like a fighter jet. We must press forward; we have no choice. We are trapped.\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 176 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZB5pvg4EmbVmukA7inH2G9rUeq9oNrpVGg4ka48BFr44", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZFFHcnvJTK7WK7h6qgbYKXEYCWfWsP21b7ofSMAbGcU4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZB5pvg4EmbVmukA7inH2G9rUeq9oNrpVGg4ka48BFr44", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
