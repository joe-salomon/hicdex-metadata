This is a series of 100 NFTs over 100 days, all broken screens, all 1/1!  I don\u2019t know if this will be successful, but I\u2019m inspired by the idea of working on art daily in order to build momentum.  I have shelves of broken screens I have collected, so this will be a way to force myself to photograph them.\n\nTo provide context for the images, I will occasionally post ancillary photos of the broken devices involved on Twitter (@rdklinc).  I will mint on a daily basis and at a random time.  \n\nI generally avoid apps and effects, using only minor color correction, and I often put my own photography behind the broken screens to bring out the colors.  Please see my Instagram (@rdklinc) for a more comprehensive collection of my work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUgtNWdBMmtpmEVdTgnDeb8EqhHc9zhyCgyWyoupPqVgs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmegdHTWe98uEvrpxyT4NVZnWNvzbpwM2UaYdUc1WKtGQu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUgtNWdBMmtpmEVdTgnDeb8EqhHc9zhyCgyWyoupPqVgs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Pm55U5NxqFaoMe3CSJHFkqYzRUkhyyQcL"], "tags": ["brokenscreen", "glitch", "bsotd037", "abstract", "glitchart", "abstractart", "brokenscreenoftheday", "bsotd", "photography", "rdklinc"], "extra": {}}
