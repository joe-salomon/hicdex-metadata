Inspired by the concept of wave-particle duality, which states that a quantum object can have two different characteristics at the same time, the series also can be seen as an aesthetic approach for analyzing the time-based mutual interactions between two seemingly separated perception forms. The visuals respectively sounds of this series are created with so called vector synthesis, which means that the visual representation one can see is the actual sound of a certain time frame and vice versa.\n\n2400 x 2400 Pixel, PNG", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifyzub6kzqaw4tebarxxxddjpwwhrnooqazm3twsagsunm4qr5ywi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibvxsnk62bpiwyyxaodfipwq4z4docknvthk5jdl3zkmrcozn4kpa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreifyzub6kzqaw4tebarxxxddjpwwhrnooqazm3twsagsunm4qr5ywi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Wjw8PF4FxnD6tpfN1W3s89GPp8yca2qw4"], "tags": ["generative", "dyad", "vector", "synthesis"], "extra": {}}
