Allah is the supreme director to the right path and belief. He does not compel people into religion, he has shown the right path through his messengers.\n\nAllah\u2019s name Ar-Rasheed is not directly used in the Quran. There are verses related to the attributes of this name.  \n\nThere shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. (Quran 2:256)\n\nSay, [O Muhammad], \u201cIt has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, \u2018Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur\u2019an. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone. And [it teaches] that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord (Quran 72:1-3)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV4pS5Bx9yS1sA9mWxWQpxuxw7UjP7psJLfi96f6FXU1G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXcgaWE1hrBEkLBV3PdoqixEGN5XtMT4H3tXctYKAhMzA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV4pS5Bx9yS1sA9mWxWQpxuxw7UjP7psJLfi96f6FXU1G", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["moslem", "religion", "colorful", "1of1", "asmaulhusna", "god", "asmaulhusnanft", "name", "allah", "islam"], "extra": {}}
