{"__version": 1, "token_id": 490343, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Vessels 165: CAP\u2019N", "description": "In the early days of the colony, survey expeditions of scientists and military personnel set out in all directions to chart humanity\u2019s strange and dangerous new home. On one such expedition Captain John Glass led his team into the hunting grounds of a vicious and unclassified native predator that remains undocumented today. The other seven members of  team were devoured by the beast, but Glass alone survived. Clawed across the face and torso and dying from his extensive wounds, he managed to crawl into a rocky fissure filled with a strange, glowing goo before he succumbed to his injuries. But death was not the end for the ill-fated captain. Crawling free of the fissure days later, he found himself mortally wounded and yet still alive thanks to some property of the alien glowing goo. And he has lived ever since, seemingly unable to die unless it be at the hands of the beast that killed him the first time.\n\nThe Cap\u2019n has long since forgotten his true name, but he survives as a legend, feared by allies and foes alike.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUSfsbees66r8maX7WDwX8XJBKDJSoQBk5Ma1RSKKssWu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmazK9D2ktDNxz9ZXd4Ws8LkVss5d14CtcrSEtUAWNyDBA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUSfsbees66r8maX7WDwX8XJBKDJSoQBk5Ma1RSKKssWu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["Vessels"], "extra": {}}
