He'd set up camp in an abandoned classroom not too far from the hall just in case these punks were smarter than average. He thought that might be the case; how these kids thought to communicate through the tattered magazines on the walls was beyond him. Not only that but there were probably thousands taped up throughout the campus. He'd never taken on a job like this before, but he needed that promotion. He didn't even know what threat the kids posed, but from what he'd decoded so far, he knew it was big. He didn't care, though. All he cared about was redemption.\n\nAll photography\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f was produced and edited by \ud83d\udd25Dennis Sarovski\ud83d\udd25, Poem is by my Wife :) \nCheck me out on: https://www.instagram.com/dennis_sarovski/\nCheck her out on: https://www.instagram.com/thewrittennomad/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbRQnYyq5juaTXz5YEWo4fFuHiHvbz9oPUA1B7uKQN88y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeddKCiQiq2JnYPEpd3a9ES3Z1ddjmmMbHKVvMePDGoJx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbRQnYyq5juaTXz5YEWo4fFuHiHvbz9oPUA1B7uKQN88y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SFQD7VLwDVkiWBmyeR8PoyFaifRtaeKTa"], "tags": ["nft", "cyberpunk", "cyber", "hall", "animated", "neon", "cool", "digitalart", "digital", "art", "photo", "photograph", "aftereffects", "irl", "urban", "architectural", "hicetnunc", "abstract", "creative", "hen", "nftart", "loop", "mp4", "pic", "techno", "duochrome", "pink", "green", "tezos", "blockchain", "crypto", "popular", "artwork", "effect", "rare", "trending"], "extra": {}}
