The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the\u00a0disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics lacking in classical mechanics", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRBrVZ9rsqXRUjP9j6ktENKAQyDKdvABWoWeE87mojN1D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUBREsVmhBdsiVakTSZ2iNwm56AG8CDeyCHtEpeyGM4py", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRBrVZ9rsqXRUjP9j6ktENKAQyDKdvABWoWeE87mojN1D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UEqCxFos8ViCLUTre9brJSZS7XYbtX9GT"], "tags": ["Link", "Entaglement", "particles", "love", "gold"], "extra": {}}
