I took this photo just before the top of Wo\u0142owiec. The sun appeared somewhere above the High Tatras chain and it was there, where I saw it for the first time. A moment before sunrise, mists and clouds warmed by first rays of the sun suddenly moved and started to move. It was on them that the first rays of the sun became delicate, yet incredibly saturated with colour and brightness.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXPjXULh2eZywPL4ncnUjuozLFLXjCRNxGGZtJLTgpJXH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPnj1RZSTZ9iVTUBWzi1z5Bk7wc85wy1eJmdbvKai9j4f", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXPjXULh2eZywPL4ncnUjuozLFLXjCRNxGGZtJLTgpJXH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QGnFHUB1NX7mBvBDg85CMUrpXPWKLg4aW"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "colors", "saturation", "light", "beauty", "camera", "grass", "sun", "mountains", "tatras", "sky", "sunrise", "fogs"], "extra": {}}
