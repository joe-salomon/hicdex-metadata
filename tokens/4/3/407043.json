After we stuff the boat with more baggage it gradually begins to sink under the immense weight of the unnecessary things we put into the boat as we can't possibly imagine\"life\" without those things, which might not really be the basic necessities that we need while undertaking a journey. Even our \"Life\" can holden our burdens (things which we fancy possessing,etc.)upto a certain limit. The men are in a dilemma as they possess too much of \"baggage\" to take with them during their trip....These unnecessary stuff which contains their so-called lives makes the boat look as if it is \"filled with life\". Hence life is compared to a boat and like a boat, life is overburdened with our increasing demands and desires.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdpLvx5FHLPgEq5oecN6S41sbhTgTacp5apLUosSpg4sS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ8jV9U1gV9J2saRJuVG6C2Cwsaf2C8o2dxba8kUCHMA6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdpLvx5FHLPgEq5oecN6S41sbhTgTacp5apLUosSpg4sS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aJjm1fYCJfcjpaX5f5fZ6FL1DVqHVtzAs"], "tags": ["#art#nft#hen#boat#objkts"], "extra": {}}
