{"__version": 1, "token_id": 339543, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CONSUME FROM WOMB TO TOMB", "description": "Growing up in suburbia New Jersey one and half stone's throw away from NYC, I had probably the best childhood a human could possibly have. (Thank you mom and dad.) In the world that I came from, money was plenty and used somewhat garishly. The American Dream loosely tells us that anyone can come to America and work hard and live a better life and thus passing that onto the next generation. That's what we're taught from an early age onward. For the most part on paper, that sounds amazing. Who wouldn't come to America for that? It's baked into our society and it's difficult to see it any other way, but when you do see The American Dream for what it is, you kind of see it like a DeBeers ad for diamonds. Why diamonds Andrew? Great question audience. Everyone on the planet has been duped by the relentless DeBeers and frankly other companies in that industry to have you believe that diamonds should be the most valuable of precious stones. Ahhhhh...but the reality is that diamonds are incredibly plentiful and yet valued way higher than they should be. Why is that? There is a collective belief between people that those should be worth more. But why? It's been baked into our societies, just like American Capitalism...from the womb to the tomb...all we do is consume, not realizing that there are better and less self-centered ways of being. But wait...doesn't that make you a Socialist or...GASP...a Communist? No. Not even close. People make it out as if there are only a few different ways of making markets. There are sustainable ways of living, working, learning, and growing other than the status quo. First Nation economies from before \"Contact\" were thriving and living within the natural world. There is a way to have both and I believe the future is just that a hybrid of both worlds.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdgjR7ea29TQyGwJFzQRzGpkScu681i5zmRij47roiyUf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSNzqbdDXA17jFmsNJNXvxZeCxqd8Ws72E6mh7wG3rpZZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdgjR7ea29TQyGwJFzQRzGpkScu681i5zmRij47roiyUf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
