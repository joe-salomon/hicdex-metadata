It is listed as endangered by the IUCN as of 2018.\n\nThere are two populations: One is found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa, within three National Parks: Mgahinga, in southwest Uganda; Volcanoes, in northwest Rwanda; and Virunga, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The other population is found in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Some primatologists speculate the Bwindi population is a separate subspecies, though no description has been finalized. As of June 2018, there were more than 1,000 individuals.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUAoeSDi1N18S8hPj3CohwjKB4WGY1yxW7FyDsLKXyjip", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYC6pLyx5aBYKADJwJDzr6hi4eGCjQyM18McH6EDtPVw8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUAoeSDi1N18S8hPj3CohwjKB4WGY1yxW7FyDsLKXyjip", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XXkNzVWugHLK4G3B9E8E59xrnHYey85v7"], "tags": ["save", "animals", "animais", "planet", "nature", "natureza", "rare", "raro", "salve", "arte", "colecionavel", ""], "extra": {}}
