Years ago I had this crazy vision for a temporary or possibly a permanent installation in a big old warehouse. The loose idea would be to create gigantic walls that would make 4 separate rooms. 2 enormous doors, counter cornered from the inner part of the rooms' center would open and close in a clockwise order. There would be hallways that you would be able to walk through or the viewer could go into these rooms. The viewer could leave whatever they wanted in the room; flowers, cards, notes, trash, or whatever they wanted as a way to fill the space. The entire warehouse is a representation of the size of my loving heart for art and the art community. The rooms represent the 4 chambers of the human heart. The trash represents what people actually feel about the work and/or me as a person. Every evening the trash and all items would be removed from all the rooms. I would keep one item from each day as a momento; something to connect me to the viewers.
