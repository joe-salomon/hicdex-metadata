The cells are arranged in a bidimensional grid and initially they are in a random state. At each generation a cell in state i evolves to state i+1 mod N if at least one of its neighbors is in state i+1.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNM8jD116MUjXNqcwWJKTkfGnPL6QZ4SYm3W9UzDLfK2T", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbwdL4bbb4r6AQuiPG2FphreXTxXPz3n4DP88yfBxA9hY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNM8jD116MUjXNqcwWJKTkfGnPL6QZ4SYm3W9UzDLfK2T", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ft8ZPvFdcsMa2LyyA4h53Mm61bRHXBMfc"], "tags": ["cca"], "extra": {}}
