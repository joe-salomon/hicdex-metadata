I was in the middle of nowhere, and this buffalo where rooming around this old construction.  Usually, I would have walked close to the animals, but this was an open road, and the herd was far away behind a small creek and a wired fence chilling, eating, and playing.  All I could do was use my long lens and my windows as a tripod to take as many photos as possible.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPGx1gacutmqgRTzkpThtXMFB5nGi2fwcRDpWY474Ewd8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY8o1LRCBmLr9w3mTuXmhWfWWMUS2RZbeL6HpcebEVvvf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPGx1gacutmqgRTzkpThtXMFB5nGi2fwcRDpWY474Ewd8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2W1qWJzRxckpSFprsQyhEFHiCWL7hPtoAC"], "tags": ["photography", "buffalos", "sheNFT", "travelphotography", ""], "extra": {}}
