I took this photograph on a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago in 2015. Back in my studio, I started to explore how I could balance the massive weight of an islands edge on the left using differing shapes and lines to the right. In the process, I realized there could be many successful outcomes. And that there was no SINGLE image that best expressed a solution.\n\nWhile the base image is the same, each solution is a unique piece. \nPhysically printed, allowing studio dust and fingerprints to accumulate, adding a sense of place and history in the physical world. Then manipulated and scanned.\n\nThis is COLOR solution 5, for those that collected 3 or more B/W solutions.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZDrGce8UkwpurZDFqmqPJox72S37wPEUD7gRXacy7jr9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc5b5QPmC3muCTs7nghd3SvMKRsqHv8WVwrw5o7JVdHR5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZDrGce8UkwpurZDFqmqPJox72S37wPEUD7gRXacy7jr9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PsY6huVzWihab1EX1Axrtk72ip9qQHBCs"], "tags": ["galapagos", "color", "garyedwardblum"], "extra": {}}
