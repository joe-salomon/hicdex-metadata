I rode a bike When I couldn't dodge a barbed wire. The worst thing was that the owner of the lot didn't want to help me, I laughed a lot after agonizing for 2 hours curled up on the wire I died, through this message I ask you to make it so I can rest in peace. Send this to 20 communities and my soul will be saved by you and the other 20 you will receive. If you don't pass this message on, I'll visit you tonight so you can get to know this wire up close. On the 15th of July Mariana decided to laugh at this message, one night later she disappeared without a trace. The same happened with Kare on October 18th. No break that chain please unless you want to feel my presence", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTjADn51x8eUpqxkNSPDbt3xrq6UmFQBktuzAPqhPR2t3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTjADn51x8eUpqxkNSPDbt3xrq6UmFQBktuzAPqhPR2t3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTjADn51x8eUpqxkNSPDbt3xrq6UmFQBktuzAPqhPR2t3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gUuaHkwv4woiJxT8xznB3oWE3k31CMnAV"], "tags": ["samara", "leschvth"], "extra": {}}
