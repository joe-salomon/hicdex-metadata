{"__version": 1, "token_id": 484648, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "#11 Khat", "description": "Khat (also known as qat or chat) comprises the leaves and fresh shoots of Catha edulis Forsk, a flowering evergreen shrub cultivated in East Africa and the South-West Arabian Peninsula. Khat leaves are typically wrapped as a bundle in banana leaves. The principal active components in khat are cathinone and cathine. Chewing khat releases these substances into the saliva; they are rapidly absorbed and eliminated. Both cathinone and cathine are closely related to amphetamine, and the pharmacological effects of cathinone are qualitatively similar to those of amphetamine, although it is less potent. Only fresh leaves are chewed because cathinone soon degrades into old or dry plant material. The analysis relies on the characteristic appearance of khat and the presence of cathinone and/or cathine. Khat is not under International control.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmch9w6RoeapuZr5uMFq9L5BedYgSuTW2FDsVrbUxwMyyn", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmch9w6RoeapuZr5uMFq9L5BedYgSuTW2FDsVrbUxwMyyn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmch9w6RoeapuZr5uMFq9L5BedYgSuTW2FDsVrbUxwMyyn", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "collectible", "nft", "art"], "extra": {}}
