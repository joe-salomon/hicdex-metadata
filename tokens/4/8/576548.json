{"__version": 1, "token_id": 576548, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sombras - Addendum #001", "description": "\nN\u00e9on puppet mum. \n\nMost puppets leave their mum to become Sombras. Don't get me wrong, they love her, but the desire to fuck around is hard to resist. Once a puppet leaves their mum and cuts ties there is no coming back. But even when they both will no longer be one, their special link will never be lost.\n\nPlease, take care of this mum like any good Sombra would do. By doing so and having \"N\u00e9on puppet mum\" in your wallet, you will have the chance to buy a 1/1 Sombra when they are released.\n\n\n\n\nThese addendums will develop \"Sombras\" history and help spread its world without 1/1 limitations. Owners of this artwork will have one spot on the upcoming presale of \"Sombras\" collectible series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJcamikaze (2021)\n\"Sombras - Addendum #001 - N\u00e9on puppet mum.\"\n\n-----\n\n.PNG, 30,3Mb", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUEmooXJumJvygXgfK6545MMD5xh8PJQRgy8RKYgQbQ9u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYpcL2xjbuNu12ufK7TqAgD7Rtn7Vf4R1YdrE731uEZVq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUEmooXJumJvygXgfK6545MMD5xh8PJQRgy8RKYgQbQ9u", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Nf9cbEEwpSYdr8xeNRgwPCqHzmkUiaGo7"], "tags": ["Sombras", "jcamikaze", "neonpupetmum", "curatedbysutan"], "extra": {}}
