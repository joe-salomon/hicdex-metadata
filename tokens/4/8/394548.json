Where did he belong?\n\nIn Islam, in the afterlife, everyone will be revived and crossing a bridge. I don't know if I remember it correctly or not, but someone said how someone crosses the bridge depends on how he lives his life.\n\nAbu Nuwas is publicly known as a wise, humorous person and someone who held his religion closely, but still, he has a lifestyle that looks like a person who does not know God. In his youth, he was known as someone who always enjoyed drinking alcohol until he was drunk and loved to flirt with women and men. Even though he always did repentance every night.\n\nBut is it we have a capacity to judge someone by only their reflected attitude? Because we didn't know what was happening in their heart.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZYeUbE341ghvt4C5hhEAS54xySrWurKeEemRbpvrXZac", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTwYAPZAZ7fjeABDa27rw4CnEf9yLypPXGZjCfwVyrigm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZYeUbE341ghvt4C5hhEAS54xySrWurKeEemRbpvrXZac", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hzAsBJzifph6288TAmwSZsW94pgK8fWAz"], "tags": ["Drawing", "Illustration", "PNG", "Watercolor", "Spiritual"], "extra": {}}
