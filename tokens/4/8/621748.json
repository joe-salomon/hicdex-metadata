These 3 words are forever linked to each other, whether I make this artwork or not. This is the kind of weird quantum foam I keep referring to every now and then. As Einstein famously referred to the concept of quantum entanglement, \"spooky action from a distance\". In many abstract ways, English is similar, but obviously way different. No matter what happened in the past, or what is happening now, and/or way in the distant future...these three words will forever hold a bond. I eagerly look for words like this. You don't come across them quite often, but when you do you know you have something quite special. To find a triumvirate like this we need to think about words that can be used as a prefix and/or a suffix of a word; not an easy task. Hopefully, I'll be able to triangulate (see what I did there?) some more and and showcase them.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPmehtd3g7ydtho2AU8JmDepi64gyh9CpG6pmqRzyvKE5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTsU3Pn4MNFbiKf1bct8hV2PR8R4xaM8UKsijHWqLJq17", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPmehtd3g7ydtho2AU8JmDepi64gyh9CpG6pmqRzyvKE5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
