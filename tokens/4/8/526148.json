Ground Rules Made and abided.\n\nPerspective #2\nWho is this guy who\u2019s come into my life with this openness to pour his heart out to be who I barely know. Why are our conversations getting so deep and personal, feeling connected?\nI\u2019m at a bar with my bestie, and hey, let\u2019s invite this new friend I\u2019ve made who I\u2019ve known for a while but never really knew per se.\nOMG, it\u2019s been so long, you look so different and happy. Let\u2019s go outside by the firepit.\nMolly? Hesitantly, Yes please.\nI know just where to go.\nBody Massage feels great, but you know this can\u2019t go anywhere further. (Ground Rules)\n\nPerspective #3\n\nAre we sure this guy is cool, do you think he\u2019ll actually come out here? What\u2019s his game plan with you, do you think?\nOh hey, Rob, nice to meet you, want to get a drink?\nLet\u2019s go somewhere a little less loud, outside by the fire.\nMolly, are you sure, is this for real Happening Now?? Let\u2019s go, now!\nAfter perspective #2\u2019s ground rules were also abided.\nPerspective #3 may have not been totally content, and felt adventurous of his own.\nDoes he try to explore with Perspective #1 who didn\u2019t set any ground rule, maybe\nBut it all came out innocently and respectfully, More of an exploration of feeling someone out when you don't really know them.\n\nNothing, bad, regretful, or anything negative came about that night, for perspective #1, I can vouch for it personally. Just a beautiful night of meeting possibly long term friends that you feel you can already trust.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXrsnZ12J4FUDEAYGzpRWWYozcYRzNawyA25yinpMg9dy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXr9MBp23yJ36vQfqptbmMzW1QtRjsyui74VRe7mvYf6h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXrsnZ12J4FUDEAYGzpRWWYozcYRzNawyA25yinpMg9dy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LiKcgzMA8E75vHtrr3wLk5Sx7r3GyMDNe"], "tags": ["spokenword", "freeright", "topic", "based", "poetry"], "extra": {}}
