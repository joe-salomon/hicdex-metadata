It was in my shoe box that was sitting under a pile of books. I remembered that day clearly. It was our one month anniversary. You hugged and kissed me and said, \"I know, I know...we have email and texts message, but I want to, well I thought, anyway, don't read it now, do it when you get home\". You were a bit embarrassed, I thought it was sweet. I could hardly sleep that night, I was so happy to have found you.\n\nYes, I can still feel every word and I cherish every single one of them. Rest easy, my love.\n\nWith this image I wanted to capture the feeling of missing someone so much, that it hurts.\n\nThis piece (as static) also received a merit award in 2019 3x3 publication.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdwzwfCVEnaBL1XJzCqXxCU5wnTnFwPsBFwH52Ds5rZbw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU3S5xiTC14BNepuFSt9RVC2uwKT6dPpLBDC2ms2nCwHK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdwzwfCVEnaBL1XJzCqXxCU5wnTnFwPsBFwH52Ds5rZbw", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hkE6Jf2pzu9Kmdbgew7fKi1EqvuR1hAVw"], "tags": ["Dynamic", "rare", "digital", "digitalart", "video", "female", "fantasy", "color", "2D", "collectibles", "beauty", "letters", "water", "tears"], "extra": {}}
