{"__version": 1, "token_id": 478848, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "nipple ringer", "description": "There are an almost infinite number of ways to wrap an earring around a set of aggressively chaffed, visibly sad, vaguely human nipples. On the surface it may seem like a simple concept but prepare to be sickened and spiritually ruined by the variety of combinations the depraved human mind can produce. Each output from 'Nipple Ringers' is derived from a unique piercing that took place at an abandoned Claire\u2019s in Northeastern Indiana, just outside of Gary. Feature variations include nipple count, amount of wrinkles, animal or human, brass or tungsten, and a few colorful flourishes for additional suffering.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfXLdVoixzv5dGhGFbGDHy7edvmjAMgccj96N8MdVZPY3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmaz6AJpyYkRJuXGqdcUEQ7AaaGAnYDd4bdYXx9HucEaAV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfXLdVoixzv5dGhGFbGDHy7edvmjAMgccj96N8MdVZPY3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LoS9bZpbEHRztqXTfbCvqXCKPAdGYLEUq"], "tags": ["diewiththemostlikes"], "extra": {}}
