Hazzard used fasting as a treatment for a variety of ailments, creating her own sanitarium where she swindled her clients out of a lot of money. Under her care, 15 people died. She was convicted of manslaughter for one of those deaths, but received a full pardon from the Governor of the state of Washington. \n\nHazzard would continue to sell her fasting treatment throughout the rest of her life. She even moved to New Zealand for a fresh start and a fresh group of victims. In 1920, it was revealed that she did not attend medical school so she was fined and she went back to the States. She opened another sanitarium, under the name of \u201chealth school\u201d due to her lack of credentials, which mysteriously burned down. \n\nEventually, Hazzard would become a victim of her own treatments in 1938. She died of starvation while attempting her own fasting cure.
