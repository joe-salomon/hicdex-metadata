A \u201cCagaita\u201d, a tree of Brazilian Cerrado that bursts into white flowers during the dry season for a couple of weeks, lends its unique beauty to a performance that respectfully contours its shape.\n.\nCapturing life\u2019s impermanency and its pulsating energy are at the core of the project Impermanent Sculptures. It relates to something prior to life itself, rather an impulse, a primordial force, one that penetrates and emanates from everything, living and seemingly non-living beings. It illustrates an invisible force that will endure even after we return to dust, like the sterile soil of the Moon.\n.\nThis 4K animated GIF depicts the result which is conceived from real action with fireworks, a performance that shifts between spontaneity and control. Post-edit is limited to blending photos together, but never creating digital artifacts that were not originally photographed.\n.\nTo paint with light in a three-dimensional space is to bring one\u2019s thoughts from the unconscious to the conscious.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQEmrH7wcTTfDR72iWDgfDKPbkmT5quSjuNWwiKBwFyM5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQEmrH7wcTTfDR72iWDgfDKPbkmT5quSjuNWwiKBwFyM5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQEmrH7wcTTfDR72iWDgfDKPbkmT5quSjuNWwiKBwFyM5", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Uki7n3eDNwTKeNXBhUMEZesDQksKNnEa3"], "tags": ["esculturasimpermanentes", "impermanentsculptures", "lightpainting", "cerrado", "longexposure", "sparkles", "brasilia", "cagaita"], "extra": {}}
