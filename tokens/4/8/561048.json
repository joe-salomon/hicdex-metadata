I listened to Overgound Railroad: The Green Book. My wife took a photo of my angel on my dashboard, and she drew a doorway while we hung out with my sister and my Dad. \n\n\n\nWe started our NFT journey on OpenSea. We had our first sales and we found a community making beautiful digital art  on Tezos. We found collectors who loved my wife\u2019s paintings remixed and re-interpreted, my stories to images in Gan art. We added hand drawings and layers. The community has a story weaved into the fabric of what we are creating everyday. \n\n\n\nIf all of our  methods come together on this canvas, today, I am less interested in my story, and more of what the viewers see. How our blueprints and roadmaps help others on their own journey into the metaverse, through their own past and future. This mashup evolves my/our artful techniques of creating mixed media visuals with hand drawing and vintage text and imagery. The full sized original is on Open Sea.  6 pieces are scattered on Tezos. \n\n\n\nHere are the images and text in my search, all inspiration to create The Dreamer Handbook.\n\n\n\nGreen Book\n\nBaltimore redlining maps\n\nVintage cadillac\n\nBlack Nativity\n\nMt. Sinai\n\nPlantation\n\nRearview mirror\n\nWinding roads\n\nCar radio dashboard\n\nBlack hands\n\nSteering wheel\n\nUnderground railroad\n\nMason Dixon\n\nSegregation signs\n\nUniverse\n\nIntegration signs\n\nApartheid signs\n\nNazi Germany signs\n\nMoon\n\nNo Vacancy signs\n\nMetaverse hotel\n\n\n900x414 300 DPI\n\n\nNFT owner has the right to resell the NFT and to publicly display the art.
