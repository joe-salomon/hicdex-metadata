The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: Somewhere, somehow, an American flag is waved. A monkey or ape with a human-like head and body has grabbed it, and is attempting to hold it with it\u2019s mighty hand. As this happens, the \nflag is let go, and the scene changes. In a large empty room, on a large bed, I see a short blonde woman kneeling on all fours; her bottom is about to touch the bed. I roll over, and tell her, \u201cOh my god.\u201d There is a problem with the electricity: The lights will go out, and the bathroom will be unusable. I walk to the kitchen, where a mother and daughter are at work. The mother is frustrated by a light problem. When she returns, I see that the daughter is trying to burn off the mother\u2019s hair from her face. In a panic, I run from the room. While someone else discusses getting the mother a restraining order, I tell them to contact the attorney for the family business.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 66 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZiqnJAzb8KGadQCeuZDNnVxYpJEFMRcwJoiVXToHo8nV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdbvWrr32U1ZNkEw7g9V4pGE6JzaDoDEycfTwtzHyWkSq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZiqnJAzb8KGadQCeuZDNnVxYpJEFMRcwJoiVXToHo8nV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
