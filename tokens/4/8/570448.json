When our lives change we are almost never ready for those changes regardless of what they are. If you wait for when you feel ready you'll be waiting forever and then it will be too late. My wife and I planned to have a child and yet I still wasn't ready to be a father until I was, and had to learn and grow right along with her. I wasn't ready to enter the crypto space, but at the beginning of this project I put a bunch of stuff I was planning aside and just made and minted my first piece. Anyone and everyone can transform what they know about themselves into whatever they wish, they just have to make the decision to do it. Don't wait, do it now.
