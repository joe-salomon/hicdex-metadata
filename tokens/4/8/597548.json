As a photographer my biggest responsibility was to make these sufferings more visible. All of the photos you will see in this series are archive photos taken by me in the last 10 years, covering various moments of struggle.\n\nThe photographs of these sufferings serve as a roadmap for the next generation. This series will always be limited edition. All of them were shot under very difficult conditions and are archival. that's why the prices are higher. They will be much more valuable for collectors in the future. Some of the photographs in this series have been and will continue to be published in major exhibitions around the world and in various magazines.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma3VAazAdiGUpEQ7Ex6xJb91DWpWjNtNX9ecmAxgswk74", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYZiweWCjMfsJPsk7sv5J7BN5irXYiiRZ2MnfWP39b5GJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma3VAazAdiGUpEQ7Ex6xJb91DWpWjNtNX9ecmAxgswk74", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1P5BmwDjpPgmwbwwQFnHMgmWvMq4pJaAYE"], "tags": ["photography", "street", "photojournalism", "istanbul", "turkey", "nftphotography", "anarchy", "chaos", "vforvendetta", "vendetta", "red"], "extra": {}}
