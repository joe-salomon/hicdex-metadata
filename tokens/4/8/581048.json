{"__version": 1, "token_id": 581048, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ALIEN / ELIAN", "description": "If you're over the age of 30 you may remember the name Elian Gonzalez? If you don't you can search the internet as the entire story would be too long to fit onto this page along with the commentary. I always found it truly ironic that when you anagram the name ELIAN, it spells ALIEN. Even though in today's society we really try not to use such microaggressions like the term \"ALIEN\" as in \"illegal alien\" when talking about someone coming into the country through the borders illegally in acts of desperation. That term has been replaced with \"Undocumented Immigrant\", which a step in the right direction in terms of using non-pejoratives. So many of these people are just trying to live a better life for themselves and their families. Remember from previous pages, we don't build walls, we build a bigger table. Immigration is a very complicated and seemingly never ending issue. The illegal immigration is just the end result of what is happening in their home countries. Maybe if we address and helped these nations with the resources we have to assist them to have a more robust economy, maybe this could change the paradigm. That's awfully na\u00efve of me to think that, but it it couldn't hurt. All that from an anagram of ALIEN.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmddMaTXP9dQqCZfprcVoYzdW4TywS8uNu83q8vszDpByk", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc4oE8M86CypQ83138qGc35HWPMDM9JSyN2AJbiewJZsU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmddMaTXP9dQqCZfprcVoYzdW4TywS8uNu83q8vszDpByk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
