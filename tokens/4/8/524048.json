{"__version": 1, "token_id": 524048, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Miles Davis", "description": "Miles, this abstract jazz piece is a combination of glitch and audio manipulation. The audio is made up of only one note of Miles trumpet. This note has been time stretched and manipulated with fX to produce the different sounds and textures. This is an open edition to commemorate the minting of this new type of abstract jazz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 \u2013 September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.\n\n\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVztRma7QvbLprGfQTSJUTgXsud3paCXW6mGNU3bThWN5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbTQE2qPvN5QfeEpxmZ5AwxQNWC11xeehXXG3N7CJGJmY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVztRma7QvbLprGfQTSJUTgXsud3paCXW6mGNU3bThWN5", "mimeType": "audio/x-wav"}], "creators": ["tz1QbNsyBSznN3T4eQsHtFjhNbjwsu3iEZ5G"], "tags": ["Abstractjazz", "audio", "abstract", "glitch", "loop", "gif", ""], "extra": {}}
