Now I\u2019m a photographer. Through photography I want to convey my thoughts, inner world and manifesto. I like to show the beauty of women. I like to transmit through the photograph of great directors and artists. I love the visual component of photography. I like that the photo often does not make sense, but is simply a beautiful picture. Beauty in everything and I want you to see it with me!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd92fpuRuhN9iKEdeJhi3zfgJRE8brm5LS49zNAt66KEX", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd92fpuRuhN9iKEdeJhi3zfgJRE8brm5LS49zNAt66KEX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd92fpuRuhN9iKEdeJhi3zfgJRE8brm5LS49zNAt66KEX", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["Me", "myself", "photographer"], "extra": {}}
