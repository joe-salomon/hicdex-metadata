SPECIAL EDITION.", "description": "SPECIAL BONUS HOLOGRAM EDITION from the \u201cRenaissance\u201d genesis collection.\nIt\u2019s a collection that emerges from past eras to reconnect us with our nature as human beings and remind us four of the stages of our development.\n\nDescription of the piece:\nThis is the fourth and last stage of human development. The individual is at the highest point of his existence. Having already tamed her fears and longings. Having already overcome life. Here, near his last breath, is when he is ready to share his legacy. The author symbolizes this stage with Saint George giving the final thrust to a dragon with his spear. The dragon represents life, fears and goals achieved. The knight is beyond human life, dominating the earthly drives and surrendered to a higher spiritual world.\n\nMP4 - 1080\u200a\u00d71560px\n\nFull story here: nft.matiasmarano.com/renaissance", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma75HpQ3SZHPfzVyQSeLGge5gVUCtv5gR2rtVJfZCSDBm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaGE2M6QYxtrrpfnXVJQp25ccs1NmzudArUFSQU3WSJc3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma75HpQ3SZHPfzVyQSeLGge5gVUCtv5gR2rtVJfZCSDBm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2NzvDGTtWUd195Yi5YewHXSY6mEwbmWjF4"], "tags": ["illustration", "renaissance", "2d", "contemporaryart", "fineart", "digitalillustration", "painting", "saintgeorge", "stgeorge", "nfts", "collection", "paint", "dragon", "knight", "skull", "battle", "fight", "death", "spear", "horse", "nft", "hologram", "bonus", "special"], "extra": {}}
