Over 30k inserts were ordered with the tempting, but vague, hint that they would include a new utility.\n\nCollectors were encouraged to combine their new black and white Marlenes with existing color-focused Inserts.  By burning older Inserts along with the new Marlenes 18 different color hues were created, each resulting in a new painting of a new Marlene.  Collectors were assembling their very own \"palettes\" from which they would paint.  \n\nThis thr33smas version is a new painting of those original mints.\n\nThe 12 Days of thr33smas is a chase 3v3nt.  Collect all 12, #3MAS1 through #3MAS12, in the announced timeframe to receive #3MAS13 via airdrop.\n\nThis card is an INSERT. It has all established Standard Insert Utility and may compound additional Utilities over time. It is the very first thr33smas Insert and a Holiday Insert. ***** digital capture of original painting, gouache on vintage baseball card, 2021. ************ NFT image is for personal use, no commercial rights are granted.
