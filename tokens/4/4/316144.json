This was so important among the Western aristocracy that the rulers and the rich deliberately (after taking a finger to the throat) returned all the food eaten to empty the stomach and eat again!\nIn contrast, the poor had slender physiques that were considered to be due to lack of financial resources and proper food, but obesity was a beauty for women among the Qajar people. As we can see from the photographs from that period, the number of obese women was much higher than fat men.\n\nDuring the Qajar period, Iranians considered female beauty as the criterion for obesity instead of face, and fat women were always more popular in the court of Qajar kings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP9mkrkPEycHidQhicZ3tvXjfAK2bApMRTNFy9xvm8Gke", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPx9QES8tqoAaGYMYH7NtdcYQoBda2Knr2NDBLj8aJtSv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP9mkrkPEycHidQhicZ3tvXjfAK2bApMRTNFy9xvm8Gke", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1byfv1EckZBdrd9Z3CVp6nY8W7WRYWf6qn"], "tags": ["generative", "geometricart", "geomatic", "generativedesign", "hen200k", "psychedelicart", "minimal", "opticalart", "coding", "newmediaart", "trippy", "object4objekt", "artxcode", "mathart", "geometry", "processing", "proceduralart", "creativecodeart", "abstract", "persian", "pixelart", "creativecoding", "psychedelic", "genartclub", "iran", "rare", "touchdesigner", "pattern", "feminist", "sexy", "machinelearning", "computerart", "photomontage", "pixels", "qajar", "girl", "procedural", "photography", "photo", "artandtechnology", "noise", "glsl", ""], "extra": {}}
