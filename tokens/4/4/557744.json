So much burns up in the descent to Bhu-loka leaving behind only this avatar with its hobbled mind. An anxiety that fears the future, a depression that mourns the past; they confine me to the here and now. I used to call that 'presence' but it's really more of a prison. It's a sacred duty to turn the wheel of life, to end to all things and usher new beginnings hundreds of times over. Remaining in the present feels leaving a job unfinished. Like dragging out a story and never coming to a conclusion. Who would be satisfied with that?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQN81EdL63xKqDAdM2iYChoF5Gy3D5cQR5aV4HRRf2Foh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSF7C2Z36gFXkNvRoCjbq4UGGkv8MK1W8SC6ZLULTyHn1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQN81EdL63xKqDAdM2iYChoF5Gy3D5cQR5aV4HRRf2Foh", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1atgnprZ8P9QYPu2TZxE9GRRvdWDNYEByM"], "tags": ["illustration", "digital", "digitalart", "mythology", "flashfiction"], "extra": {}}
