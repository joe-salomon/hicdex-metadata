{"__version": 1, "token_id": 564244, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Metamorphosis", "description": "Based on true story, 'Metamorphosis' presents a metaphorical audio visual journey about presence of time and hope from perspective of a 23 years young man living with walking aids.  Growing up with walking aids/AFO possesses both positive and negative emotions such as disappointment, pity, confidence and comfort and desire to break the boundaries. It's just a matter of time.\n--\nBGM attribution: Kevin MacLeod - Wisdom In The Sun (Public Domain/No Copyright)\n--\nCC:\nI was a little caterpillar. Shy and weak, not confident and struggling.\nA phase has passed and as time goes by I started to believe. Small steps that I made with my walking aids left some memories. I gained the courage to face the world. I started to accept that rocks that I saw were not as big as I had thought. A decade has passed. I am a cocoon now. Stronger than before, collecting faith and hope but still isolated by barriers. Soon or later, time will not come as barrier but as a gift. I believe God will fulfill my wildest dream\u2014to walk normally and to run. It might be the time that I fly like a butterfly.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX4YvSqHnwHXimJfoNtX4JcGA1idNrm4s3nAwsPPT74Bq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPETmrrryVQDeBdaUpkmTvnCH1kg8C8G1CyBMRJAP22Aj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmPjpd7sbWvaGAQqBmVxb8P44fvBnskbddiybLG4zxBFoi", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX4YvSqHnwHXimJfoNtX4JcGA1idNrm4s3nAwsPPT74Bq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VnQyokHQf8UT7JAtUSNt5jpVmgStgyoEW"], "tags": ["digital", "NFTArt", "NFTPrizedMoments", "AMJ02", "illustration", "poetry", "art", "disability", "inclusive", "tezos", "green", "pink", "ferdinanfiv", "time", "life", "metamorphosis", "butterfly", "universe", "spinabifida"], "extra": {}}
