My body was found 3 months after the tragedy by the police, without wearing a single cloth, my body was stiff and rotting, the strangulation marks still linger on my neck to this day, and forever. Don't be afraid of me, I didn't come to scare you, I'm here to help women who are going through the same thing as me. I don't know how long this will continue, I hope this tragedy doesn't happen again to other women\n\nNona Nancy, Indonesia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSq9mBkRhyoMe6nMkAGs5Kg5HpAkeZ9NTMxjaMycRzeKe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQpv4aFK2ux1cjUphCahcHMFPq6gtipSNk2xmtk9WMa2J", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSq9mBkRhyoMe6nMkAGs5Kg5HpAkeZ9NTMxjaMycRzeKe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fLvSUtnMQ1EvDW9tjebUCurC43MQfCwAJ"], "tags": ["photography", "nude", "naked", "nonanancy", "shadow", "women", ""], "extra": {}}
