Then you can click on any of the digital keys to play a sound-bite from the movie. There is also a backing music track that you can play too. And I also digitally painted the image of Craig and Smokey. \nThe UI/UX was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And I spent several hours collecting sound-bites and turning them into audio samples that I then assigned to keys on my MIDI keyboard. The backing music track is also original.\n\nIf the keys aren't working, try refreshing the page.\nHave fun and enjoy!\nwww.theguidingrock.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZidKjBdkoj4UgXsmjbB8HbGmcCQsFbPb8L1xCsUPAzx5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS3giRNisFdJnRyKbArGsr9Qty4s3Xd7HxFNgSL1eSAfZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZidKjBdkoj4UgXsmjbB8HbGmcCQsFbPb8L1xCsUPAzx5", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hnmpvKPDDnXfh9tkE2ouWG2rP3uaUVjC4"], "tags": ["html", "interactive", "web", "css", "javascript", "Friday", "movie", "fridaymovie", "sound-bites", "audio", "music", "keyboard", "digital", "cool", "awesome", "guidingrock", "icecube", "christucker", "sound", "soundbite"], "extra": {}}
