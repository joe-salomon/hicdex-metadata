If the helpless confusion is the darkness Hope is a light in the dark At the same time, the moonlight was unpredictable. One day the moonlight was bright. The next day, it gradually darkened and faded away. The next day it came back to shine again.\n\nThe moon may be high up in the sky and no matter how high we climb, we cannot reach Hope is the same. Some may travel, but many cannot be reached.\n\nBut even hope is unpredictable. But if you have a picture of the moon in your mind Even if you can't get it You will always have a clear goal.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTqbzswaM9saiKVfEGFWGFCBR79VDWfBs21ng9WLjStGV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ9x3tnYNhEEqShkKvm8JZk5RG2PCMNh8bAfhPdtvwbsQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTqbzswaM9saiKVfEGFWGFCBR79VDWfBs21ng9WLjStGV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L4D1pNmrUeyWCPGX8QGcWh4q6az3r62bi"], "tags": ["illustration", "feeling", "b/w", "b/wofgirls", "drawing"], "extra": {}}
