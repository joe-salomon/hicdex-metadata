Mushroom.", "description": "Once on Earth, my disembodied being, which is commonly referred to here as the soul, began to seek shelter. The planet was living its turbulent life and I really wanted to become a part of it as soon as possible. But it wasn't easy.\n\nAfter long wanderings, I was able to connect only with the mycelium - a huge system encircling the entire planet. The great mother mycelium assigned me the role of a sensor. I periodically got out in the form of a mushroom and collected information about what was happening around. It was a responsible and very interesting mission.\n\nAnd then some big animal ate me. I dissolved into it and learned the way to attach to RNA.\n\nThis opened the way for me to incarnate in the animal kingdom.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQbmG38ApK6R5cFqxsRK6UZ3mrvqYBMowh8Q8c2NN9zir", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaCmy2GKLvP3VWMYkhng3y4DE3t3HpH29Jo4cF7CtrEKs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQbmG38ApK6R5cFqxsRK6UZ3mrvqYBMowh8Q8c2NN9zir", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YxuH9J2fMdEQ3wXX5Fi2dfAapsAJkKBiC"], "tags": ["42", "EndlessHistory", "DigitalArt", "Adventure", "ScienceFiction", "Cryptoapostol6", "Cryptoapostol12", "ArtificialIntelligence"], "extra": {}}
