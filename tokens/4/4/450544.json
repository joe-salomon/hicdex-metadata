One part is looking for an opening to the sky and eternity, the other one is eager to grab onto the ground and is ready to jump.

If one of them wins, the game will be over for everyone.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVUHTJ7rSa92K6j3NV6AcRGqAS759SKTMDoLuTsDjAVAX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNNpoGP3kuKynUjHwtvMSpiUNEcYCzReauD7H1KYuZ13s", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVUHTJ7rSa92K6j3NV6AcRGqAS759SKTMDoLuTsDjAVAX", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1gCp9MxiJh7Gb7M1vSVu6EHCnfBmsENJ96"], "tags": ["sculpture", "body", "nude", "man", "sailors"], "extra": {}}
