You know it wouldn't have been gone for too long. Believe it or not I was inspired by how much I absolutely hate the ads that come up on a YouTube video. You know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. That little box that pops up that says SKIP ADS? So frustratingly annoying. Eventually, I began to see the \"P\" move over to the ADS part. SKIP ADS became SKI PADS. Inspiration presents itself in strange place at strange times. All you need to do is be present to it. So satisfying to see words sharing and caring for each other like this. If only humans could do the same. This is the last BLG. I promise.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmezTDyPQU2yhVVN5EUf3tKCcLRh9zZ4zBiy17GoxbyqAJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPxSBZZ7AGFrfQZKrU26ETHupw3qKXh95gJzXVywpDQnG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmezTDyPQU2yhVVN5EUf3tKCcLRh9zZ4zBiy17GoxbyqAJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
