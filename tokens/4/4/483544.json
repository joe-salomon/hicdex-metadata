I went to the Paran\u00e1 River island, crossing from Rosario, Santa Fe to Victoria, Entre R\u00edos. This is a normal destination for the people here in Ros.\n\nI used my very first 35mm reflex camera, the Canon EF with a 50mm f1.4 lens \u2728\n\nAbout the film, it was an expired cine Fuji Eterna 500T, that's why the color. This film is balanced to be used with tungsten lights (actually u can figure it out because the T in the name), so the outdoor photos takes that cold blue color, good for experimenting, but in that case, I had not idea about that film property.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcmzk3ehqsyS8DZVX8Xi1HYGQd6M9rueB6toAoV2YfE2C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRhLwpQzRTFFkvCEK4CyQfim9JqpVBtfokZX8WVDUDX1T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcmzk3ehqsyS8DZVX8Xi1HYGQd6M9rueB6toAoV2YfE2C", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2PyCMgWAhyWwJjsDh1pFaAABVGPdHkqCya"], "tags": ["film", "analog", "filmphotography", "analogphotography", "35mm", "photography"], "extra": {}}
