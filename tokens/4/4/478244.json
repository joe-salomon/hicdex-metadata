It's just ironic as there's no cure. And I start reflecting on my life. The power I can have. The thought to escape and take control. I'll turn your world into ash and treat you like you're the lamb. You can sit here wallowing in your ignorance. Looking for any reason, you can deny. Because life and death decisions are once yours but the two sisters will no longer hurt me.\n \nIn this series, Ostenrik portrays the contrast of bright neon colours as the struggle one most often has in dealing with Bipolar Disorder. The battle to survive the bewildering highs and lows in the brain turbulence is represented in each bold stroke.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQHWUhaAodcCSqGBFDWogZDMsogcEXMa2JmRprt9X5jDS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPAFRCfm9GYyJf4wgQMv8rYqbohagrDZs1c1Jkhf1rvbP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQHWUhaAodcCSqGBFDWogZDMsogcEXMa2JmRprt9X5jDS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1drUotShUZUMxd9DNk2HpeJ44wtuqNr2Rt"], "tags": ["#NFTs", "#NFTart", "#NFTartist", "#NFT", "#NFTcollectibles", "#cryptoart", "#hicetnunc", "#hen200", "#hen200k", "#hen", "#OBJKT", "#nftart", "#cryptoart", "#NFTcommunity", "#CleanNFT"], "extra": {}}
