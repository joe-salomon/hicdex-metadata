This is my genesis collection.\n\nThe title is inspired by the 1951 TV show \"See It Now\" with Edward R. Murrow. The show featured one of the earliest, if not THE earliest, computer animations on TV. The animation was created with MIT's Whirlwind computer and displayed a simple rasterized message that read: \"HELLO MR. MURROW\"\n\n//\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/opher_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdge24hyssuBsaXZFBdicNsAhCw1zao77asa6kjKSdkvc", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdge24hyssuBsaXZFBdicNsAhCw1zao77asa6kjKSdkvc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdge24hyssuBsaXZFBdicNsAhCw1zao77asa6kjKSdkvc", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2TXi7iyvJbiwdkYmsUnpDyx9pLNMPj71A7"], "tags": ["abstract", "animatedgif", "animation", "art", "collection", "generative", "genesis", "geometric", "gif", "loop", "moving", "mrmurrow", "opher", "retro", "series"], "extra": {}}
