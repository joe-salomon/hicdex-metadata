{"__version": 1, "token_id": 510744, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hemophile", "description": "Entered via: Blood rift #20211105\nPower level: Terror\nSize: 6 - ?? feet/ 1.83 - ??? meters tall\nAspect: Blood\nSecondary Aspects: None\n\nHemophiles are variable-sized demons who start out as flowing, metamorphic pools of blood who can form appendages and tools out of their own body to kill things and absorb their blood, which they use to grow in size. Hemophiles often have no external sensory organs, but apparently can track anything that has hemoglobin, meaning that without sight or hearing they are incredibly efficient predators, able to hunt anything within range. \n\nHemophiles are Terror-level demons, and likely would be categorized as Catastrophes due to their ability to grow to massive size, with seemingly unlimited growth potential. Their only weakness is heat, which coagulates them rapidly and denatures the hemoglobin protein they are able to control at will. Hemophiles often go unnoticed until they grow to a size of a large building, in which their mass is too large to hide, which is the size that most are fought in combat. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUW6xXhBULhjaap7D3auhjt2AJLqpn2YYyjsuwf98rz9E", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTyDgqPMG7boRjEfp64HceimCykTzeWoDNgeeyyi2GCGA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUW6xXhBULhjaap7D3auhjt2AJLqpn2YYyjsuwf98rz9E", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["demon", "blood", "orderofthedarkwheel", "darkwheel", "illustration", "monster", "horror", "horrorart", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
