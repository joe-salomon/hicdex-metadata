Typical of the fifties and sixties, the furnishing was clean and smooth. The art of that period was also very colorful. I started drawing with markers when I was twelve. With an artist mother, art is a part of my DNA. I did the Dansk series in 2018 and never posted it or tried to sell it. It sat on my computer until now. With the advent of NFT's, I went through my work and decided to show the series first. I've minted the series on Hicketnunc, and they will be featured in a London virtual gallery in Oct.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVeqziXFjMzpXrvwMFEfdH6JyxxoE2bXhPTWARaCQuS5a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQUPXzeeH7gX182i9eMNGcCTGd7xZwxM7YEWZXJ9Y4oXc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVeqziXFjMzpXrvwMFEfdH6JyxxoE2bXhPTWARaCQuS5a", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VN4MDWeR8iMWgFtVMpmxpbDZ492hTYWQh"], "tags": ["tezos", "abstract", "digitalpainting", "illustration", "painting", "2d", "tezosabstract", "modernart", "illustrations", "colorful", "bright", "fineart", ""], "extra": {}}
