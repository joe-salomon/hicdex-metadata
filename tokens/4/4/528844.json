I usually use whatever we have at home (scrap papers, cardboards, etc); she also uses food coloring more often than actual watercolor paints because that's what we have laying around. \n\nIf you think the painting's a bit creepy, thank you! I think so too!\n\n\n[mix media, painting on canvas with collage paper & clothing hangtag]\n808 x 1080\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis project is a collaborative & learning platform between a tired mother and her bubbly (almost) 3 years old daughter. Art, Crafts, and Music have always been in her daily activities along with running around the house, helping dad in the studio, and climbing stuff. \n\nSupport our journey into NFT by collecting our creations or connect with us via Twitter. We'd love to make some new friends!\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbj1f3Yfhbpymyb747hMuxHzTv7URL1i6NvBUxJu2sLxr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXm4LQcPLaV4Kt6vY5uBrK7ujyeR9JDunZfA558vGmL3q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbj1f3Yfhbpymyb747hMuxHzTv7URL1i6NvBUxJu2sLxr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHcq4e7QkYpwkAGp9cC6TqMtPsauj8Fed"], "tags": ["nftkid", "kidsontheblockchain", "nftcommunity", "womanincrypto", "itsmondayart", "youngnft", "nftkidsmag", "painting", "collage", "mixmedia"], "extra": {}}
