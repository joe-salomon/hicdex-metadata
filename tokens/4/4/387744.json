So if you have 10 or 20 of em, they will be swapped out for something awesome down the road.\n\nTill then...\n\npeace out", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWfuVPtLSiGt2eAePimyGasBeys3Gowqo6Ybys2txxenx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWj6YEJeWnasnpfMZMvYN7K7GgFsuejJkKsxmi5r9uM1k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWfuVPtLSiGt2eAePimyGasBeys3Gowqo6Ybys2txxenx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ZNZmiTKVkAatCgxbjvRiXcKmip8bgeAeF"], "tags": ["kanemayfield", "rap", "rewind", "music", "poetry"], "extra": {}}
