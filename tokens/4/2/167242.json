Humans, roaming through life searching for happiness, contentment and their one true love. Endlessly seeking satisfaction for their desires, fueled by greed and ego. Looking for happiness in money, material goods and praise from others. Molding their bodies into what society has told us is attractive, rejecting those who don\u2019t fit into that mold of \u2018beauty\u2019 or strength. Gender roles, founded by misogynistic minds and taught to us from birth. Inequality, racism, classism, sexism, all born from the same festering, rotten minds.\n\nIt is time for everyone to break free from the binds that tie them to this cycle of contempt and misery. No one else can break you free, no man, woman, child, god, saviour can set you free. Your words, thoughts, and actions all impact your perception of the world around you. The answers do not lie elsewhere, the answers are already inside you.\n\nBy @DehiscenceArt 2021 Jpg 4200px X 6600px \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbivr7qdAFXsyVVAgtEd7ZgxMEns9N1M3CMGAU6jKvu9u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNQWHLT8ZPr2QVei2Z6yY7pFUdwMfYuWQSqUz3T2KuF29", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbivr7qdAFXsyVVAgtEd7ZgxMEns9N1M3CMGAU6jKvu9u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtZmtxhiWc8Nv6AtC1YjVCtJoFjv4nTqL"], "tags": ["surrealism", "cleannfts", "artwithamessage", "collage", "dystopia", "nftcollectors", "humanity", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
