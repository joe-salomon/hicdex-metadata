It didn\u2019t mind my getting close up with a macro lens and taking a series of detailed photographs. Back at my computer, I mirrored a black and white image, which resembles an X-ray. My diagnosis? A vision of perfect form and beauty.\n\nAbout the View Portal\nThe ring-like portal that frames the image was digitally abstracted from the headlamp of a 1963 Chrysler muscle car. The decorative \u201ctabs\u201d make for a unique presentation of all manner of subjects.\n ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQtziZc9AeFKQ8T3W6QkmvfebCFnAzwTo4ejQzyQgicNT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY32Q8Xk6Ba9gX8A7QF9JfycDEPh5ES6BQX5dpbs9m1s5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQtziZc9AeFKQ8T3W6QkmvfebCFnAzwTo4ejQzyQgicNT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LyqA6KX1sLH2ZcCLTzEnSWiijY4NCiySQ"], "tags": ["macrophotography", "close-up", "prayingmantis", "insect", "portal"], "extra": {}}
