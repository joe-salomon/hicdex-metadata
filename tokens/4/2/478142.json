First time using blender and with about 3 months of self teaching trial and error I can finally release this! This piece is a promo piece intended to tease the product I've been working on for the NFT community. I'm hoping this piece will invoke some feeling of warmth, and nostalgic memories of your childhood as it does for me. I hope to really make a splash with my final product and blur the lines of art, investing, and gaming which is why I've minted so many to make it obtainable as possible! I plan on releasing more teasers and info as I progress but if you're really interested give me a follow on my twitter and feel free to ask me questions! I also later plan to release this piece to a limited 3D OBJKT where the QR codes within will be viewable and accessible. Until then, I really hope you enjoy this piece as much as I do and did creating it!  \n-Wolf", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma8sR3PfSr7TKw4Bm9kAQiGdPbP4iq2CmYBfPjDMVxTqP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdQhNLuwGSPYES2NYgrfudWuSg1icrJ2v7chNopyA4nxn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma8sR3PfSr7TKw4Bm9kAQiGdPbP4iq2CmYBfPjDMVxTqP", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MEyc2U9maSbtvPK3gPMLvpnBHcuFovdFE"], "tags": ["3D", "Animation", "Arcade", "Metaverse", "Future", "Futuristic", "Gif", "Gifart", "Wolf", "Digitalart", "nostalgia", "nostalgic"], "extra": {}}
