The ray of light is not just continuous one, it consists of light and the absence of it. This is the same in all universe, everything has it's opposition. There is no black without white, yes goes with no, one with zero etc. The duality is everywhere and every subject had it's own code, vibration, individuality. My painting is not a physical object , it's a manifestation of the meaning with vibration. In other words the idea got the form and the meaning of this idea reflects following vibration. The language of numbers together with the colours is a consequence of it. Every point,every little piece on the painting is where it supposed to be and it couldn't be somewhere else.\nI am this is a conscious presence. The definition of concept destroys inner awareness of it, because the emptiness become to fulfill.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSdnWq7EggeWatVAVfUSuwLuXwxq9CSh6UxUcCBubfDn4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYVzfLVFjZF9Yv4yR9kq8zdqbjskRhQfoA6X8Z8fhMqWS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSdnWq7EggeWatVAVfUSuwLuXwxq9CSh6UxUcCBubfDn4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gaiPvK3zDFuKJAN3u1vRDsHH4H6KX9z8U"], "tags": ["#hooponopono", "#2d", "#abstract", "#reflection", "#light"], "extra": {}}
