It's art and tech-driven. \n\nCrypto such as, BTC, ETH, ZNN, HEX, TEZOS, now run the world. Community-driven IDO platforms like equinox, gaming platforms like IGG and NFT platforms that offer cross-chain capabilities like Hopped have taken over the world. \n\nThis futuristic street art curation is in Osaka, Japan. You can even donate ETH to the NFT artist who curated the art by scanning a QR code and sending ETH donations. Or simply buy Starseed art on hicetunc. \n\nGive what you please said the artist Starseed, or don't give at all.  It does not matter, only to yourself.  \n\nArt is for all.  Whether you own an NFT or share the beauty, art is changing how we interact with life itself. All is good.  \n\nNFT's are changing the world and artist's lives. Be the change.
