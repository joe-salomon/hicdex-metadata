Is this nonsensical and arbitrary, yes and no. All words are made up. All stories come from some point of genesis. Why can't there be a sentence about Stan, a ship's assistant? We don't know much about him other than he's an assistant on a ship and well, he's not very well liked apparently. I have very specific rules about what I use and don't use. One of these prerequisites is that every letter in the original word has to be used at least once in works like this. The original one was the word DISCOVERY, which interestingly enough was a discovery of this type of phenomenon in the English language.
