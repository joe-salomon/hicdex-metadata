I turn around and saw this tall figure, ragged sandals, dirty dress\u2026 and that beautiful cape covering her head. It was obvious she was trying her best to blend in, I could bet she was wearing the clothes of one of her maids.\n\nWhat was she doing here? What or who was she looking for on this side of the station?\n\nEven though the clothes alone were enough to know something was off, it wasn't only that. The way she walked, her posture, how she talked; it was smart of her trying to say as little as possible, even the way she put her hands on her lap and looked beyond the camera, there was a whole story here, one I wasn\u2019t supposed to know about.\n\nI only wish someone would have told her that stelkat fabric wasn\u2019t sold on the lows. That cape alone could feed one of us for an entire year.\n\nBefore she left she said \u201cThank you\u201d, and nodded her head as the highborn, that we both knew she was, usually does.\n\nCollection \u201cPortraits from Gelo\u201d", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdM955xxE3dYVhXv51YUVHRsmDxvyZGRbo4hDTEPia8d1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTDgqVCxFZyRDhmnG8bwpvrizyMDEBuWYcgbXYbGVmViq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdM955xxE3dYVhXv51YUVHRsmDxvyZGRbo4hDTEPia8d1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YV1KZ9vzqFDpNYRwNZAAMhfx8pVWLH7sT"], "tags": ["Sculpt", "paint", "3D", "space", "gelo"], "extra": {}}
