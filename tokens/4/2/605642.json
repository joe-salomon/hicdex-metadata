It is the fifth song from the debut album, State.\n\nThis song serves as a sonic shift for the album, as it transitions to a warmer and more inviting sound and experience.\n\nThe work and animations featured in the State series represents the rebirth as an artist and is the culmination of five years of work.\n\nThe album and animated series allowed a sense of liberation to create and make the Bases project what it is today. This work serves as the foundation. This is the fifth animation in the series and has been exclusively minted here.\n\nMusic by Darryl Kirchner\nArtwork and Animation by Darryl Kirchner", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSLsp3XZtwjtstiR7jCVyJoKVUZxos7WrHGFHmPfvNvFt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQWE2inHcEwbNN441vzU1xZuV55cFJAU2oKJvPQ7h7fCD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQWE2inHcEwbNN441vzU1xZuV55cFJAU2oKJvPQ7h7fCD", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSLsp3XZtwjtstiR7jCVyJoKVUZxos7WrHGFHmPfvNvFt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1g9wxVbu5EKBeSqeGFoKSBnPKvxJnpKcsw"], "tags": ["animation", "music", "illustration", "glitch", "funk", "geometric", "nostalgia"], "extra": {}}
