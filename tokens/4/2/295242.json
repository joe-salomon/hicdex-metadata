This ridge separates the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, and Iceland is one of the few places on earth that it can be seen above sea level.\n\nThese tectonic plates are divergent, meaning that they are pulling away from each other. As they do so, magma from the mantle rises to fill the space between them in the form of volcanic eruptions. This image comes from an area deep in the barren desolate highlands of Iceland. 2021.
