The one who has always existed and who will never cease to be. He is the one whose existence doesn\u2019t have a beginning nor an end. The virtue of this name signifies Allah as being perpetual, endless, and everlasting. He will remain forever and unaffected by time.\n\nIndeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic. And Allah is better and more enduring. (Quran 20:73)\n\nWhatever you have will end, but what Allah has is lasting. And We will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do (16:96).\n\nAbu Sa\u2019id al-Khudri reported that some people from among the Ansar begged from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) and he gave them. They again begged him and he again gave them, till when what was in his possession was exhausted he said:\n\nWhatever good (riches, goods) I have, I will not withhold it from you. He who refrains from begging Allah safeguards him against want. and he who seeks sufficiency, Allah would keep him in a state of sufficiency, and he who shows endurance. Allah would grant him power to endure, and none is blessed with an endowment better and greater than endurance.
