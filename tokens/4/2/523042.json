I don't consider luck as a passive event, but as something you provoke. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbKw2Q4mQrfsDoF1cgseUGCjzd81LxtmRtB4kreqNgZup", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRZXuTHzJtjE1Kmdz6xubcxtLqCxdcjBzJyv77Vywo71C", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbKw2Q4mQrfsDoF1cgseUGCjzd81LxtmRtB4kreqNgZup", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1KgQPu6JSgppkWCUBcqP9RFYhXKfCeDSG3"], "tags": ["generativeart", "processing", "p5js", "abstract", "abstractart", "algorithmicart", "art", "artoftheday", "codeart", "contemporaryart", "creativecodeart", "design", "digitalart", "generativeartbot", "generativearti", "generativearting", "nft", "generativearts", "generativeartstudio", "generativearttoys", "generativeartvideo", "generativedesign", "geometricart", "glitchart", "illustration", "mathart", "modernart", "motiongraphics", "proceduralart", "visualart", "generativeart", "generativeartist"], "extra": {}}
