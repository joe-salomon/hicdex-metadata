They differ from the other apes by their reddish-brown coat and by their body structure more adapted to a tree-dwelling way of life. They live on the Southeast Asian islands of Sumatra and Borneo; the populations of both islands are now kept as three separate species: Borneo-orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), Sumatra-orangutan (Pongo abelii) and Tapanuli-orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX7i5r1zTMG8U9Sse92eCRsem7TYHEDv62vNMiKDZuZSa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSNWAv5zDYutHHsvMnxZkGWcnhyusHWh9YcB8iBhnqGYQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX7i5r1zTMG8U9Sse92eCRsem7TYHEDv62vNMiKDZuZSa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cYeLzaQ5mPLdJGj4CRdZbWJheFcDtZRtc"], "tags": ["2d", "draw", "drawing", "ape", "monkey", "apes", "monkeys", "orangutan"], "extra": {}}
