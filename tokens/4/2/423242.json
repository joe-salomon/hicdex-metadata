{"__version": 1, "token_id": 423242, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Sandalwood Pony", "description": "The Sandalwood Pony originated in Indonesia, on the Sumba and Sumbawa Islands. It is named after the Sandalwood trees, which are a major export of the country. The Sandalwood pony is one of the finest in the country, partly due to the great amount of Arabian blood. They make suitable children's ponies, and have been exported to Australia for this purpose. They have also been exported to other Southeast Asian countries for use as racing ponies.\n\nThe Sandalwood is used for light draft, pack, farm, and riding work. They are especially popular in horse racing, both on the flat and in harness. They are also used in the bareback races held on the islands, which are often over three miles (4.8 km) long.\n\nSandalwoods have good endurance, and are considered easy to manage. They should have a nice head with small ears, a short, muscular neck, and a deep chest with a sloping shoulder. The back is usually long, and the croup is sloping. The ponies are usually 12\u201313 hands (48\u201352 inches, 122\u2013132 cm) and may be any color.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPaS8iP5ZfNZtLmmB7UgMCDLRoSL2cgt7x2xcsQ7qDLQ5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTCCdK2VkGvVbpjh4BB96vwo6HdV5ghPpapKVoiXdSJ1p", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPaS8iP5ZfNZtLmmB7UgMCDLRoSL2cgt7x2xcsQ7qDLQ5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["sandalwood", "pony", "horse", "animal", "sumba.island", "indonesia", "ranselusang", "adventure", "travel"], "extra": {}}
