I also had to learn every day.\n\nTravel for me was a personal challenge. The first step makes me feel insecure and so anxious. I was afraid and suffering fear about my future. My stomach was hurting initially, and my mind was unsafe until km started to come to me.\n\nThe first place I arrived after exit my country was San Pedro de Atacama. I went up by bike on this road. Tired, I stopped to drink some water and breath, in that moment I turned back and just realized where I was. \n\nI was huge.\n\nThat day I felt how much lucky I was to be there. How lucky I was for the energy that was crossing me.\n\nI learned that I don\u00b4t need so much security to travel cause it will never be enough.\nI just needed to jump and find myself into the adventure.\n\nThat day my body, my soul, my mind were in the same place. I was no longer suffering anymore.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZfPHxXwukJPY9KQvmpdFUemdww1SbapWhyndd112a8Hy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQhxmyddQZZvUaFXw6RLUVgHsmcW6qbNb22ADk6JfQmZ3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZfPHxXwukJPY9KQvmpdFUemdww1SbapWhyndd112a8Hy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ichPK6qRDokxcguriiARTvsLkFzRvoXGp"], "tags": ["mountain", "landscape", "monta\u00f1a", "land", "chile", "sanpedro", "sanpedrodeatacama", "Licancabur", "photo", "foto", "photography", "landscapephotography", "southamerica", "elviajedemisfotos", "juancolacioppo", "travel", "travelphotography", "viajar"], "extra": {}}
