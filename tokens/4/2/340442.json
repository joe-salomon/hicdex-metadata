Thirsting for blood, they maintain personality traits and habits of their past lives, even if they don\u2019t know exactly why they behave as such. While extremely fast and strong, their minds are shattered and often lack dexterity, so often they resort to bladed weapons to hunt.\n\nThese Creepers suffer similar weaknesses as mythological vampires - sunlight burns their skin, and massive damage to their heart (through stake or shotgun blast) can send them back to the Abyssal Void. Be weary that due to their secondary aspect of bone, they have a calciferous buildup around their organs, making them slightly more durable than normal humans.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ8HEL7zc1zNKkGJc8LX2KUcjnbJtab74ka82xeSigqGt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWz9AuTZYPMmENkWj62PEszwmoP23amJv3A6XGxNEBTHc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ8HEL7zc1zNKkGJc8LX2KUcjnbJtab74ka82xeSigqGt", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["blackclawnotwhiteclaw", "unique", "1/1", "vampire", "darkart", "darkwheelnft", "horror", "horrorart", "nosferatu", "undead", "shadow", "blood"], "extra": {}}
