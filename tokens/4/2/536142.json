Known Knowns (are assumptions that have been validated and are now facts) 2. Known Unknowns (are assumptions that we haven\u2019t or can\u2019t validate) 3. Unknown Knowns (are the things that we know, but are unaware of knowing) 4. Unknown Unknowns (are true surprises) As more and more generations of humans progress further than the previous, we are gathering more and more data points of reality. Will we ever figure out and unravel all the mysteries of the universe? Will the Known Unknowns & Unknown Knowns become Known Knowns? How do we look for the Unknown Unknowns if we don't even know about them? Will there ever be a point where all the Unknown Unknowns become Known Knowns as well?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma7AKj5meu1WQhzS2ms2UKhFFFNSMQyPg8FT1vGVX24XR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTDNkFaBtT14j6Gj54emaAHW8NzJkNZyyKacgUePfwFn7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma7AKj5meu1WQhzS2ms2UKhFFFNSMQyPg8FT1vGVX24XR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
