Everyone who tried to reach his cave never returned.\n\nAs protection, the boatmen of the S\u00e3o Francisco started to paint stars on the hulls of the boats or to use figureheads, monstrous sculptures placed on the bow to keep away the Caboclo d'\u00c1gua and evil spirits. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXzhesJ4DNQFk2NPUaA9a4cgqmJw6ELM8TVeyiivYSibN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZPjEZNwxiGXT3MFYNxcREkwktQW3usNn5kDDeTAw5dC7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmbkRQbWVvt4SsmdUZc8JPcaYncQUSL2eWesq6CKSet2Aq", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXzhesJ4DNQFk2NPUaA9a4cgqmJw6ELM8TVeyiivYSibN", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["characters", "legends", "brazil", "cryptolegends", "forest"], "extra": {}}
