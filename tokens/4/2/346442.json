Each method of understanding is less important than the way in which they connect with each other. Art is constantly morphing, but some people just don\u2019t get it, it doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re young or old, progressive or conservative, artists or not. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPDUQ7DNEQ74NSmZkPArLBbfSe85ZrSNVB5wmisqQLczD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXw4e3UgMPHAg2hCLUPAQzox9mHxFpbtK51suM7zhZN7b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPDUQ7DNEQ74NSmZkPArLBbfSe85ZrSNVB5wmisqQLczD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fuWZcRs8nJ91zz5eUcarExf9caC4RxqiJ"], "tags": ["2D", "digitalpainting", "vintage", "banksy", "duchamp", "goya", "macintosh"], "extra": {}}
