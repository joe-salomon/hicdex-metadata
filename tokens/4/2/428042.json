A vibrant structure that has surpassed all need for humanity.\n\n\"Frost Bank:3077\" takes us into the abstract and organic mind of Gadfly through his latest \"Scavenger\" series. These 7 spacelike structures are a methodical deep dive into the depths of visionary geometric abstraction to convey extravagant extraterrestrial compositions. You will notice a blending of the digital and contemporary schools of thought as Gadfly is an artist that has immersed himself in all walks of creative professional life for over the past decade. With more uploads coming soon, you can become a collector of this emerging NFT artist before animated versions of their \"Scavenger\" series are dropped further down the road. \n\nStay tuned. Much Love\nGadfly", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbE69Poa4VPS1AMrHSbGcey11RhdVYPfo5jYuEFctozXD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmccsEfumxehPU66Ldv9Dx3X3jumkK1xbAzYUYJWu2TmoM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbE69Poa4VPS1AMrHSbGcey11RhdVYPfo5jYuEFctozXD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WTF7wYBLC9rUwVz72B1HiGFv9b6UqJWbE"], "tags": ["gadfly", "gadflysworld", "geometric", "abstract", "geometricabstraction", "space", "spaceart", "spaceship", "portal", "teleporation", "fineart", "fineartist", "illustration", "digitalillustration", "sketch", "alien", "saturn", "orb", "circle", "meditation", "yoga", "visionary", "visionaryart"], "extra": {}}
