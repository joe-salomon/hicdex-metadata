To create a TRADITIONAL collage art specifically DESIGNED AS A 1/1 NFT. This is my thought process;\n \nTHOUGHT 01\nI feel guilty minting a 1/1 artwork but can be sold twice; 1st is the scanned digital 1/1 version bought using tezos, second is physically IRL bought using FIAT. I think its weird coz my art is now legit on 2 different universe. For me, it is no longer a 1/1\n\nIN MY POV, scanning a Monalisa & own it\u2019s jpg doesn\u2019t make me own a Monalisa. A Monalisa is a physical thing, therefor the ownership, uniqueness & rarity is legit only IRL. So what about art that I made? one that are created traditionally but sold as an NFT? Its rarity is questionable. IF the owner of the physical Monalisa decide to mint it\u2019s scanned JPG as a 1/1 later on to be bought by another person, then the rarity is no longer 1/1. It becomes a 1/2 . Half is in the physical universe, the other half is in the blockchain. \n\nTHOUGHT 02\nI need to reduce my time cost (this purpose is personal because my technique cost me a lot of time. For the value I usually gain selling it as NFT, it is Ineffective) I need to find a solution other than \u201craising the price\u201d or \u201cdecreasing the quality/size\u201d\n\nHOW TO EXERCISE THOUGHT 01 & 02 AT ONCE?\nBy trying to emulate the experience that ppl have when they buy art physically in a gallery. By design my own, new NFT creation process.\n\nBASE TRUTH:\nOnce an art bought IRL, the art will no longer exist in the artist\u2019s studio. It's moving to a collector\u2019s wall. The artist needs to go to the collector\u2019s house to witness their own art again.\n\nMY SOLUTION:\nInstead of arranging trash on a canvas board, try to control & stick 'em with glue (creating a permanent arrangement of materials which will produce a physical form of thing I call art) I decided to believe in momentum & chance this time. I arrange my paper trash materials directly ON the scanner upside down and see how it goes. Mint the JPG then delete the file from the hard drive forever\n\nTHE RESULT:\n3 unique 1/1 collage art in a form of a JPG that ONLY exists on the chain. These NFTs are made using hand but it has no physical trace & existence. Not sticking the materials together with glue on a canvas board is DISPOSING the arrangement right after scanning. At this point, the physical trace of an artwork is removed. Time cost here also greatly reduced.\n\nAs an add on, I also delete the file. This one you can only rely on my honesty. hehe. I will only have a save-as-version of my own artwork after this is minted.\n(ATTACHMENT : SCREEN RECORD MINTING & DELETING FILE)\n\nI think the existence of an art on the chain & in real life is an interesting topic & logic for me to explore as a traditional-native artist.\n\nI\u2019m only trying to legitimise the uniqueness of an art I release, try to make it really 1/1, really moving it to a node when I mint it, but keep using the same material, because my purpose as an artist is still the same; I turn trash into treasure \u2728\n  \u2028This way I now really create, mint, and then letting my art travel from one to another wallet. It\u2019s just like usual, but refined. Retweet the first tweet of this thread if you think this is an interesting experiment & topic.\n\n\nTRASHCAN 01 - 03\nAnalog Collage Art 1/1 NFT made by \n@elsadiora\n\n21/11/21\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQcFsjNWVG6WwfdETrm3ibUULHFhzzQCSoDMkmM8yEWse", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdXQ1Q93ocpg1hsDniqqMpASiW4qbqgiGBMvUDGB8antS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQcFsjNWVG6WwfdETrm3ibUULHFhzzQCSoDMkmM8yEWse", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MTnNuKrSpz3WXsrCMZoX9Pb8N69bEVoDT"], "tags": ["CollageArt", "1/1", "Rare", "TrashArt", "Recycle"], "extra": {}}
