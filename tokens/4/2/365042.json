All the patterns will have written on them - pointless patterns or PP, just a fun thing to add to the whole collection. I believe, art is for anyone and everyone. When you let go of yourself in the process of creating you actually meet yourself and I embrace this meeting everyday.  I intent to publish patterns everyday from my practice as a reminder to self and everyone that art is too important not to be celebrated.
