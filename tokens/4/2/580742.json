It was located in front of the altar at the end of the central aisle, giving the impression that the angel greeted the visitors, making them a part of the community through baptism. It was later replaced by a kneeling angel in front of a monumental figure of Christ with open arms. Thorvaldsen was, in addition to Antonio Canova, the foremost sculptor of his time.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVin1vbwnYMg6ppQh87FwVMiinCHjhtvrFJfKrUzshf44", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbxRBmiSLx3e2TiYFjSux2DsDMjEDYg7Lq5mSLVT2RX1F", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVin1vbwnYMg6ppQh87FwVMiinCHjhtvrFJfKrUzshf44", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MwbPYK7vbCUQ7ADdbvq8eYkiRBydxKzLk"], "tags": ["nft", "nfts", "statue", "light", "calm", "color", "cinema4d", "vfx", "blender", "3dart", ""], "extra": {}}
