These particles could be atoms, stars, or fluid components and so the method is applicable to many fields, including molecular dynamics and astrophysics. The basic principle is that a system of particles is converted into a grid (or \"mesh\") of density values. The potential is then solved for this density grid, and forces are applied to each particle based on what cell it is in, and where in the cell it lies.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeib2ifiaivlfnhpkrco26jdvjd4djsqpmpmc4vhf3urczfucn3eef4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeib2ifiaivlfnhpkrco26jdvjd4djsqpmpmc4vhf3urczfucn3eef4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeib2ifiaivlfnhpkrco26jdvjd4djsqpmpmc4vhf3urczfucn3eef4", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2N9gjEFptEVckxqupDCjK61BjSRCkMQLmJ"], "tags": ["Boids", "Particles", "Generativeart", "GPU", "Creativecoding", "Programming", "Javascript"], "extra": {}}
