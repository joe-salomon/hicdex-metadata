I came upon the word MANDAMUS and was spellbound by it's bizarre phonetics as well as its definition. One might say I was amused by it. Oh wait...those words go together! Let's see what happens. The result of this marriage of amusement is: AN AMUSED MAN AND A USED MUSE. The man is myself and the muse is the word MANDAMUS. Sounds harsh to use the words USED MUSE, but when you think of it...the reflection towards creation is one sided; MANDAMUS isn't inspired by anything I put to it, it's just a word.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbcbnmQZw77deJZZ63bUBYJuVnvKdA46fkt4AztCZNcXq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWuHSGJQv9H3WLftKNWJ7fSANGzZCos8t1cSSytL569qm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbcbnmQZw77deJZZ63bUBYJuVnvKdA46fkt4AztCZNcXq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
