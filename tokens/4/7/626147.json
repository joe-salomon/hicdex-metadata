{"__version": 1, "token_id": 626147, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ASTRO HERBAL", "description": "\"Astro Herbal: Using Divine Timing to Craft Medicine\" explores the synergy between astrology and natural remedies and focuses primarily on how to use astrology to make medicine. It's part handbook, part philosophy about the nature of reality and how astrology can be used when formulating handcrafted medicines, namely herbal tinctures and gem/flower essences, to make them more potent. The short ebook also includes recipes and a reference table of zodiac signs and planetary energies. I have studied astrology for more than 20 years and incorporate it into every area of my life. Letting it inform my process for making tinctures is one of my favorite ways to utilize the energies. 22 page ebook.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWWabCZWDW8yfbcgBxk5bCnvFSYJWd1Narg2ksM8jqKLw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaYURF1Lek5xboDh2tA9pAHrUxcXjQgACJztKVXCuzgYM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmaYURF1Lek5xboDh2tA9pAHrUxcXjQgACJztKVXCuzgYM", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWWabCZWDW8yfbcgBxk5bCnvFSYJWd1Narg2ksM8jqKLw", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1PxVVt4QFFxPWDq5a8qDmp2SUVJbU1PGUP"], "tags": ["ebook", "pdf", "digital", "astrology", "herbalism", "crystals", "health", "healing", "wellness", "recipes"], "extra": {}}
