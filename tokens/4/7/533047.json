{"__version": 1, "token_id": 533047, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Metacreatura #3 - Stygian Arachnidax Hex", "description": "The Stygian Arachnidax Hex is one of the six-legged species of the Metamorph species that lives in the sparkling barren land, the land called the Shimmermist Valley. This creature has an egg-like shape which he uses to digest the light he gets from hunting other light-eating creatures. He has 6 legs and 2 antennae which he uses to detect the presence of other creatures around him. While the 2 legs in front of him are used to hunt other creatures as well as to defend themselves from other, more vicious predators. His shiny scales are the result of radiation from his body's digestion as a light-consuming.\n\nThe Stygian Arachnidax Hex is the third subspecies of the Metacreatura species to appear in the Metacreatura series.\n\nAnimation : Faturwz                                                                                                \nScoring works : CHLVN\nFile size : 63 Mb\nFile format: MP4\nVideo duration : 00:13 Seconds\nFrame rate: 59.94 f/s\n2000x2000 pixels\nBit rate : 317kbps\nAudio sample rate : 48.000kHz", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPj5PsQM1tk51XCdGg3ea8aSjTQbV12zxNG6LVgo1ViCj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfKTzmHUbW9Tg55Z9zXFxZRdkzXC3nBxXoTjbqVkHYsW2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPj5PsQM1tk51XCdGg3ea8aSjTQbV12zxNG6LVgo1ViCj", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1churhR6VtAr5cWWiKrAxMgBEY4uMi9AJt"], "tags": ["asia", "3d", "creature", "3dillustration", "metacreatura", "faturwz", "alienworld", "sci-fi", "indonesia", ""], "extra": {}}
