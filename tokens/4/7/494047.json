Most people leave her consultations 97% upset and 3% hungry, but in the long run they agree with her and recommend her.\n\nOlga is a fervent follower of Peppology, her favorite Peppo being the Peppo of Intuition(1). She has a collection of thousands of different figures of this Peppo in different situations and there are those who say that her divinatory powers are the result of a pact between her and this Peppo. But this has never been proven.\n\nShe always says that her artistic name is in honor of the boa constrictor that strangled Queen Verena(2), because it seemed to her the greatest poetic act in the history of the country, together with the disappearance of her friend the poet Cirilo Sansebiera(3).\n\n1 See OBJKT #415410\n2 See OBJKT #326973\n3 See OBJKT #240242\n\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeZC7mDdfHL9WuLbDV1R5SCQ11NfKXh8TNMnjCWKJCz8V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdPMsjAz9mLdGV9ttMmWoMyYj7jpCW2mQk7vWJFFhLh8M", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeZC7mDdfHL9WuLbDV1R5SCQ11NfKXh8TNMnjCWKJCz8V", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Stamp", "Witch", "Fortuneteller"], "extra": {}}
