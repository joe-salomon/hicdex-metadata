They don\u2019t have eyes, but navigate through both sound and vibrations (able to lock onto the elevated heartbeats of humans running from it) from the two fleshy appendages on its head. These two appendages also act as proxy arms, grasping prey once it's been immobilized by the Shambler\u2019s venomous stinger filled with fast-acting paralytic compounds.\n\nDark Shamblers are Creeper-level demons that move slightly slower than the average human\u2019s run, but have tremendous stamina and will usually outlast prey in a hunt; it\u2019s tremendous torso crashing into and through most static obstacles. That said, due to their lack of sight and relative carelessness in which they move, they are more vulnerable to traps, especially those that target their thin legs. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbUH1eGTQLDEK3PHPtQo4VWFCLEeUe9E1Yrn91CvcYkuX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU7aP26THwfXWKyqFWXH6ByUXkq9vaT5ovpSZ1TrekGot", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbUH1eGTQLDEK3PHPtQo4VWFCLEeUe9E1Yrn91CvcYkuX", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["darkwheel", "darkart", "horror", "horrorart", "illustration", "digital", "creature", "monster", "demon", "creeper"], "extra": {}}
