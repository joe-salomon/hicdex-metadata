I was a little lost but pushed by the flow towards it. In front of it the crowd began to pull ropes and open the box. Inside there was a gigantic ogre full of colors and smallpox starving and licking his lips; the crowd began to move away as I stood alone in front of the ogre, the size of his shoes, and then the hunt began... The massive crowd who lined up as 2 magnetic blocs, lurking, clucking and screaming, was even more frightful than the 3 headed ogre... and we never run as fast as we want in dreams.\n\nThis is the first of 3 on this nightmare, and my giveaway for the 500 milestone.\n\nAquatint etching.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPeAtTtW4imdtfqut2ss78LFGFJL63vpf7exgKRhieRBn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXnL7wD8Y8hqG4zrdwzvzgtfJMequL28LmTEuGJxj2puw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPeAtTtW4imdtfqut2ss78LFGFJL63vpf7exgKRhieRBn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RTyG19vPkLKBghpvn14gzkJNfqDuNiBFu"], "tags": ["aquatint", "etching", "jeansaucisse", "demophobic", "grotesque", "nightmare", "childhood", "recurringdreams", "giveaway"], "extra": {}}
