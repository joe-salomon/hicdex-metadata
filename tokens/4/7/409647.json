As I trace songlines on the rock face I think of those who came before me. I think of how they would want us to connect to songlines once more.\n\n(Songlines\u00a0trace the journeys of ancestral spirits as they created the land, animals and lore. Integral to Aboriginal spirituality, songlines are deeply tied to the Australian landscape and provide important knowledge, cultural values and wisdom to Indigenous people.)\n\nThis artwork is an animated photograph of wool and silk felt, made using wet feeling methods.
