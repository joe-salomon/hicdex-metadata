We say things like: \u2018I want to conquer you\u2019 meaning \u2018I love you, and want you to love me in return.\u2019\n\nI think this a funny way to describe love because the realm of love relationships is perhaps the most colonised ones, no?\n\nWe are always told how to love, who to love and who not to love. \n\nThis painting consequently tells the tale of my complex love life. I am a recovering codependent and I feel stuck every time \u2018I am in love\u2019 because I simply cannot be myself.\n\nI am addicted to love because I am trying to fill in a void of rejection caused by my parents. I want to be loved.\n\nLove is a power dynamics game and soon one of us will be beheaded. \nRipped apart. \n\nI guess in this inevitable tension that comes with love, all we can hope for is to be the ones holding the head.\n\nThis painting is a homage to all men that I loved.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to love you because nobody loved me.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdaNZVuy9uxp5PFTqgtAJwF2NEEmYDFvWRcVuzEnrLEoA", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1Je4gPS5GM2rMrHtoojQWrdz5LcqZm2eNnveDZeNiL7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdaNZVuy9uxp5PFTqgtAJwF2NEEmYDFvWRcVuzEnrLEoA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eoHcb3MpXZ9uJMZwQpAQ1wfmzAWuiGSSP"], "tags": ["painting", "gouache", "love", "brazilianartist", "halloween", "macabre", "scary"], "extra": {}}
