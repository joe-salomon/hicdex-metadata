I have no doubt that the crash between Max Verstappen & Lewis Hamilton will be remembered and replayed for ages. I remember the crash looked absolutely shocking because the Redbull basically landed on Lewis's head. I have no doubt that the Halo saved Lewis's life that day.\n\nI decided to make a watercolor painting to capture the moment & then decided to add a bit of movement to it for the NFT version. I went with a slower movement, because a lot of the times when people experiece something this adrenaline packed, they experience it in what feels like slow motion.\n\nThe original watercolor painting is 11in x17in, and it's the largest watercolor I've painted so far.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZuw5tt5NnLgN8aNBdNCtb8a9LDKjiVuDqBoTMHGfCsjB", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdr86ZHi6TKUsRnXmWNRVGcX2h6Gjw8EUzVJnPCkXrRBa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZuw5tt5NnLgN8aNBdNCtb8a9LDKjiVuDqBoTMHGfCsjB", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FVz6wsw5ZCwzN4vj5kD7fVS1KRkVTV2Lj"], "tags": ["redbullracinglewishamilton", "formula1", "watercolor", "italiangp", "maxverstappen", "mercedesamg", "monza", "f1", "mercedes", "redbull"], "extra": {}}
