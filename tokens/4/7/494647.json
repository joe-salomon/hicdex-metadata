I'm obsessed with typography. Most Graphic Designers probably have some inner connection to letter forms and that is why I take so many pictures of signs and advertising. In the case of these specific characters they are from a poster that I bought from Hatch Show Print in 2004. My affinity for lettering is also probably why I had a scan of my NY license plate that I surrendered to the DMV in Georgia over 15 years ago as well.
