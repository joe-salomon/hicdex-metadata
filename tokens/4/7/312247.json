He hides underneath the snow to prey on his victims, for hours, sometimes even for days. He has every little detail about your life in his briefcase, he knows what you bought, he knows what burner phone you used, he knows about that stolen credit card. He won't let you get away. \nYou can try to get away but it is not recommended. He can unhinge his jaw like a snake, swallowing you whole. You will either repay your debt so he can get his job done and pay for his next meal or you will become the meal yourself. It's nice to have a choice.
