Her gang joked that she was his mother, and took it seriously when Argus grew up.\n \nLater, she adores Argus as her loyal companion and when she left the gang he went with her. She expects him to live longer than her and find a new partner in the future. \n\nRuthless and efficient, unconstrained by the principles of death and fatigue, Argus ruthlessly pursues his prey, ready to destroy anything that may provide refuge to fugitive creatures.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUKsjEr2hFxkpTQE2KwYG653egsPFZAbFt5iGZN4XJy66", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXsgBfPZVJxSrtk669tVx2wycUJVxQzxSGo5uHbA8d3DA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUKsjEr2hFxkpTQE2KwYG653egsPFZAbFt5iGZN4XJy66", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1a7xnv9BUepaRtcna2xxawZsC2w86eh4FF"], "tags": ["CrimsonDiatrix"], "extra": {}}
