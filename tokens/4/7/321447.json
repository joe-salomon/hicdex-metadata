All artworks are created using custom algorithms in processing.\nThis collection has an abstract look at Iranian carpets, Iranian art-industrial carpets that have long overshadowed Iranian culture as a name and credit for Iran.\n\nOriginally, the roots of the kilim rug go back to the nomadic people of the Middle East. They served and still serve the nomads not necessarily as rugs, but rather as blankets, saddle blankets, seat mats, or wall decorations. It is believed that the first carpets in history, several hundred years before Christ, corresponded in many ways to today's kilim carpets. Since the original kilims are hand-woven, they also have a very important difference from knotted carpets. Knotting techniques have presumably only evolved from weaving techniques. Nowadays, kilims mostly originate from southern Iran or Afghanistan.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmehZ9XPjQi7SaueA9P19JB7igMmWo3iQjYgQjbNKC4MzX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmehZ9XPjQi7SaueA9P19JB7igMmWo3iQjYgQjbNKC4MzX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmehZ9XPjQi7SaueA9P19JB7igMmWo3iQjYgQjbNKC4MzX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SSCjgL54U5yUemQVFGfZ9M9ygKHLHgNsA"], "tags": ["generativeart", "creativecoding", "generative", "codeart", "newmediaart", "abstract", "creativecodeart", "algorithmicart", "touchdesigner", "object4objekt", "generativedesign", "processing", "mathart", "computerart", "proceduralart", "geometricart", "procedural", "isometric", "bhfyp", "geometry", "pattern", "GEOMATIC", "aiart", "artxcode", "minimal", "psychedelic", "glsl", "psychedelicart", "opart", "genartclub", "noise", "trippy", "opticalart", "artandtechnology", "coding", "audiovisual", "pyton", "p5js", "hen200k", "shahrokh", "BLACK&WHITE", "pixelart", "pixels", "rare", "1"], "extra": {}}
