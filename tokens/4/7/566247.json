IX", "description": "Anagrams always astound me by their simplicity, coordinated randomness, and ultimately their sheer brilliance. In this case, there are three lines of these qualities to go through and take in. Americans (for the most part) love to talk about politics (especially how they don't like the other side.) Psssssst...both sides do it. It's one of the reasons why we are in the political stalemate we've been stuck in for like 30 years. We have \"CONVERSATIONS\" that are just \"VOICES RANT ON\" and we each seem like we never get anywhere when talking to the other side so we start the process of \"CONSERVATION\" for our hearts and minds to only start up the conversations all over again. It's a vicious cycle that plays out every single day in America. People yelling and screaming at each other and no one listening. Though I might sound a little biased here, but to be candid, after the election if I meet someone that says they either voted for Trump again or still supports him...I stop the conversation and walk away. It's honestly not worth my time and/or effort. He's low hanging fruit at this point.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPymM9Ai5CvBEoBzqojcN8YW6mGej7bBMz7mdxR8SKesu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV1zZtZt3HwP9kF8hoYJXVGhvHFh2FqCkZq2hEY59ugEq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPymM9Ai5CvBEoBzqojcN8YW6mGej7bBMz7mdxR8SKesu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
