Since then, I\u2019ve tried to recognize the struggle that my fellow female game developers have to endure in the games industry, felt apprehensive for the women of Afghanistan under the country\u2019s new leadership, and have been dumbfounded by the recent decisions on abortion in Texas by the very same Supreme Court that RBG presided in. These events make this piece all the more resonant to me and makes it more imperative to highlight RBG\u2019s legacy and what she did for women\u2019s rights.\n\nSeptember 18th is the anniversary of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s death, I\u2019m donating all proceeds (minus an amount set aside for gas fees) from this piece to the Malala Fund, an organization founded by Malala Yousafzai to champion girl\u2019s education in developing countries like Afghanistan.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQsd7TjxrWD6ncCuTwnszpBaPag8Q5YGjwRnc5CW5f2bs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmakABxwTgpjaWmqudfu519m6xE3BJJGvmgvFArmUWnzvA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQsd7TjxrWD6ncCuTwnszpBaPag8Q5YGjwRnc5CW5f2bs", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Yzr4bx7XTPHnp4J2S9wcgjrfxidZPzvVh"], "tags": ["pixel", "animation", "art"], "extra": {}}
