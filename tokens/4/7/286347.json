A study of hands and gestures in computational art. This is part of a set of two \u2014 the other is (Take/Give), from my solo show in 2010. Hand gestures have many meanings, but also real consequences. They can give, take; strike, caress.  From a series of works using computer vision software to detect and draw hands which were then live drawn as part of a performance using extruded strokes and a drawing pen. Rendered first using livecoding system Fluxus and then rendered using Blender (for some nice ray-tracing).
