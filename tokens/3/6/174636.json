{"__version": 1, "token_id": 174636, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Binary I", "description": "The Binary Project The vision for binary is to take incredibly complex shapes and use only black and white as seen through the fractal patterns. Each NFT will use binary code for the title I to IOIOO (1 - 20). Each fractal will be animated with its own soundscape. I see the project as a metaphor for how many view the world in black or white, but if you look at the subject for any amount of time you will see shades of grey, multiple shapes and points of interest. \n\nScarcity will escalate as we approach the final in the series. This will be done by transposing the binary code numbers to their Arabic numeral counterparts in inverse order. Ex: Binary I should have 10,100 editions, but due to HEN limitations it will only have 10,000. Item ten will have 1010 editions. Item 20 will only have 1.\n\nThis NFT is Binary I. If this NFT sells out of all editions, a random drawing will determine which collector wins an acrylic print as a physical token. Obviously, the more NFT editions you purchase the more chances there are to win. But again, the drawing only occurs if all editions sell.
