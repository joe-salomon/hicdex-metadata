I was inconsolable at the time. I drank very heavily, put lots of poison in my blood. I was in London which makes the Oxford Street reference relatable. And I couldn't believe she was gone.\n\nI have come out of it all the other side now and am much happier\n\ndigital painting 4014 x 1334 px \n\nPersonal use only, For commercial use please\ncontact me through social media.\ntwitter   : @bebewahyu \ninstagram : @bebewahyu", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR9kuKu1hwZU5jpyst7oxjodwKi8EpVBfCSFvwC5arm7R", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdwXLcXPvEgUPHQb2t7vt7QmdnX1BLfEw6DszTULBZDzM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR9kuKu1hwZU5jpyst7oxjodwKi8EpVBfCSFvwC5arm7R", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2QQpK8ZtKm9Gh1chEqsNXkyrXSjNFj4VmL"], "tags": ["painting", "surrealism", "art", "surreal", "illustration", "Christmas", "bebewahyu", ""], "extra": {}}
