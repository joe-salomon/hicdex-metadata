A collage is defined as a combination or collection of various things. With that definition you could say that my artistic aesthetic is a collage of Graphic Design, Street, and Pop Art, all of which I hold dear to my heart. Day 29 is leaning hard towards Pop Art but instead of a soup can, I've featured another iconic symbol of our times. The Nike Dunk. Mic drop.
