At the center we have the face of a human being with its working mechanisms on display, small pieces, all of them important for a good functioning and connection with a fish, bringing the idea of \u200b\u200bswimming or floating in a transparent book that is brought by the hand system, causing the fish to create its own storm. We have musical keys in motion bringing the creative symphony, building blocks so that we never forget the inner and pure child who falls asleep in living adults.\n\nYear: 2018 | Technique: Black pen on paper\n\nThis artwork is from a limited edition of 10 prints\nPrinted in UltraChrome HD mineral pigment - Epson\n297x420 mm Hahnem\u00fchle Museum Etching 350g\nWagner Possati - Brazil - S\u00e3o Paulo 2020\n\n3508x4961pixels | .jpg | 96dpi | 11.9 MB\n\nThis art is part of a collection of 4 works released by Gallery Visionariom Art.\nThis NFT was generated as a gift from a physical work.\nwww.visionariom.com\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXLVbiUzaVuFKH7YBWeBpn4vt9zxJi4JoepbezS8A99V6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSHM2KNj6ocdEk2WMp9hux7mygJCWt3Pc5bmhVZn2LfTv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXLVbiUzaVuFKH7YBWeBpn4vt9zxJi4JoepbezS8A99V6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RbevQhPbo6mfBW9mrmNZzju5hHrpaG5QP"], "tags": ["wagnerroza", "obrjkt", "molecules", "visionariom", "visionariomgallery", "brazil"], "extra": {}}
