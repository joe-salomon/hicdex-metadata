I just think that it is the most beautiful means of locomotion that we invented. The effort-benefit ratio is so great that I can't find a comparable one. \n\nI created this work when I spent my first 14 days isolated in quarantine. 30 days after the health emergency was declared in Argentina. I missed riding my bike so much that I needed to dedicate something special to it at the time.\nThe maritime environment arises from the inability and desire to cross the Atlantic due to the world situation. I went to visit my family in Argentina and could not return to Barcelona, where I was living.\n\nEnjoy the ride!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUqgM6xnMTc8rq4aoqM8PMQ77yV6Xzx91hDH4kxdVkCcv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW4nnaz2qs3gmwbpePP3dRBAfJRjRgjFacTFHznSq214s", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUqgM6xnMTc8rq4aoqM8PMQ77yV6Xzx91hDH4kxdVkCcv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gDBqRBYZSUJiXdDd5ngdQ5pgiGn85Vk5G"], "tags": ["3d", "bike", "bridge", "sea", "sun", "objectdesign", "translucent", "cloud", "blue", "yellow"], "extra": {}}
