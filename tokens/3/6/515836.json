{"__version": 1, "token_id": 515836, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Birth Of Shinta ", "description": "This is a poem written in Indonesian language about the birth of Shinta or Sita; the main woman character of the Epic Ramayana. She is the heroine, the glue, the rock that strengthen all the relationship of the characters in the epic. \n\nHer stories written in many versions. But my favorite one tells that she is the reincarnation of Widawati, a goddess who is greatly desired by Rahwana. Almost being molested by him, she burned herself and she took an oath that she will be back on earth and reincarnated to be the most beautiful being that once will end Rahwana's life.\n\nAnother version said that Shinta is actually Rahwana's own daughter who was exiled from heaven to earth by her own mother for the sake of her life. \n\nBy those many versions, the most believed story is where Shinta, as a baby, was found by Janaka, the king of Mantili, in a ploughed field and he believed that God of Earth has sent this baby to him, and then she soon to be adopted & brought up by him and his wife, Sunayana.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmStCBTtgDB6FeNq4vExEarMwXV94CWxcBEzFKcV3jFeej", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdy3xXXtmp4ieeGdvGYcQgUtjLAUGCFihKTvZqJCfB61L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmStCBTtgDB6FeNq4vExEarMwXV94CWxcBEzFKcV3jFeej", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XSa1ZQ8ECTUL7dwEZKbpqoCs52My3Mnhx"], "tags": ["writing", "wayang", "indonesianwriter", "text-basedart"], "extra": {}}
