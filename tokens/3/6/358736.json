Fast forward almost 30 years, he has not only proven himself as an entertainer but also as a true poet. When listening to \"Bright Horses\" or \"Push the Sky away\" I get goosebumps every time. So just like Florence Welch, Nick Cave is my personal Golden Standard for music.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQH1xM5XycNuMvVURMQVDvKPUgzLyzGXf8Uj9TitFwTom", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP57dYKk4umdGioQXNSaEZ8bQZ9gjqpPhkqdjKGf986ev", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQH1xM5XycNuMvVURMQVDvKPUgzLyzGXf8Uj9TitFwTom", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XmGohiAZDKfC6SMUr8AG5XoRAuDzwQJA5"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
