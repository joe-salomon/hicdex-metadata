{"__version": 1, "token_id": 635036, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Alchemy", "description": "Alchemy (from Arabic: al-k\u012bmiy\u0101; from Ancient Greek: khume\u00eda)is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practiced in China, India, the Muslim world, and Europe.\nIn its Western form, alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in Greco-Roman Egypt during the first few centuries CE.\n\nAlchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. Literary alchemy appears throughout the history of English literature like Shakespeare. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus.\n\nVisual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. \nMusic was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. \nIn the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.\n\n\n\n\n2100*1400", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc41WxJPorfHE2EzHona1Lb96xzipZneqejLJ9FM1d3qx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfCFYJtVPVFDyGtn2cfMTtG5crQSF3veZBaGNgWvBbEyN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc41WxJPorfHE2EzHona1Lb96xzipZneqejLJ9FM1d3qx", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Zrzs1sC9BHbRwtDgFrNC4fkZ5cXMw83ch"], "tags": ["codeart", "generativeart", "minimalart", "abstract", "mathart", "psychedelic", "minimal", "nft", "cleannft", "nftcollector", "python"], "extra": {}}
