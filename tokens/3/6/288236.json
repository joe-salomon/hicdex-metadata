I think so, after forty-nine eternal days or something similar, that is, the time here one does not feel, why do I keep thinking? without day or night, without you ... What will it be like to feel warm again? Or the wind from the ocean? Or the crackle of the fire? the roots in the earth, will everything continue to exist?
