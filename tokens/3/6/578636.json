Landing tricks is an incredible feeling. Deep thought, hard fought. I loved the feeling of this trick so much I had to sketch it.  \n\nAlways loved drawing for fun and creative release. I love the process of creating, whatever it is. And drawing and making art has been a huge part of my life lately. Losing myself in art to find myself in life. This piece is mixed medium on the back of my sketchbook.
