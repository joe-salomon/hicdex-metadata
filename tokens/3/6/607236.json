The static and unchanging nature of mountain ranges is described in our geographical atlases up to our design drawings by means of contour lines.  \nHorizontal sections of the terrain, these iso-altimetric curves identify and extract stable planes along which potential energy is constant and deny movement and transformation. \nIf the landscape is suddenly liquid, another representation model is needed to identify the new qualities of the changing territory. \n\nThe maximum slope line is now the most appropriate representation for these dynamic territories in constant change. The maximum slope line between two iso-altimetric curves is the trajectory that the melting snows will naturally want to follow on their descent into the valley. Naturally structured into networks that branch, bifurcate and converge, they are the dynamic and iridescent representation of a territory in constant and profound transformation, with iridescent and changing properties.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeYvBaPahbycatcdPjHAHcBUo8wPpweHZ8Eq4uSkCuRBG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQBrx16KBtZ9YKWVGNmE2eZ1HxruDjtHroe3AhBAURQsJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeYvBaPahbycatcdPjHAHcBUo8wPpweHZ8Eq4uSkCuRBG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1X7VFPpnRr8GxEAzb2WrfVAxLxo1KZD2xK"], "tags": ["#digital#algorithmic#landscape#topography"], "extra": {}}
