A Random Thoughts Collection)", "description": "We are created by the most high with a duality, the good and the bad. We can't live with just one side of it, that's why we need to make it balance. As an artist we make clear intentions, so people surround us, don't having a mistake or a misjudgment. Our arts and creations do the talk for us but we don't care what the negative things thought the people around us. We, the creators of our own reality living in our imaginations and thoughts. Surpassing our limits as a human we create our future. Lastly, just don't drown out of it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPG6aC7r1Dz7xfswLLJQvNBQjSBrKubUiZWCPc2WNnpR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSnnLrDZ1NssxRhN6gT6UKcwHEdb2k754znQ9XpDefihL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPG6aC7r1Dz7xfswLLJQvNBQjSBrKubUiZWCPc2WNnpR", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1heaGRmjzM5c2V7MvbCkwcQNqGvL7FuD8k"], "tags": ["mask", "illustrations", "digitalarts", "halftones", "dualityofaman", "nfts", "nftasia"], "extra": {}}
