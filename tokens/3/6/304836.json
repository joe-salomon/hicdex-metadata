Hard liquor and fist fighting forever!\nA rebel amongst rebels, Sneakyfeet Lightfinger broke the rules of plunder by stealing The Huntsman, a devastatingly accurate sniper rifle, from Black Vince: the weapon came as a set with The Orange Duc. At a Court Pirata presided over by Captain Panik, it was decided that he could keep the rifle as he had successfully stolen it from a comrade who should have protected his own booty from footpads and burglars, but as with a ranged capability of that magnitude his sneaking days were over as he had misused them. His sentence was to be cut in half at the waist by Clawhammer, his legs replaced by clanking iron prosthetics. Sneakyfeet Lightfinger was dead. Nickelass Tinshins was born.\nStill a member of the Ol\u2019 Crow Crew but no longer welcome at The Crow\u2019s Nest, Nickelass now makes a living free in the Scablands with his mount Snakey-Poo the Wonderhorse, hunting squidrats for food and bounty.\nScratchbuilt model, photographed and altered digitally, one of a series with interlocking narratives. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcM1yF2Hjn9brCi4R4gq1kkBjzoe2uJ3aqdcPJVDrVM3c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcM1yF2Hjn9brCi4R4gq1kkBjzoe2uJ3aqdcPJVDrVM3c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcM1yF2Hjn9brCi4R4gq1kkBjzoe2uJ3aqdcPJVDrVM3c", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SmgSukHrJR9JsqiMUibLXgsNCAFeXAehM"], "tags": ["collectible", "olcrowcrew", "pirate"], "extra": {}}
