This postage stamp was created to celebrate the success of the Europeans in finding a route to the eastern world (the center of spices). Then the route was called the Spice Route, the route that brought the Europeans to their peak. This postage stamp has its own uniqueness. These postal stamps became controversial and were banned by several countries because these postal stamps were considered to bring back dark memories of the atrocities of colonialism.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPNkc6c7GB4EqHP5wrta3kqR3N9C5b7ht9jWtB594RCGh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPNkc6c7GB4EqHP5wrta3kqR3N9C5b7ht9jWtB594RCGh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPNkc6c7GB4EqHP5wrta3kqR3N9C5b7ht9jWtB594RCGh", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1a7rrLe6HKB71z6FJ8qiDkYkTjEMLd8UFN"], "tags": ["collage", "collectibe", "postagestamp", "gif"], "extra": {}}
