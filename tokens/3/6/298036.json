They have round, wedge-shaped heads with distinctive small tufts on the tips of ears and large almond-shaped eyes. The short, close-lying coat of an Abyssinian cat, has a distinctive 'ticked' look caused by bands of colour on each hair. The most well know colour is 'ruddy' but there are several others.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibcqdndusfyqocfl76wxvbfxvljghercepitb7kzh4jqgtfwqs37m", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibcqdndusfyqocfl76wxvbfxvljghercepitb7kzh4jqgtfwqs37m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreibcqdndusfyqocfl76wxvbfxvljghercepitb7kzh4jqgtfwqs37m", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["pixel", "pixelart", "cat", "pet", "animal", "objkt4objkt"], "extra": {}}
