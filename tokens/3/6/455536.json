In any case, there is no one here because they are all at home making NFTs & talking  on Twitter Spaces. She is so excited because this NFT art renaissance is even better than the European one which she had always dreamed of. This new golden age includes everyone from all over the world who owns a phone and excludes the business model of the  \u2018starving artist\u2019 which ruined many masterpieces.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeE5PPirPfX4VXXQTnwkvfsyBNkjXYBBdLPQzsqpL5RLw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQjteZxNtxvexekZ1uz2CF6PSzobog1AWrszZwjjtjMYc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeE5PPirPfX4VXXQTnwkvfsyBNkjXYBBdLPQzsqpL5RLw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QG5d7iZ6pW32mw5HsHCHB1Ao6u3xZ6mEV"], "tags": ["hawacat", "cats", "collectiblecats", "cat", "collectibles", "cafedeflor", "goodprice", "paris", "france", "nfteve", "evehennessa", "cute", "kittens", "kitty", "kittens", "collectibles", "contemporaryartist", "wellknownartist", "washington", "dcartist", "cute", "fun", "cafes", "artistslife", "nft", "collectiblenfts", ""], "extra": {}}
