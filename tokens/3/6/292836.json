A series of interactive internet art in form made by and based on web technologies.\n\nYou can interact with this work by moving the mouse and also scrolling each bar. In case of no interaction after 2000ms the work goes into demo mode; showcasing random patterns of scrollbars. \n \nIn this collection, I try to experiment with the most primitive and fundamental elements of web pages(HTML elements) as well as the possibilities that browsers give us in our daily life.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4h2c3PQcRZKDmrGq6Uk1ARL3wdm3BVHy98FXME4q3oV", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme6ZeGJ6CkyCk24bTp6UzoAYMp5v2TPj8fJbdJB6YNmCq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmY973rfaob9p4RVrW2ZPmbSmLeagdsDJsLdXdJfPCgfZP", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd4h2c3PQcRZKDmrGq6Uk1ARL3wdm3BVHy98FXME4q3oV", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz2C3BcgVsaWAkp3PHZjjubBvo9hysKjqqRS"], "tags": ["generative", "webart", "internetart", "web_primitives"], "extra": {}}
