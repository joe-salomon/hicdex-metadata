We thought it was funny. Now, of course, she's much older (almost 2 and a half), so she just calls them monsters, now, which is not as funny. However, because I've made an immutable NFT of her linguistic anomaly, the fact that someone used that sound in that way will now be preserved as long as there is a blockchain and a method for reading it...and electricity. ---Richard F.
