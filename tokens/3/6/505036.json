Pulse rolled oats in a food processor to make oats a bit smaller & transfer to bowl.\n\n2. Then add dates to food processor & pulse until a dough ball is formed & dates are smooth. ***NOTE ~ ensure your food processor is high powered; I\u2019ve broken a few food processors that weren\u2019t strong enough to cut through the texture of the sticky dates.\n\n3. Add dates & remaining ingredients to oats and mix until well combined either in a standing mixer or by hand.\n\n4. Line a cupcake pan with plastic wrap & fill with mixture.\n\n\nInstructions for Frosting: \n\n1. Blend all ingredients together in food processor until ultra smooth >3 min, adding a bit of extra almond milk if necessary if the mixture isn't cooperating ;)\n\n2. DIY decorative frosting bag - put frosting in a ziplock (really any plastic bag will do).\n\n3. Squeeze frosting into a corner. \n\n4. Cut the very tip of the corner off - how big you make this hole will dictate how big the line will be when decorating your cupcake.\n\n\n\nBlog post 9/16/2018 ~> https://lemuria9.wixsite.com/website-1/post/how-to-delete-this-post\n\n\nIG posts 8/30/2018\n\nFrosting ~> https://www.instagram.com/p/BnHt8ExgPMh/\n\nHow to apply frosting ~> https://www.instagram.com/p/BnHxaPXgj3q/\n\nFinal product ~> https://www.instagram.com/p/BnHxqkCg3Mp/\n\n\n\n11/3/2021 Moon 1 deg Scorpio, Sun 11 deg Scorpio\n\n\u00a9 2021 Recipe NFTs Inc. \nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nwww.recipeNFTs.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZtzC1kNv9PLYhfn5JpGm1mTNviSJGuh1zVsjjpKM1xUJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbXRuyWmk8zt8N63bte8FDqe8wZdpYj3xkbLjZLmXAb7B", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZtzC1kNv9PLYhfn5JpGm1mTNviSJGuh1zVsjjpKM1xUJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hU3XG444nNcSLZyoPwC6LeVndYnMYZML6"], "tags": ["recipes", "recipenfts", "henrecipes", "hen500K", "vegan", "rawrecipes", "akala", ""], "extra": {}}
