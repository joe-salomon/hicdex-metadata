Especially when he\u2019s excited and has a wicked sparkle in his eye, so I know he\u2019s thinking fun dirty old man thoughts, which are the best kind. \ud83d\ude08\n\n \n\nTogether, Harry and I have discovered that I love shibari and spankings and that, if you spank my bum enough, I fall asleep! Having suffered from insomnia my whole life, this was quite the discovery! More than that, I trust Harry so much that I have no trouble falling asleep in his arms, curled up into his side without spanks, which he tells me his Daddy heart really loves, so it fills both of our buckets! This is miraculous in that it had never been possible with another man before in my whole life, even the one I was married to for almost 20 years!\n\n \n\nHarry scrambled my demisexual brains pretty much from day one, and quickly coaxed me out of the bipolar, anxious, agoraphobic hole I\u2019d been living in for many years, really decades if I\u2019m being honest. I used to sit in my house every day, being anxious and depressed and afraid to leave because I didn\u2019t know what to do or how to be. Now we share dreams and goals and do things together like go on long drives where I\u2019m wearing a short skirt and no underbums, where we\u2019ll get baked snacks, and take a walk to eat them on a beach or by a river, then take photos together. Something like this would have been unthinkable previously but in 3 months, Harry has brought me back from Pleasantville black & white, to Sunny 2.0 in 1080p, and I am forever grateful. \u2600\ufe0f\ud83c\udf3b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83e\udd70\n\n \n\nFind yourself a man who thinks your daddy issues are hot instead of something that needs to be fixed. I highly recommend it! \ud83d\ude0a\u270c\ufe0f\n\n \n\n\u2014-\n\n \n\n## ABOUT THE PIECE:\n\n\u201cDream Daddy\u201d is a self-portrait of the artist laying on a large, old man dick, which is in front of a large, white moon, surrounded by stars, squirting silver glitter jizz. The piece features the artist\u2019s distinguishing abdominal scars and necklace, and the phrase \u201cDream Daddy\u201d. It was created on an iPad in summer 2021 for the Dickspo Collection on Hic Et Nunc, curated by Toppy Eton.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQLfRtwbDUwSYSTUfubKzxPPiEBnTTgH4NKoZHtNNEkYb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQD9LpdrwWzzL6NKaAdQktdHT6jbS1ZYv9mT4RTbfvqRu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQLfRtwbDUwSYSTUfubKzxPPiEBnTTgH4NKoZHtNNEkYb", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["KT1N5Pu98uFmRgtniMK8avHTd9xnNwoUejxV"], "tags": ["Dickspo", "SunnyCrittenden", "DreamDaddy", "DD/lg", "kink"], "extra": {}}
