He is gazing upwards toward the sky (and the Universe) and is seemingly unaware that he is about to skip off a precipice into the unknown. Over his shoulder rests a modest knapsack containing everything he needs \u2013 which isn\u2019t much (let\u2019s say he\u2019s a minimalist). The white rose in his left hand represents his purity and innocence. And at his feet is a small white dog, representing loyalty and protection, that encourages him to charge forward and learn the lessons he came to learn. The mountains behind the Fool symbolise the challenges yet to come. They are forever present, but the Fool doesn\u2019t care about them right now; he\u2019s more focused on starting his expedition.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQEKwnyA8XTjavYwZxYdrf9CyQ9nA9MKSQhyfL2jxdeXK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3hFXhhWouWmEgeGpYga1tHbwAYgesJ64KHTpXRy2BCD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQEKwnyA8XTjavYwZxYdrf9CyQ9nA9MKSQhyfL2jxdeXK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DYBQ4W4MPsQcDPSDAGaBE7N9UE2dv7Ukg"], "tags": ["Tarotcard", "card", "thefool", "art"], "extra": {}}
