They showcase key parts of Macintosh interface design choices, in just 1734 pixels.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs introduced Macintosh, he gave it a personality, and made  it say hello to the audience in a live demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tQ5XwvjPmA\n\nLater on during the introduction event, Apple showed an ad with a big 'hello.' hand-written in MacPaint.\n\nIt was a clever way to express, in a single image, both the advanced graphical capabilities and the approachable and even friendly interface of Macintosh.\n\nThis image of the cursive hello was so strong that it would be refined (as told by Susan Kare, who designed it https://kareprints.com/products/hello-on-blue) and used in brochures, in the press ads and in TV ads.\n\nHere's an example of the hello used in an Apple brochure: https://i.imgur.com/OCeiHG5.jpeg (from this gallery https://imgur.com/gallery/SjYELF8) and in the main TV ad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At-VgT-Kn-E\n\nOf course it would be a few years before a complete Apple advertising campaign could be created on a Macintosh.  MacPaint was imagined as a powerful demo and learning tool first, but not as a professional tool yet, even if Susan Kare started using it for some internal documents: https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=MacPaint_Gallery.txt\n\nStill, this use of MacPaint to create a powerful communication image was the first step in Apple becoming the dominant computer company for the the communication industry\u2014thanks to applications like Photoshop and Quark Xpress. And indeed today a vast number of ads are done from start to finish on Apple computers.\n\nThe microdesktop series is inspired by the black and white interface of the first Macintosh in 1984 and its small 512 \u00d7 342 pixels, black and white (no greys), 9\" screen.\nDesigner and artists had to use every pixels and find ways around the limitations, leading to beautiful 1-bit icons, backgrounds and illustrations.\n\nWhy this series? Our computer interfaces today are the descendants of the early graphical user interface designs, and have inherited many of the original choices.\n\nThe original resolution of this piece is 51 \u00d7 34 pixels only, 10 times smaller than the original Macintosh desktop. The final image file is scaled up 8 times, to be visible on modern computers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUAJFrfpEGwTnjyHnQmpUPxxB37uRQqYc4DPpb3fUpVg3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUAJFrfpEGwTnjyHnQmpUPxxB37uRQqYc4DPpb3fUpVg3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUAJFrfpEGwTnjyHnQmpUPxxB37uRQqYc4DPpb3fUpVg3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VhN58tCJbboQQoyTgLWoCwDUXBidfcAgd"], "tags": ["microdesktop", "computer", "blackandwhite", "history", "1bit", "icons", "80s", "pixelart", "macintosh", "b&w", "lowres", "interface", "1984", "pixel", "interface", "GUI", "mac", "brutalist", "hello", ""], "extra": {}}
