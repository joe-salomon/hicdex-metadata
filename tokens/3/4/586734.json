The analogue creatures were later transformed into the digital world and could be experienced with an Oculus headset.\n\nTaikus account for the recollections of the fictional character Valdiminia Borraveiros\u2019 time in a blown away for ever land, to vindicate the legacy of traveller and adventurer women, like Flora Tristan in Peregrinations of a Pariah, cradle and inspiration for the Neo-Victorian Surrealist style which impregnated the whole VR experience and installation.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbYr8Rhw8Jfzp4CoU98YToU4KFbbqtRjWG7y2m9sm1SF2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQeZoUXtYDVoGfa47SnNTTjChPEk4PZMsH5cAgdubCjzd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbYr8Rhw8Jfzp4CoU98YToU4KFbbqtRjWG7y2m9sm1SF2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hYBZGymM52REtwaDfb9Cy3GzzZbsyY7si"], "tags": ["digital", "virtuallandscape", "forest", "winter", "snow", "creatures", "magical", "centaur", "soundscape", "virtualworld"], "extra": {}}
