The intention is for the code to assist with the generation of interesting isometric output that can be interpreted as 3D shapes as well as 2D abstract compositions. For example, without context of other frames some of the still frames in this work can only be interpreted as abstract compositions, while others are more easily seen as recognisable 3D shapes.\n\nOriginal artwork by Herman Pretorius, 2021\n\nMade with JavaScript (no dependencies).\n\nSeries homepage: https://www.sizeight.com/know-your-abcs/\n\nHot keys\n========\nSPACE / Left click = Pause\nP = Toggle size (Browser size / Print size, 2048 \u00d7 2048 px)\nR = Refresh color palette\nW = Speed up\nZ = Slow down", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPgxm79MRLwMoWdg7rcHCADmr1GhESW7UXanjGyXazYZr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYPbKnG989pJLtp4hhxSkoTuRqFoUFCkDPpLojY8xTk56", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPgxm79MRLwMoWdg7rcHCADmr1GhESW7UXanjGyXazYZr", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1cxYoXMbdu443mMtKqMutsZESq7H78eMvA"], "tags": ["sculpture", "animation", "3d", "abstract", "javascript"], "extra": {}}
