I have nothing to give to you as a gift, but I can give you an order 6 word square to inspire you to turn the page. Word squares get WAY more complex the longer words get. On this one you'll notice the word SEICHT and might say, hey that's not a real word Andrew. You're correct...it's not in English, but in German its a real word and it means: shallow. Other languages are absolutely valid forms of spelling. I don't discriminate based on origin of language; language is language. I usually prefer English, as it is my 1st, but I'll use any language if it works within the confines and concept of the artwork.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcLRB4nRRyP3Yi2q6jVqkKsa5RhM1rLSiCaLDS8fqUwyw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT2ZjpLGs2YEHqMLHnRmqSTA2U2zRaeH2oR23nVxpjRQT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcLRB4nRRyP3Yi2q6jVqkKsa5RhM1rLSiCaLDS8fqUwyw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
