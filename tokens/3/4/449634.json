The whole \"old meets new\" vibe of it all inspired me to paint a watercolor painting to commemorate the moment from my perspective. As fate would have it, my painting would inspire me to create my first ever NFT. \n\nI scanned the original 9in x 12in watercolor painting onto my computer and managed to dusted off my photoshop cobwebs to create this animated painting. \n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as i enjoyed creating it!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWiUjWVChNTcdttNn6r4FUAK79ZqRGRa8mCmPJuBq9Ysf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbMFKKpNAtMMFgw1cfksFmXLpK1sqmembUYKYBHEsZiNp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWiUjWVChNTcdttNn6r4FUAK79ZqRGRa8mCmPJuBq9Ysf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FVz6wsw5ZCwzN4vj5kD7fVS1KRkVTV2Lj"], "tags": ["CharlesLeclerc", "Ferarri", "375f1", "formula1", "f1", "silverstone", "motorsports"], "extra": {}}
