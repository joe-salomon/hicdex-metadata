It is the bone that gives firmness and stature. Without bones the head cannot rest on top of the spine, nor hands move, nor feet stand. Such that without rectitude, neither talent nor learning can make the human frame into a samurai.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUGGdUb2JjXQCFSfzNxJnQ2onGfVtquVaTZjxdNLrCEug", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUGGdUb2JjXQCFSfzNxJnQ2onGfVtquVaTZjxdNLrCEug", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXMeeMSC9h7YvRc1vxmkGezSBTPcG2pojgEuP4hoNCmfM", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUGGdUb2JjXQCFSfzNxJnQ2onGfVtquVaTZjxdNLrCEug", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iBMsrwVPsQ3aKRjBbdH22ium6enB9P7i8"], "tags": ["procedural", "bushido", "abstract", "japanese"], "extra": {}}
