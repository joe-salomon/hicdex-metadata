The solution for clean water & soil in Florida is currently illegal, tied up in bureaucracy, and stuck in partisan political agendas. \n\nGrowing hemp, moringa, and even bamboo would help supply nutrition for humans and a better ecosystem for more vegetation for the diversity of animals like manatees.\u00a0\u00a0Why are these crops not mainstream in Florida for the common small garden? Why is the most rich land in Florida used to make sugar instead of healthy fruits and greens? Come on man... the bees are dying and Florida's beekeeper community can not keep up with the domestic migration rates of people moving into Florida; am I the only one concerned??\n\nUnfortunately, the so-called-leadership in charge of health, nature, and education in Florida are occupied with divisive agendas in 2022 while the wellness of our community is suffering. \n\nTrade this video NFT to help raise awareness and to help grow a SmartFlorida.org\n\n____________________________________\nWelcome to Web3 \n\n@ReUpCafe Metaverse\nShow & Tell Podcast\n\u202ahttps://anchor.fm/reupcafe\n\n#NFTgallery \nwww.ReUp.cafe \n\n#ReferralCodes\nEarth2.io  4JILI7W38J\ncoinbase.com/join/horbow_w \n____________________________________\n\nEconomic Renaissance  \nWeb3 Innovation Revolution\n\n@BigBenEnergy\nUS Veteran Logistician \nCommunity Building Game Designer \nClearwater Cyberforce Crypto Citadel Class1\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 SmartFlorida.org \nLinkedin.com/company/SmartFloridaOrg\n\n\ud83e\udd85", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcvs8V29z2E4RrSwBZ4wAd7ngri1TWKdMX4TAy296onLM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbYDjSr8TMhTw4vxmQZMyHLozrR2P6drjDWTYPvy85diP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcvs8V29z2E4RrSwBZ4wAd7ngri1TWKdMX4TAy296onLM", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1ZMdEx1Fb7H9Khyp94ibYTNycGCbCtWQzJ"], "tags": ["Smart", "Florida", "FLA", "Flaco", "EDU", "Economic", "Renaissance", "Innovation", "Revolution", "Clearwater", "Crypto", "Cyberforce", "Citadel", "Horbowy", "Game", "design", "art", "Commerce", "Community", "collectible", ""], "extra": {}}
