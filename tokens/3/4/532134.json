{"__version": 1, "token_id": 532134, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Menari diperapian | Meta Visual Poetry series [3]", "description": "This poem is the embodiment when a human soul is at its lowest point.  all thoughts enter causing confusion that makes us lose control.  Emptiness, depression, anxiety, are factors that lead to hopelessness for the life that is being lived.  all meaningless actions, all expectations poisoned with inferiority.  This poem is written in Indonesian.  To make it easier for you, I provide a translation in English.  maybe this English does not cover the whole meaning (because of the difference in meaning equivalent), but hopefully the essence of this poem is conveyed.\n\nDancing In the Fireplace\n\n3. \nAnxiety overtakes this whole body\nWhen your fingers no longer dance between my body\nWhy u give anxiety on the veranda if it is silence\nDoes silence actually guarantee letters that were never addressed? \n\nLike it or not \nGrief over this loss will settle into a wound\nIt will also cause the arteries throughout the body to stretch\nWhen grief hurts feelings\nAnd the twilight came as the closing of the old days\nEnding a life lived with regret and disappointment;\nThe day of vengeance has come.\n\n-arifansdr- 2017.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbGq9L4R8qM3P1MBXdZttd44buR11VAHzNN2o6AXLah1c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSUreARMWs8kU3mTjxPQxjerbS6bPfgMirtUSQk1zgxd9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbGq9L4R8qM3P1MBXdZttd44buR11VAHzNN2o6AXLah1c", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28f36EsUqgfUBVUvBq5KsmSWRqdrfD8mnC"], "tags": ["Menaridiperapian", "arifansdr", "poetry", "poem", "photography", "blacknwhite"], "extra": {}}
