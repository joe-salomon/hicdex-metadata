They are ignored and rejected.\nThey are the people who work in acres and not in hours.\nThe hands that feed and hearts that share.\nWe thank you.\n\nArtwork dedicated to the unheard voices of farmers and people who work to feed us.\n-aham\n\n1536\u00d72048\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTvbHGXaWo4QFxeaTZbarhkuRQ6UfFSMGT1VJ6Gf3MdWi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmccCABvZHR5JTVZNp7UFpbpXanGyWDiLgAu7Y7bbkc3yF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTvbHGXaWo4QFxeaTZbarhkuRQ6UfFSMGT1VJ6Gf3MdWi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2MsPvLKFjitWQFbvKdCKjyJCzfPS6nfGNK"], "tags": ["Digital", "painting", "artwork", "rare", "illustration", "fineart", "people", "culture", "colours", "details"], "extra": {}}
