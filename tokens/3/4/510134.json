This is a series of 100 NFTs over 100 days, all broken screens, all 1/1!  I don\u2019t know if this will be successful, but I\u2019m inspired by the idea of working on art daily in order to build momentum.  I have shelves of broken screens I have collected, so this will be a way to force myself to photograph them.\n\nTo provide context for the images, I will occasionally post ancillary photos of the broken devices involved on Twitter @rdklinc.  I will mint on a daily basis and at a random time.  I generally avoid apps and effects, using only minor color correction, and I often put my own photography behind the broken screens to bring out the colors.  \n\nThanks for looking!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYAZuMSTXyxtiFEJX5xzcgrPBSGdG1j85NFbaSzyYJvbg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXMkWZnYwnEts2ecmQC4eFnsTm3abWsir8gToonnhpQWF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYAZuMSTXyxtiFEJX5xzcgrPBSGdG1j85NFbaSzyYJvbg", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Pm55U5NxqFaoMe3CSJHFkqYzRUkhyyQcL"], "tags": ["abstract", "glitch", "bsotd", "photography", "abstractart", "bsotd005", "rdklinc", "brokenscreen", "glitchart", "brokenscreenoftheday"], "extra": {}}
