That is, He created him.\n\nAllah is Al-Mubdi, the originator of all creation. He is the beginner of all things and nothing could have existed without his willing it to be. He is The One who initiates all things.\n\nSay, \u201cAre there of your \u2018partners\u2019 any who begins creation and then repeats it?\u201d Say, \u201d Allah begins creation and then repeats it, so how are you deluded?\u201d (Quran 10:34)\n\nIs He [not best] who begins creation and then repeats it and who provides for you from the heaven and earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Say, \u201cProduce your proof, if you should be truthful.\u201d (Quran 27:64)\n\nHave they not considered how Allah begins creation and then repeats it? Indeed that, for Allah, is easy. (Quran 29:19)\n\nIndeed, it is He who originates [creation] and repeats. (Quran 85:13)\n\nAnd they say, \u201cWhen we are bones and crumbled particles, will we [truly] be resurrected as a new creation?\u201d  Say, \u201cBe you stones or iron (Quran 17:49)\n\nAllah begins creation; then He will repeat it; then to Him you will be returned.
