{"__version": 1, "token_id": 389934, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "VERT I GO", "description": "Years ago I had a severe case of vertigo (the sensation of dizziness) that lasted an entire week. I couldn't move at all. I was paralyzed by the dizziness. There was and still no cure for this condition as it suspected of being an inner ear virus. I had to lay flat on my back, with my head facing straight up. Even moving my eyes in the slightest bit, would send me spiralling out of control, resulting in extreme nausea and subsequent vomiting; a horrendous ordeal that I would never wish on my worst enemy, ever. This work plays with the concept of nostalgia and wordplay to visually recreate the sense of lack of depth perception. Reminiscing on that experience made me think of the word vertigo. I was able to break it down based on the syllables. From the word vertigo, we get VERT I GO. So not only does the background repeat and fade towards the center, but we are being stretched vertically by the words VERT I GO. These very words themselves define which way we are going through this dizzying effect. We lose all scale of reality and become lost in the madness of dizziness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaCgBsMkNWKBx3cK3571pz4dVfur6qWawVuAs6my645hW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPNbwdHtu4Ub3CdD4yZgdqQE3miSrUZHfb71JTyKFot9S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaCgBsMkNWKBx3cK3571pz4dVfur6qWawVuAs6my645hW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
