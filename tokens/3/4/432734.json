This is my first amateur video completely edited on TikTok and shot with a iPhone 12 Pro Max.The first half of the video was shot on Rarity Mountain in Tennessee on I-75. The second half was shot in Atlanta on my way home to Florida.I speak about me finding my first cousin dead in my mothers basement when I was 18 and how I still have dreams about the experience to this day. I also talk about my daughter dying from heart failure in 2013 and how it effected my life.The lyrics in this song are %100 real. This is a testimony of the pain I\u2019ve felt in my life but only covers a small portion of the whole story.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUSTBvHQBSBW6NwQnVsTZwgNUANr7Sd5L7mtTJvwYYXhz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdS9NbiSsUio4xfUb5CYGzN2koVy1fYAJX9ioQPCkZTYK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUSTBvHQBSBW6NwQnVsTZwgNUANr7Sd5L7mtTJvwYYXhz", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1bUfChMASwxgJnKk33JHMuFJjfHtCNT1xG"], "tags": ["DyrtK-DubbTrellePain"], "extra": {}}
