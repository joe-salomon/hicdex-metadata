But, after being home for almost 2 years due to COVID-19 with my family, the stay was much harder than I thought. To tell you a little bit, I had some issues I had to manage that caused a lot of stress. And that no wonder set the mood for me. There was laughing and talking noises everyday at home, but then suddenly it was only me. I saw my family walking around everywhere all the time, but then there was only me half-sitting in bed with a lamp on. I would say I was normally independent and alright by myself, homesick was never a thing for me. But, for some reason, I was so lonely and scared to be alone at that time. All I was thinking at was I wanted to go back home, even that was only the first day of the stay. I missed home, I missed my family.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRh8YBzRJpccd9KK6ypjtBtKYa17RfPHAYNRpfYh9pjGF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfAWjouMwPzktDdaYaP5YFrg239VLVHs1suXTk2p9kFM5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRh8YBzRJpccd9KK6ypjtBtKYa17RfPHAYNRpfYh9pjGF", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gfSPNWJp8YtTCxntnhwHVKrF6XmkxkfMz"], "tags": ["mixedmedia", "watercolour", "abstract", "ink"], "extra": {}}
