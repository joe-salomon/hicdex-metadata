Yates (Holy Fool)", "description": "[Paint pen and mixed media collage on found cardboard with digital embellishments and color.] Maizy is a sun creature, and she's feeling a bit depressed this year. She spent the summer coughing and sputtering because of the forest fires, never truly getting to SHINE, and now that the rains have come back to the Pacific Northwest, it's also the season when the sun sets earlier and earlier each night. (Good for us evil, NIGHT PEOPLE, but not ideal for sun folk...) Poor Maizy. Better luck next year! ---Richard F.
