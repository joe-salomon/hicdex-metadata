There's a specific scene that I always love watching and ruminating on. It's from Season 6: Episode 15 'Miles to Go'. Rose learns that her boyfriend Miles is really Nicholas Carbone, a mob witness relocated to Miami by the Witness Protection Program. She was discussing with the girls about how much she's going to miss Miles because he has to be relocated. Rose says: I don't know what's real anymore. When I think of the things I've told Miles, the things he's told me. The things we've told each other. Things we've said in a restaurant. Things we've said on our way to a restaurant. Things we've said on the way home... And Dorothy quickly quips: The two of you shared! We get it! In this singular moment, we can see how the fragile ego of Dorothy who is desperate for love herself lashes out at na\u00efve Rose's statement. When I watched and re-watched this scene, it became clear to me the best way to encapsulate the moment would be to take this line from Dorothy and make a metaphorical razorblade out of it. Her words, though funny to the audience as a comedic satire, in reality and in that moment could be viewed as very damaging and dismissive. The phrase, 'hurt people, hurt people' comes to mind.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWCGn1UzpQ48rc76thhud6hxQJxnuT8RyrCS48yA3seuw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbJGbczxaLynGbLAwycPZch5qpNmSpuo4zmsTDgmJ33PP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWCGn1UzpQ48rc76thhud6hxQJxnuT8RyrCS48yA3seuw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
