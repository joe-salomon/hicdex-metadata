This is all experimental and might break in the future. OBJKT uses p5js with p5.createloop and post5.\n- @TeNinEightNFTs", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeMyaXvsCdFfxzakHESxagqQVXGYdngh7m6VSE6wnDB3e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQxpKb3mmRtgiD4sN92dkUKBdr1GJHEWvXA5JTuQHNxK5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeMyaXvsCdFfxzakHESxagqQVXGYdngh7m6VSE6wnDB3e", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1WwLpnjMbjfQEmUpExC8wqNuZP5vTjYqgS"], "tags": ["hendependent", "individual", "bars", "ownerbound", "realtime", "hicdex", "interactive", "generative", "p5js", "procedural", "tenineight", "api", "noise", "kaleidoscope", "kaleido"], "extra": {}}
