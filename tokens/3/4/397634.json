It represents a discussion between the states of Bahia and Esp\u00edrito Santo, who debate over which place actually invented the dish.\nThe setting, which is very sentimental for me, represents a typical farm in the state of Minas Gerais, where I was born. I materialize here memories of my family's farmhouse, in the village where my father was born and raised, where I could grow up outdoors, listening to ghost stories, building tree houses, jumping fences, having contact with the land and running away from the big city chaos during the weekends.\nThe wood stove is a symbol of Minas Gerais culture and many of us still have one at home. Unfortunately, with the current government, it has ceased to be just a special option for making foods with Mineiro's flavors. For many Brazilians , it's now the only option as they are not financially stable enough to afford the gas canisters.\n-Ana", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfRxMp9XagTke4zv2NdMMz4PshRUNkTmRJMf4oLkEAWsJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSnTSXjUDcTfG6y92Eu7SUkG2b5EiXqcyaMXMWhmnuTuR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfRxMp9XagTke4zv2NdMMz4PshRUNkTmRJMf4oLkEAWsJ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1TqZ2MLEuGCNTHc73HuiWsMan8Qyek3cqp"], "tags": ["illustration", "animation", "brasil", "colorful", "food", "music", "song"], "extra": {}}
