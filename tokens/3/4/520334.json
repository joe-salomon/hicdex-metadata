They are often kept in tiny pastures on tiny farms surrounding the forest. Pop one in your backpack when hiking so you can wrap your lips around those luscious udders when thirsty. If you squeeze them (gently now!), you'll enjoy refreshing M\u016bnkin milk. When done, just toss them onto the trail! They'll find their own way back home! What clever little devils!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPYYhXNGGs4wSVDEhxDV8TucAQUpvbDjsAoCHXbESMiDG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVGjqDThGyYUNT6v469jm6U8ejjRs8VtfxKLbPT2Cb6Qd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPYYhXNGGs4wSVDEhxDV8TucAQUpvbDjsAoCHXbESMiDG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NzLxSjdrFHn6HZvU92wAAvtgqjy3JzauW"], "tags": ["milk", "cow", "udders", "M\u016bnkin", "johnlearns2art"], "extra": {}}
