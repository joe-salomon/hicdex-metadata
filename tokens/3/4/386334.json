You might find her in New York looking cool, or you might find her in Singapore doing business we know nothing about. At times, she likes to hang out in Tokyo, Japan restaurants and analyze her katana up close. This girl is a total mystery, she looks bright and intriguing, however, one is not likely to get to know much of her directly, she is a lone wolf, and is on this earth for a purpose she is preparing for, maybe that is why she owns the katana? Perhaps a spiritual warrior and business savvy woman.
