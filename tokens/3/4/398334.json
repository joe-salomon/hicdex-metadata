'Is it alive?' \n'It can talk,' said Haigha, solemnly. \nThe Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said 'Talk, child.' \nAlice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: \n'Do you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! I never saw one alive before!' \n'Well, now that we HAVE seen each other,' said the Unicorn, \n'if you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you. Is that a bargain?' \n'Yes, if you like,' said Alice. \nFrom Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll 1871 \n\n.................................................................................... \n\nHand cut collage.
