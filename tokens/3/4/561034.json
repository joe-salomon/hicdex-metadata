Faith can also cause great harm for those who choose their faith over science or choose their faith over modern medicine.\n\nWhen there is a public health crisis, the responsibility lies within the community, on each and every individual to protect the whole community from that threat. Faith will not protect you from sickness. Faith will not prevent you from dying. A global pandemic is not god's will. Science can help mitigate the spread and modern medicine can help prevent people from suffering and dying. There is always room for faith, but faith is not a defence. Faith is not a cure.\n\nMulti-layered collage by @dehiscenceart, 2021.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT9oHDsZ3k6i9UJTiUJKGTYMBiyBPBgL6xKq6yEJqx6AV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSrVCsJKexN9QCE4roMfTToEjhAnLh888eQEMpxcHrYjf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT9oHDsZ3k6i9UJTiUJKGTYMBiyBPBgL6xKq6yEJqx6AV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtZmtxhiWc8Nv6AtC1YjVCtJoFjv4nTqL"], "tags": ["collageart", "collage", "faith", "delusion", "medicine", "pandemic", "darkart", "digitalcollage"], "extra": {}}
