But he is obedient and seems attached to me willing to do whatever I command and I can take advantage of him.\"\n\n\"And I met Chadeernay one night outside Liquid nightclub, not much to look at but she knows her way around an antler if you know what I mean. Now we have this kid that she claims is mine so I have to keep her here or she will get the courts involved\u2026 I pay enough as it is. She smokes my stash and eats my food but at least I can plough her every night.\"\n\nNoideer is a cute little deer but Dash never takes care of him the way a father should. He\u2019s a bad father and spends his days doing bad things or teaching Noideer to do bad things like smoking weed or stealing underwear etc. But to Noideer he is a hero that can do no wrong, even though he is a real piece of shit.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdFyBGjFMf88HHgZccASsRyVL18zRnD48W2XZmav9uLro", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPo9ayuoHbCnAPVyGxtZPPU2d9zEaaWhiursFqpfb1yQ5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdFyBGjFMf88HHgZccASsRyVL18zRnD48W2XZmav9uLro", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Uics9r7n7Z5jKUNv91Tru4hTWx4ZdMMer"], "tags": ["Drawing", "Cartoon", "Postcard", "Deer", "alcohol", "drunker", "drug", "NFTartist", "loser", "illustration", "Thaiartist", "green"], "extra": {}}
