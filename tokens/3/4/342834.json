Unfortunately, the glacier is a dying giant. Due to global climate change, the Pasterze is presently receding at over 10m per year and has lost over half of it's volume since it was first measured in the 19th century. As things presently stand, it is increasingly likely that vistas such as this one will only be visible to future generations through photographs.\n\nBlack and white photography.
