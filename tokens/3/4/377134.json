Opening up the thinking can lead to looser thoughts, expansive and free which can lead to ideas or solutions to the situation.\n     \nThere\u2019s a shift in your thinking occurring, it\u2019s releasing from the constraints and tightness of what it was before and becoming looser, freer, more open, clear and expanded.\n\nHave you ever just gotten so tied up in knots thinking about a situation you\u2019re in, whatever it is or whomever its with? Getting tied up in knots leads you to be stuck, there\u2019s no way out, maybe it even feels difficult to breathe. When you are physically tied up this is exactly what \nhappens, struggling and fighting will tighten the knots. \n\nHow are knots opened? By loosening them. How can you loosen a knot? By first being loose. Be fluid like water.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUhwLBd5q2i4L44gKbUSeJ6SazTf5SjWCrjkEcaLM4565", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQNWoSPZvFyCTBavAoXNhA9ziaXdaJvmh55Au3h44J8qC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUhwLBd5q2i4L44gKbUSeJ6SazTf5SjWCrjkEcaLM4565", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
