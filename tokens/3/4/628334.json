This problem causes conflict in the relationship between humans and tigers, which leads to a high mortality rate and the near extinction of this animal.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS8QStLHyHhkQTrdGb1AKpPvrnd6V9ahB7zuj9nxzNDJP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdnGpMAJ8GYbKxpdFisyJqkFPkowJzjK4k4epY3rmyVk2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS8QStLHyHhkQTrdGb1AKpPvrnd6V9ahB7zuj9nxzNDJP", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1anUaAD4sbiyCBHkKBVwUEmwYJPrdQFXZW"], "tags": ["#WongTuo#savetigers#sumatratiger#tiger#harimau#harimausumatra#art#pointilism#rimba#konfik#sumatra#animal"], "extra": {}}
