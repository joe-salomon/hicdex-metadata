I try to explore gestures to represent the loneliness, isolation, limitations, and suffering that I have experienced so far.  through philosophical reflection, I conclude that life is useless, because everything that happens in the world is just a repetition of what has happened in the past.  In this photo I also represent the current authority of the human body.  Whose body is this when humans are contaminated with industrialism like now?  are they still theirs or just a commodity that has to adapt over time?\n\nthis Photo is one of three photos for this personal project.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZxh1ayvPKZbA6o8wTcw3LU7VeTKZAkL8xWga2WwHLZs2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ3sYgWYwuejFRrevXWNRZaR58F84Gg2BahW8VF3HcDYu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZxh1ayvPKZbA6o8wTcw3LU7VeTKZAkL8xWga2WwHLZs2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28f36EsUqgfUBVUvBq5KsmSWRqdrfD8mnC"], "tags": ["Blacknwhite", "photography", "surealism"], "extra": {}}
