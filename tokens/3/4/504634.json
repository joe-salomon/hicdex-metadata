The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: At my old apartment on Madison Street, where I\u2019d stayed to play video games with friends. I\u2019m still high on PCP. My teeth are crushed, but I can chew them. My front doorbell rings. It\u2019s the landlord. \u201cIs it you?\u201d I ask. \u201cMy dog\u2019s here,\u201d he says. My mother is in the next room. \u201cShe\u2019s OK,\u201d I say, smiling. I\u2019m aware that here, in my old apartment, I\u2019m repeating the mistake I\u2019d made earlier that night in a basement bedroom, when I hadn\u2019t pulled the covers back to reveal my wounds. I want to lie down, to fall back asleep.\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 186 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY73M9kGBGHw3aQxji8H62jBwWCteaAasZnQ5TYNAUp8h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcKxui7iULbt7upyBWFPdTCQfziVBX6U1bVix3c8PGipA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY73M9kGBGHw3aQxji8H62jBwWCteaAasZnQ5TYNAUp8h", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
