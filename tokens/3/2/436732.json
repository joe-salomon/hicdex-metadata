I typically\ngenerate thousands of attempts with many different seed texts, after\nwhich I manually work with the best of them to complete the artistic\nvision.\n\nThank you for taking the time to enjoy my art.  It's delightfully fun\nand rewarding both to make and to get better at making, I hope you\nlike it too.\n\nThis series is my first on Tezos, and consists of a limited run of 16\nartworks, released starting October 15, 2021.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTEiA3QRZgbZPRJyYivEjttX2i8Q1RVR6RNbQqdBaSXtS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZPKNzxMWtEqMx4PqigEBjSfcR2PFQWXJYv3F2EDPqcJa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTEiA3QRZgbZPRJyYivEjttX2i8Q1RVR6RNbQqdBaSXtS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XFcuRkFJ6FPvRvMdf8Xi6tMvFP6qnCprp"], "tags": ["artificialintelligence", "aiart", "ai", "art", "bee", "insect"], "extra": {}}
