Viva La Vida, means Long Live Life, the last word from Frida Khalo, one of my most favorite artist. She wrote it on her old canvas while she was writing on her note that she wanted to end her pain every single day. It is very ironic. I suddenly felt the part of her and made this up. This is the piece I love the most.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSCB53BQLqeUBNd8ttYxnGPxQCWWENuYQ5ifEALoFvk2s", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma42K9Pku1MMgxJRW12JVSifAEgFrxa3odDkgtviGte1J", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSCB53BQLqeUBNd8ttYxnGPxQCWWENuYQ5ifEALoFvk2s", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1N2zRmpmKF1r2SJYKtvSoWoCSv7ogPHMm1"], "tags": ["digitalart", "painting", "illustration", "digitalpainting", "art", "personal"], "extra": {}}
