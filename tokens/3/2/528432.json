{"__version": 1, "token_id": 528432, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SuperNova", "description": "A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object, called the progenitor, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or is completely destroyed. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months.\n\nCreated with Studio Artist using some of my macro photgraphy experiments with different substances, added a bit of a digital twist to bring a bit of visualization into it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaey74TPfMwJunE3ihz2SdjAfxCpJwbAr2vmG4nG1J7vy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfLoDjunKdAbahni3FfKSjJPr1ZAPaFKmDxAS2BjsqBV7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaey74TPfMwJunE3ihz2SdjAfxCpJwbAr2vmG4nG1J7vy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NnGL1vBYtpgwWg83PbpAdA9esS7tLKMiG"], "tags": ["supernova", "stars", "explosion", "glitch", "strobe", "animation", "digitalart", "universe", "bigbang", "existence"], "extra": {}}
