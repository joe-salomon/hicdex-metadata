It also works great on overcast days or just after it has rained when the light is lovely and soft. These were flowers in the rock garden on my farm after a thunderstorm. I am always fascinated by the shallow depth of field that I can play with flowers like these.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSCEF5ZNEE7b86Ro1Titwmg5dhvLhGo6q8LnAk6aNBsEa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaFq24u9xdmNfXhxR9i6M3r29SCVdsKrAcsU1WuUhh39G", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSCEF5ZNEE7b86Ro1Titwmg5dhvLhGo6q8LnAk6aNBsEa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dT1cPF73Cc51o9pu9CCMiyz9AbmT71Fgs"], "tags": ["macro", "flowers", "SouthAfrica", "Barberton"], "extra": {}}
