Young dragons spend the first few years of their lives living in trees until they become too heavy to climb. \n\nIn 2009 a research study used a medical scanner to confirm that komodo dragons actually have venom glands in their lower jaws. \n\nPhotographed at Denver Zoo\nNikon D5300", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQNg5cLjbpdyGZSshV9m7QDokDLvXK4A7p3Aba9vaDoet", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQSNeWqToYPEHcaqs1cmzhAMB63qQ7DWibEiFgriYFRdr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQNg5cLjbpdyGZSshV9m7QDokDLvXK4A7p3Aba9vaDoet", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1a2KS4XmaoGXd26UKVsfxjZ889yKmLUAz9"], "tags": ["photography", "art", "dragon", "komododragon", "lizard", "reptile", "zoo", "denverzoo", "nature", "animals", "wildlife"], "extra": {}}
