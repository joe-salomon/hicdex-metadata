{"__version": 1, "token_id": 495432, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Naked-Backed Fruit Bat", "description": "The Philippine naked-backed fruit bat is one of the species of mega-bat that are endemic to the country.  An adult naked-backed fruit bat will measure anywhere from 218 mm to 221 mm in length, from the tip of its notes to its tail. They usually weigh from 125 to 143 grams. The connection of the wings to their back's midline gives it a furless appearance.These are large bats found in the caves of Negros Island in the Philippines. They are listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, and a small population is reported to have been sighted on the island of Cebu as well.\n\nIn Philippine mythology, Philippine flying foxes (fruit bats) are linked with many of the eerie spirits that haunt their nights. This aswang (Filipino for vampire-like creatures) is a woman by day, but at night her torso detaches in the middle. The upper half grows bat wings allowing her to fly through the night in search of her preferred source of nourishment: the unborn fetus.\n\nSource: https://owlcation.com/stem/The-Top-Ten-Critically-Endangered-Animals-in-the-Philippines\n\nhttps://news.cornellcollege.edu/2017/10/halloween-superstitions-and-flying-foxes/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPgK4YBtUJFHS8BA7auL1r3K4nJbW7gfJnA49ooXSZM1v", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmap88JyTYzDagaMA1VgmKXfyF8A7rFj2sgmTAfpqrKdN8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPgK4YBtUJFHS8BA7auL1r3K4nJbW7gfJnA49ooXSZM1v", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZzWbwteKmwRiwE3YNMa2JufN4q1wEUUdh"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "psychedelicart", "astral", "folklore", "animalart"], "extra": {}}
