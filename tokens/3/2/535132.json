An ever evolving space for one to comprehend the present time and its embodiment in many forms. \n\nTHE LIMINAL SPACE was one of the piece I created when a friend explored the way of experiencing pleasure. \n\nI began with wanting to visualise my interpretation of in-between-ness (liminal space) with ink drawing yet something about monochromatic photographs came across after having quite some-time to use camera and explore layers digitally. Then I decided to use photography as the medium.\n\nFor a moment during the process I chose the body of one of the closest people i knew to bring vulnerability to the front lens while extending it with the way his body interpreted and got used to physical and non-physical pleasure by himself.\n\nWe found out that liminal state of pleasure was something that quite took a toll on how he perceived and i perceived his presence and physical body. A subtle yet  evolving state of interpreting and embodying pleasure using body as medium which later captured in cold objectivity of lens.
