I tried to name this artwork \"The Sea Dwellers\", it's like \"The Mother Earth\" but for the ocean. If we save the ocean, we save humans.\nA healthy ocean regulates climate and reduces climate change impacts. Human activities are threatening the health of the world's oceans. Marine pollution comes from land-based activities. Marine life is facing constant threats and dangers and is slowly dying.\n\n\nWe can't change the past, but we can make our future better for all humankind.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRkjZiZeWxESn4JPbXnh97M2XsGaTZVUqcdCNWjCkHjR7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRvGi5fdBr3yddpbS85yGbPFcZrAC7keX7skVrSuQ2D11", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRkjZiZeWxESn4JPbXnh97M2XsGaTZVUqcdCNWjCkHjR7", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1L3xJ8BsAtkjMVHPZjjSGNUy8aKVBQTCk9"], "tags": ["sea", "life", "humankinds", "human", "ocean", "seadwellers", "illustration", "heyapriliaa", ""], "extra": {}}
