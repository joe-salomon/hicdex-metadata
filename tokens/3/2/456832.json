Her little son survives, who would have fed on the milk that still flowed from her breasts.\n\nThis unusual event moved the inhabitants of the area, expanding its history and creating a cult, where she became the keeper of the roads.\n\nDevotees turn to her when they will embark on a big or dangerous trip, or even when they want to buy a new vehicle\n\nIts animitas (small sanctuaries on the side of the roads) have been characterized, over time, by the accumulation of bottles of water that devotees leave as an offering for the thirsty saint.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7eJqrjn6ay1FVts9ZvP1GxUNfFhYZPdnqNh1QWLrC84", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmchNExfE8JV1R3bVjJh8pusqomRE8tVR45vb4DzoC5UXS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf7eJqrjn6ay1FVts9ZvP1GxUNfFhYZPdnqNh1QWLrC84", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Msw4zFwvgJWn7ubfybTb1irSeuHQXo9Zi"], "tags": ["difuntacorrea", "myth", "saint", "argentina"], "extra": {}}
