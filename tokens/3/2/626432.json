Black Frame Frame", "description": "Feeling isolated from everyone she knew, Rayna began to despise everyone who lived a happy life and opened her heart to the devil. Deep down she longed for purpose, but all she could feel was pain and misery. Lucifer himself noticed her lack of sense and rage towards everyone around her, and offered her an opportunity: \u201cI\u2019ll give your life purpose if you help me take everyone down.\u201d\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied. Black frames are initially given out for free on Hicetnunc. All artworks will be compatible within the Gallery Gehenna Mobile Game with each artwork unlocking a playable segment.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdp5xvxHNmtLW2gYKzVoi8ZjR9RBuu4Xz84hdk5JRtgRi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXXocwcU4viF3ouhdKnBGE4EAXALk3RcmURLbMGExYb1o", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdp5xvxHNmtLW2gYKzVoi8ZjR9RBuu4Xz84hdk5JRtgRi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["GalleryGehennaProject", "GalleryGehenna", "GehennaProject", "Demon", "DemonKid", "NeuralNetwork", "NeuralNetworkArt", "Hell", "Darkart", "Creepyart", "demongirl", "girl", "utility", "game", ""], "extra": {}}
