What I love about algorithmic art is that I can revisit what I've done and combine it with other works to create something quite different with it. In this case, I took my earlier work where I explored how to create effective looking eyes for algorithmic animals. My initial version of the fractal triangle was simply a series of coloured dots getting smaller and smaller. When combined, it becomes a series of disembodied eyes staring out from the darkness. \n\nCreated in 2012.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXyo5KPpqvjZszkX6H7bwa2RPPk9aoWsDP2ZPp1WpLF4k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVGhreanBSFdp7Q3Thj5ZqMnXYvG8DHYNMdHjNfpEw32u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmdaBsvMPuV8BcjQQvih5kYtd8sVkXg3bc1rygcPdL74NR", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXyo5KPpqvjZszkX6H7bwa2RPPk9aoWsDP2ZPp1WpLF4k", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Zg2bm2EdgdCDcekhX7hE9VU5CfFzcXaqM"], "tags": ["contextfreeart", "algorithmic", "lunarbunnies", "generative"], "extra": {}}
