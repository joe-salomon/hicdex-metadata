Some movements pause for a brief moment to let you admire the intricate machinery, others keep going uninterrupted.\n\nThe Strange Movements series builds on the earlier t-SNE series [1] but adds the element of movement. Also, the rendering algorithm has been modified to produce somewhat different shapes.\n\nSources:\n\n[1] https://clauswilke.com/art/project/t-sne\n\nAuthor:\n\nClaus O.
