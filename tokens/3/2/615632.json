Each Dual Painting consists of a diptych that relates an emblematic painting from the history of art with its associated colored graph. This graph connects areas of similar colors to each other. The work establishes a duality between the infinite, continuous, analog space of color, and the finitude of networks in the digital world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVemP4nxwBMc6oJsT8Z6nNz1MTnbcutMqez53aXiA5mEW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZHqiy7jLCkRGNGyWVRUpQvHasiNpBntPy4sVWuvvXvJa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVemP4nxwBMc6oJsT8Z6nNz1MTnbcutMqez53aXiA5mEW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PajQPa3aN8u4rRRQYbQCXFDidZkBKwje5"], "tags": ["arthistory", "giotto", "network", "digital"], "extra": {}}
