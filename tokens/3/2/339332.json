A cherub, passing through the badlands, from the deepest jungle to the farthest mountain, slaying every monster in his path.\n\nSome may call him a hero, his fury, reckless acts of heroism but nobody really seems to know the reason behind why The Outlaw does what he does.\n\nMaybe one day, we will learn of the origin of this trail of blood. But until then, he remains a mysterious hunter, roaming a world of monsters.\"\n\n\n\nBuy his unique PORTRAIT today!\nThank you for supporting young and upcoming artists :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd3dPVTucUpxJJrq94DKwpBoDqtfQCR2oJYEvLhGg94hh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWwpEJpQqHd5sytATKrP1EsXJmCvpXjYu26fvScSe4HrX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd3dPVTucUpxJJrq94DKwpBoDqtfQCR2oJYEvLhGg94hh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bRYF9zNPJ1m6M5rAUjCwL6yNtP2gz4c7F"], "tags": ["art", "photography", "illustration", "digital", "2D", "3D", "painting", "evol", "revol", "gevol", "001", "outlaw", "limited", "highlylimited", "hen", "objkt4objkt", "cheap", "character", "horror", "action", "sword", "snow", "cowboyhat", "demoneye", "orange", "yellow", "mysterious", "10", "camera", "sony", "blur", "motion", "series", "EVOL", "KidEight", "newartist", "artist", "youngartist", "horror", "hen", "eth", "competition", "c4d", "photoshop", "worldbuilding", "beginning", "number1"], "extra": {}}
