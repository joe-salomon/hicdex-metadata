These attributes have been expressed in subtle and pronounced radii of curvature through which each culture has represented its idiosyncrasy and maximum of aesthetic values. Aphrodite, Aka, Arianrhod, Bast, Brigit, Freya,  Haumea,  Mastor-Avaz, Tlaltecuhtli, VENUS.The Goddesses of fertility represent symbols of love, beauty, eroticism, sensuality/cruelty, and femininity, all characteristic aspects of the Maternal Archetype. The Venus_D\u00b4CODED is a modern representation/adaptation of those canons of sensuality and fertility to which tribute was paid in primitive times during the development of culture and humanity, giving way to a modern re-interpretation of the cult of femininity. This collection offers a series of pieces generated through algorithms inspired by the feminine curves of nature. The resulting set of iterations that comprise the series are inspired by the evolutionary and inherited principles of genetics.
