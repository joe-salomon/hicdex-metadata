Please Stand By, A Nurse Won\u2019t Be With You Shortly. With ICU\u2019s at max capacity across states with high COVID numbers, and burnout setting in after long difficult shifts, hospitals can\u2019t fill nursing positions fast enough. Additionally as states like New York look to impose vaccination mandates for all health care professionals, hospitals are facing mass firings for all nurses who spurn vaccinations. In New York alone tens of thousands of people are estimated to not have gotten a shot despite being threatened with losing their jobs. This has led to a nationwide shortage of possibly the most important job in the country right now, and with no immediate solution to the problem there does not seem to be an end in sight. So next time you are checked into a hospital  don\u2019t be surprised if your attending nurse is nowhere to be found.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR8taZQ5PoUT1xWhYnBWUYCwSqaLJSNXEbVudLbiNjuZW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmThvzupHqUPyYNNKuCW4qvUiS5xfTwYgnPyJrgjstB8xA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR8taZQ5PoUT1xWhYnBWUYCwSqaLJSNXEbVudLbiNjuZW", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
