{"__version": 1, "token_id": 581032, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MALL LINES", "description": "Syntax crystals are sometimes the most beautiful when split in the middle or begin to show a fracture (a space between the words). In the case of, MALL LINES, we can begin to see this fracturing between the words MALL and LINES. It's a subtle aspect, but it reminds me of diamonds that have inclusions within them, which reminds me of \"The King's Diamond\" of \"Scratched Diamond: story that I heard when I was a child. (It's an old adage about looking at something flawed and realizing it actually is still beautiful in a different way.) Seeing the flaws within the syntax crystal reinforces and even emphasizes it's uniqueness. You could associate a narrative to this crystal or not. Just because you COULD do something, doesn't necessarily mean you have to. One thing I notice after I made this was that I could have extended the crystal; one more time with SMALL LINES. I suppose I could do an alternate version in the future; might be interesting.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT8FpYN3AZNW1ft24xzJvN7S7ex7aUJqGwaGUAMsBnips", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVc6zXXbGs2fioNYGtRod3R5TSn4NVsXS5nTHXu663o2s", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT8FpYN3AZNW1ft24xzJvN7S7ex7aUJqGwaGUAMsBnips", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
