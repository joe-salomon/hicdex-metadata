It's called \"Leah's Daydream Drawing by Mouse\".\nYes, it was made fully with only Mouse and a Painter app. The result is messy but contains certain beauty. \n\nLeah is 7 year-old girl who wants to be everything. But she has to sit down for 9 hours a day and can only daydream.\n\nMore coming. Thanks for all supports.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaKfPoX2Z9Zo6Px6ecf5pCzHpBRQCSmwm2b8hR1Txx1Yg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaMoAWWhz34XW1xyndNSueyN8eSJ9gTvDHphkFd14tTxG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaKfPoX2Z9Zo6Px6ecf5pCzHpBRQCSmwm2b8hR1Txx1Yg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MdPsuoWSLVbwVBFiRQfPM2PsTLfXTTvw6"], "tags": ["leahsdaydream", "drawingbymouse", "emeraldieart", "popart"], "extra": {}}
