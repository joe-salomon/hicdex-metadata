{"__version": 1, "token_id": 392032, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Cackatoo", "description": "The endemic Philippine or Red-vented cockatoo is a small psittacine with a helmet crest and red undertail coverts. The white plumage is extremely conspicuous in flight and in the foliage of the lowland dipterocarp and mangrove forest habitats. It is 12.2 inches long and has an 8.6 inches wingspan. It also has the ability to mimic the human voice, which makes it a highly valued pet. This is why it is vulnerable to illegal wildlife trade.\n\n\nThe story of conserving the katala \u201cCackatoo\u201d  teaches people to persevere and not to lose hope. It also shows that people \u2013 regardless of the \"bad\" things they did \u2013 can still change for the common good. \n\nThe existence of  Cackatoo reminds us how healthy our forest is.\n\nSource: https://www.philippinecockatoo.org/philippine%20cockatoo.htm\nhttps://www.rappler.com/environment/conservation-philippine-cockatoo\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdkmYXj26xTEueFCrD1aFzk2BL9y1nzj5NoY2b3D54jDV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdkmYXj26xTEueFCrD1aFzk2BL9y1nzj5NoY2b3D54jDV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdkmYXj26xTEueFCrD1aFzk2BL9y1nzj5NoY2b3D54jDV", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZzWbwteKmwRiwE3YNMa2JufN4q1wEUUdh"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "psychedelicart", "astral", "folklore", "animalart"], "extra": {}}
