It had beautiful country paths to get lost in, geese running around, and a blacksmith\u2019s shop. At the general store, you could buy old fashioned candy sticks in hundreds of flavors. I would get lost just trying to choose one. My favorites were butterscotch and green apple. \n\nYou can get lost in this candy forest too: To see it in AR, view this page on your iphone/ipad and press the little 3D icon in the corner of the image. Please have patience as it takes a while for the colors to load.
