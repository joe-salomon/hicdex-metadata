{"__version": 1, "token_id": 505532, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sabda Raja Dosa Classick Bootleg Tape, Perina Edition ", "description": "Bootleg tapes were a staple of 70\u2019s -80\u2019s Indonesian music history. Back then, western music albums weren\u2019t officially licensed locally. So the only way you could listen to foreign albums were either by getting it straight from abroad (which is expensive), or buy the \u201cofficial\u201d bootleg version that was available at your friendly local cassette stores. Naturally, most people opted for the second option. My father had a HUGE collection of these bootleg tapes. Although I found out later that bootlegging is illegal, those tapes had a major influence on my musical experience. They introduced me to some of the classic albums that I love to this day. \n\n\u201cSabda Raja Dosa\u201d was the very first song I ever released. It was originally a part of Grimloc Records and Def Bloc Union joint compilation CD \u201cPre-Text For A Bumrush\u201d, and was later put out as a standalone single on my (now practically defunct) Soundcloud page.  \n\nThis is \u201cSabda Raja Dosa\u201d as if it was release by Perina.\n\n20 years before Aquarius became an Indonesian audio juggernaut in the 90\u2019s, they had Perina as a bootleg record label. One of the oldest label out there, they release all sorts of 70\u2019s music. From jazz to pop to latin to classic hippie artists. I don\u2019t think they were still very prolific by the time I grew up, as I only really seen them on my father\u2019s old time collection.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVqn6C3AkyzN9XyY64jQXZStFs7pXaRdSURSbFzBpDVCU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQNXUqjdotP6QYDEsJneC9Jd4nbn64NAp1QYDVgvqokzu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVqn6C3AkyzN9XyY64jQXZStFs7pXaRdSURSbFzBpDVCU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T9f1P4JAJ2sqh4QQMut65btmk6oMm3Jys"], "tags": ["70's", "krowbar", "80's", "perina", "sabdarajadosa", "tape", "bootleg", "indonesiancassettesera", "late90's", ""], "extra": {}}
