I need to drink coffee and stay away from the computer light for a while.\nI think: What the hell is what makes me think and overthink everything?\nWell, I just think that I don\u00b4t know.\nBut that makes me still keep in thinking,\nUF,\nI need coffee.\nAt that moment is when every day I see through my window to catch the glory of the sunset.\nI say to myself: I don\u00b4t know if today this sunset is different than yesterday or I\u00b4m thinking different tan tomorrow. \nI bring my camera to record the sky that I can see from my kitchen.\nWe are not shit, we are living and trying the best we can. I\u00b4m still believing on.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTSv3nHN5S8Kz7pabjcQDaoCkRhbdMK2Fp7muwijuPRV2", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf8eHLPw4TuEGSUv5MRVNQAXAXvtQhPsJneuJmWs69Fjv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZX1dJSLeE2F4Tby8Eogb6CwtbiK96Jnzev3Go4FqoEVj", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmTSv3nHN5S8Kz7pabjcQDaoCkRhbdMK2Fp7muwijuPRV2"}], "creators": ["tz1ichPK6qRDokxcguriiARTvsLkFzRvoXGp"], "tags": ["conceptual", "fotografia", "ventana", "window", "photography", "everydayifeeldifferent", "photo", "photez", "jp_colacioppo", "mywindow", "elviajedemisfotos"], "extra": {}}
