This man has promised to send postcards from every corner of the world wherever he goes, and even to send postcards from the end of the world.\nSome postcards will have many editions and some will be very scarce, but all together they will tell the life of this traveler, who has left his home in search of certain death, in a strange place, in a foreign bed, far from everything and his loneliness.\nPostcard #2: Lima, the capital of Peru, from where he will apparently take a flight to another country, to his destination. The dying traveler turns out to be a college professor and a very wealthy man. What else will he tell us in the third postcard?\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT6CBH8isNf7ekMVWKbVLqyn1twrBy9SPgmBVjvM9VUvu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZNpJSW4wc1C1PpVTzWMLuz4n6QUL28vLLznxF4ZffG8u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT6CBH8isNf7ekMVWKbVLqyn1twrBy9SPgmBVjvM9VUvu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Lp4f1RoBQGxWfyhH9hDfijm6PorKUpsfq"], "tags": ["Postcardsfromtheendoftheworld", "postcards", "letter", ""], "extra": {}}
