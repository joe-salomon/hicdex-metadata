It was Calixto himself who transcribed the King's delusions on that Night of the Frogs** when the Peppos*** first appeared.\n\nThere are those who fervently believe in Pepplogy. Others have the theory that it was all an invention of Calixto to hide the madness and delusions of his monarch friend.\n\nCalixto created potions and grew mint from his forehead. The latter ability had no correlation to his being a magician. It was just something he was able to do.\n\nThere is a terrible theory that it was Calixto himself who cursed the mirror in which Filomenus last reflected himself.\n \nAll Calixto\u2019s writings are contained in the \"Inefficient Book of All Non-Absolute Truths\". Many of his writings seem to be enigmas that have not yet been fully unraveled.\n\n*See OBJKT #439879\n**See OBJKT #245972\n***See OBJKT #307756\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdvPT6pGrdNvqWbCTnESYnecD1SaAG7KUzr3cRK22A6FU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTZ32HEkCgxX7miYtVK1AdSYbNroZ7qSkqRe3UMS8T8ye", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdvPT6pGrdNvqWbCTnESYnecD1SaAG7KUzr3cRK22A6FU", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Stamp", ""], "extra": {}}
