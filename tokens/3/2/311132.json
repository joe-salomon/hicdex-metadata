The spotlight gets smaller each con caught - an abstraction of time. The stereo clip clopping of the cons (Dr Abstract's tongue) helps the collector know which way the cons have fled! \n\nConGon, made with ZIM at https://zimjs.com, is a modern-day remake of the 2004 MotoGami Flash game by Inventor Dan Zen. This mini-series also included ChooFu, InfiZoom and KiteKilt.
