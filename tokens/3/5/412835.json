Perhaps it is that, or perhaps growing up to cartoons of Strawberry Shortcake, that has convinced me strawberries are the most adorable fruits.  Full of joy, that's for sure!  You cannot take strawberries seriously!  Betty Fvck was generous enough to let me doll her up, and I created this dress and headdress to adorn her in.  She is an amazing drag performer and model living in Helsinki.  Check out all her amazing artistry! \n\nModel and Makeup Instagram.com/BettyFvck\nHeaddress, Costume and Photography Bubbles And Frown", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf3isA4cMWb4C1tNhmR4VBJHnocFum1nmu1q7mEdWQQGr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSvfwPkVXkd39uCFoA7bZBzy7Jy4hqFnmjFqMxHTYa2Rx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf3isA4cMWb4C1tNhmR4VBJHnocFum1nmu1q7mEdWQQGr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ij4fDuptsj21qW1zqr3LDCERjbbC9rGcn"], "tags": ["drag", "dragqueen", "performanceartist", "strawberries", "queer", "lgbtq", "makeupartist", "costumedesign", "headdress", "headpiece", "pink", "woman", "model", "berlin", "a;ternative", "queerlesque", "bettyfvck", "cabaret", ""], "extra": {}}
