Or it could mean that the weaker one dies. Also, this verse is inscribed on the back of Hole's \"Retard Girl\" cover art. The lyrics narrate a girl being bullied on a school playground. In 2010, Courtney Love said she had written the song after a group of men tried to gang rape her while she was working at a bikini-bar in Los Angeles.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQUveCNSg386fhQ9qqUY9EBpdQfdhYcCxQZNdUWriKwop", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRgRJjzyPM3MHE7oBS5Gdjnzyb3F8SJjFd7WvYr5NN3x8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQUveCNSg386fhQ9qqUY9EBpdQfdhYcCxQZNdUWriKwop", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZY1jm5yN1xEDkRVPHWB2oNsfn6e6bT1KW"], "tags": ["illustration", "manualdrawing", "graphite", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
