They were investigating a suspected school shooter. That sound of horror in the detectiv\u00e9's voice when he asked for clarification \"Wait w\u00e9're meeting the suspect's friend, not him?\" -- \"10-4, we don't know where he is.\" by that time they had a mere 4 hours left to stop the school shooting that would occur that perfect weather beautiful day.\n   7:30am - the first calls to 911 where people couldn't do anything or give any information because how loud you have to talk for dispatch to understand you with their outdated equipment; no text line, just desperately hoping their phone picks up ANYTHING... 5 minutes later the first person was declared dead. Where is their increase in funding going if it's not going to upgrading their seriously and dangerously  outdated dispatch equipment? Considering they were spineless cowards that took 2.5 hours to stop this man take an educated guess.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY6SJLAA7ht3D7DDn99NRsruKJ1c64xDNStfY6E2vN6u4", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmak6Ztd2JDhn9XCazaBqN5JKsqsfMp7GvPB8SvECE6cyr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY6SJLAA7ht3D7DDn99NRsruKJ1c64xDNStfY6E2vN6u4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WSB79B4pMAqzsfhqox2FzCRkf15ybZ4GD"], "tags": ["AmericanCulture", "LifeInUs", "DailyFears", "TypicalDayInUSA", ""], "extra": {}}
