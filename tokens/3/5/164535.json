Why not take steps to better your life here on Earth and in turn better the world, one person at a time. Happiness and contentment lie within us all but to find it we must step away from those desires we crave so much.\n\nThe only thing we have control over in life is ourselves. We can control how we react to situations, people, and the environment. It is up to us to make a difference.\n\n5400px X 7200 px by @dehiscenceart 2021.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTJQPS1gXs3AWs5XupL1m3BC8W9oYLE1m7kNfpr7yqWTQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfH1D8Ln2agQbZ6XSxGmYwKWLp3cspsZZWbKdNWcAkUdt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTJQPS1gXs3AWs5XupL1m3BC8W9oYLE1m7kNfpr7yqWTQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtZmtxhiWc8Nv6AtC1YjVCtJoFjv4nTqL"], "tags": ["ARTIWTHAMESSAGE", "DYSTOPIA", "FAITH", "DARKART", "COLLAGE", "ILLUSTRATION", "DEEPDREAM", "SURREALISM", "CLEANNFTS", "LIFE", "DEATH"], "extra": {}}
