Unlike the exoticism of urbex, this series seeks to expose forgotten or ignored elements of our environment that are hidden in plain sight; to uncover the beauty in the mundane.\n \nThis series was born out of a desire to combat my depression, when even taking a walk seemed a Herculean undertaking. Passing through many of the same surroundings day after day I began to forge a connection with scenes and vignettes that were at first glance easy to pass over. In sharing these images, I hope to inspire a similar connection in others.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmckyEt65c4CCAyTASV9J1FGanmLW9RkFJhSAxWXSBLoaN", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma1NFjkzCP9Va5okkAna313MfugSJf6FgqCTif3CtDFah", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmckyEt65c4CCAyTASV9J1FGanmLW9RkFJhSAxWXSBLoaN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iabvFX2r61cz9wJ2NjUHyVVsyFYMB5kqN"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "serenity", "urban", "urbex", "urbandecay"], "extra": {}}
