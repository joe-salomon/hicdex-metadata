Ripple. Yes.\nPut the two of us in a boat on the gray river;\n\nkeep rowing in a circle while on the hazy banks\nclumps of grass swarm and echo the rhythm of words\nwe had once spoken: after this, mistake me for someone else.\nSleep no more. Wave. Wave. That's love enough.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYsj35MHcK54XcgF32wCd8mksrisgztmJngVf4WsnSQjy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUG1exsSfC3Y3EwTjwwkToc1HXtoM953k37XG4iJcXaY2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYsj35MHcK54XcgF32wCd8mksrisgztmJngVf4WsnSQjy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gVTGNFvWaXq14erS3qT8Qvmke5FjVB29Z"], "tags": ["illustration", "hicetnunc", "wave", "horse", ""], "extra": {}}
