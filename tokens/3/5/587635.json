Now, I never know how the tree is. At that time, father said while rubbing my head, \"This tree will grow together with you. You will be both big and useful for each other.\" \n\nA year after the seed was planted, I moved to a city quite far away, four hours away by car. Now, when I'm an adult, I never know about the tree. Is it true that the tree grows perfectly and bears much fruit? If so, is the fruit sweet and delicious? Should I see it?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTLwrbCfBZGu43di4hScR6VLbdsuG58Vt7T9tbtTd8soU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeNYAnhwdTnMLV9wjUC23qGSorqviNfJk6Mf1gfLoqTrk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTLwrbCfBZGu43di4hScR6VLbdsuG58Vt7T9tbtTd8soU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UbeyXgCJ2MCdn9p529oDGNDPk9Fr1BZtH"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "collage", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "agareds", "book", "tree"], "extra": {}}
