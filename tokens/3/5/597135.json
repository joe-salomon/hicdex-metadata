Never find much in the way back home, but only because you weren't looking. Take a deep breath and soak the feeling of being a broken mess. Things might look bad at first, but there's much that can be done with all the pieces. \n\nMaybe try to say something? Something worth saying? Maybe you can just try?

In either case, maybe it's not so bad if you can be a friend to the rock, and it be to you. \n\nError, I love thee, error. Everywhere, eternal, plaguing any and all systems.
