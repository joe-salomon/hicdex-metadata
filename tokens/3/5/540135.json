When a frog swallows food, it pulls its eyes down into the roof of its mouth. ... Eyes positioned atop the head give frogs a field of vision of almost 180 degrees. This peripheral vision helps them spot predators and prey.\n\nClose-up Macro photograph of Asian Common Toad\n\nCaptured on Nikon D3300 & 18-55mm kit lens reverse mounted. Focus and depth of field was controlled manually. The photo was shot handheld !", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbpbYvYRJRQhfVKiQUmZjeh2fVn2wqTebrfFnfQ6FJ3t8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYGTyzGMRbEsbphnQmjGz57oDkHXECqaS2EWnKjHHLAqY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbpbYvYRJRQhfVKiQUmZjeh2fVn2wqTebrfFnfQ6FJ3t8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2RoKwaAYxzCpg1myGSAfqLWcX1DuGuajoq"], "tags": ["photography", "macro", "frog", "macrophotography"], "extra": {}}
