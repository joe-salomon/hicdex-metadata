When I\u2019m depicting a public f\u0131gure there\nare specif\u0131c mottos which are tied to them. It is very important to use these mottos together\nwhit the images to marry icon and motto to from one as art.\n\nMy artwork draws upon satirical and ironic notions;sometimes \u0131t \u0131s a means of adress\u0131ng the\nego of the f\u0131gure \u0131n a contovers\u0131al manner. I often draw from western and eastern cultures and\nthe\u0131r respect\u0131ve \u0131cons and subsequent mottos.\n\nThe use of #ayna (Turk\u0131sh for mirror) is because when people look at my art, the images are\nreflecting their life through soc\u0131al commentary. These images are on the walls as a motto and\nas a life scene. Consequently, the impression of my art on people is to make them smile and\nto subvert ex\u0131st\u0131ng not\u0131ons of the \u0131con; to reflect on what \u0131s often unspoken.\n\n#ayna never lies", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeY7L3ucKhTsEYtyTUte8ScU79iuKVA44zcwPTS3RLas9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUqRF959uYfpTfaQzWkdsn3UbQrFUVXPT6i8JBQ8c5VUP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeY7L3ucKhTsEYtyTUte8ScU79iuKVA44zcwPTS3RLas9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1f2inUhsxZKZoZo9Nj8azzRQhfrFBETnBd"], "tags": ["ayna", "tar\u0131kakan", "yesilcam", "streetart", "streetphotography", "istanbul", "turkey", "kadik\u00f6y", "actor", "icon", "photez", "photo", "propaganda", "obey", "j\u00f6n", "jeune", "1970", "vintage"], "extra": {}}
