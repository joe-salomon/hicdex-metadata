This is a bug that happens from time to time when you mint on Hic & Nunc. To fix this bug, just swap some editions of your creation. That simple.\n\nSo as the title says: this is not a bug, it's my art. For the sake of iteration, I thought this would work well as a tribute to Piet Mondrian. If this token has been helpful to you, please consider reselling or transferring it so the information spreads out to as many people as possible.
