The sky is best before the sunrises, if there are clouds then the light reflects off them in many colours and the sea is dark in some areas. \n\nThe variety and beauty of the pre-sunrise morning is glorious and abundant.\n\nI love painting Sunrises in watercolors and using wood panels instead of paper has brought a whole new dimension to the paintings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWFJfFd46Ype8X6sw7AB8pTyCBCzEbFTfmAeTsu5i3XSW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbfx2oWebsziteeUbPbTkEtdWnq8cjpTpVvS2LjL9NWp1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWFJfFd46Ype8X6sw7AB8pTyCBCzEbFTfmAeTsu5i3XSW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["sunrise", "paintings", "art", "StephanieFuller", "Watercolors", "Seagulls"], "extra": {}}
