Weep with me is an invite to cry and be sad together with me. The photographs in this series were taken in a time where I was in a really bad place and emotional time in my life and I want to look at it as a reminder that I was strong enough to get through things and even managed to take a beautiful outlook on it. I want anyone that enjoys this series to see what I saw, the ugly and the beauty of the game of life. Weep with me is a love song, it's a heartfelt movie, it's a realism painting, it's a handwritten diary, it's a scream for help, it's getting over your ex, it's a cheap wine in a bad situation, it's a celebration of life, it's the fleeting moments in life, it's my life through my eyes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTsCLyWqoVvMdoFztr11qzHByJaWchqTvfaBj888fk6ke", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd85nPTubxkb5TZPQPrdsHiiaYApmLogb9gXfePzbaL8f", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTsCLyWqoVvMdoFztr11qzHByJaWchqTvfaBj888fk6ke", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2P3xMVDdPE1JhxZiytAHSX44AQPhu6Wjs6"], "tags": ["eerie", "dark", "tree", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
