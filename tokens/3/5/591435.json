Gen1 Project", "description": "The name Santa Claus evolved from St. Nicholas' Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas).  The origins of the modern-day Santa Claus can be traced back to this saint. In the 19th century, images of Saint Nicholas/Sinter Klaas became more prevalent in the United States, though depictions of the Christmas legend still varied. This Santa Claus comes from the 1880s. An 1888 book illustration from The Night Before Christmas, or a Visit from St. Nicholas, by Clement Clark Moore. The poem, originally published in 1822, contained several descriptions of Santa as we know him today.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc4X68yGabF5VVhQ8eyYo8yW99WmeTthYD6XVQbwTZAsi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdvMYFePW6ujWgk9dphPou86qx1WMguqoEAJuXX6dNumH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc4X68yGabF5VVhQ8eyYo8yW99WmeTthYD6XVQbwTZAsi", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1fjjR2YpKqDHdSnaq5dBwZjx7HQqVdqNZE"], "tags": ["santaclaus", "christmas", "snowglobe", "interactive", "javascript", "ai", "aigen1project"], "extra": {}}
