You might be asking yourself, how and why should I be looking at the word SEE?

See has 8 permutation possibilities SEED / SEEK / SEEL / SEEM / SEEN / SEEP / SEER / SEES. The way these permutations are presented in the image are in alphabetical order and the spacing has included all the letters that are not present and that do not constitute a real word like: SEEA / SEEB / SEEE / SEEF / SEEG, etc.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPfX615jV7of1W8f5wGHQ49EGrybhevvK1Vt6iLVbCzup", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZXqDbGWtXBePZKfekA9mQ1xfBNsKDsRAMu1BMk2QuQiv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPfX615jV7of1W8f5wGHQ49EGrybhevvK1Vt6iLVbCzup", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
