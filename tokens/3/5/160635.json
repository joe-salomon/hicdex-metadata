It should be easy to remove. She has been sleeping 16-20 hours a day since Copper left us. She's been pretty down, although this morning she was unusually excited as she recited her favorite poem while holding 2 aubergines cuz we all made it thru the exploit.  I don't know where she picked this saying up, but I've heard this all my life, although as far as H=N is concerned, I\u2019d be HERE regardless. \"Dear, Dear, Bread and Beer, If I had a million, I wouldn't be here\" ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdWwF2iSCA4XWkQDQnqpaDxne9ZycetAPRQ1HRUBEcqdv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT6ENXicm4uWG5wMstmGh4TBHJ4C6BpBYKBp6adxJ4SLn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdWwF2iSCA4XWkQDQnqpaDxne9ZycetAPRQ1HRUBEcqdv", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2M3yNKfjHH8y8whX6xTz9MKAPUsGP6wLoH"], "tags": ["NFTReality", "POETRY", "AUBJKT4AUBJKT", "NFTverite", "NFTdocuemntary", "NFTelevison"], "extra": {}}
