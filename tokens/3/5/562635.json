{"__version": 1, "token_id": 562635, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LOVE LIES TOTALLY. LOVELIES TO TALLY.", "description": "Here is another semantic spacing phrase. Both sentences have the same number of letters, have the same letters, and are the exact same length. All we are doing here is simply controlling the spacing. What starts off as LOVE LIES TOTALLY, becomes LOVELIES TO TALLY, just by shifting LIES over to the left and splitting TOTALLY into TO TALLY. The result create 2 completely different sentences. When we compare the two sentences together the narrative created sounds like a conversation between two people about love. The first sentence takes a somewhat jaded standpoint on love, by basically proclaiming that love is a false dream or a lie. The second sentence directly below the first sentence speaks to physically taking a count of beautiful things.
