{"__version": 1, "token_id": 321935, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CULT 45", "description": "This text is a play on the old Colt 45 malt liquor ads that ran for decades on American television airwaves that pretentiously claimed by drinking their beverage you will become cool, have friends, and get THE girl. Fast forward to the run up to the 2020 American election, and a certain percentage of the Republican party began to drink this delusional magical elixir, only this time, it's CULT 45. The payoff isn't the promise of being cool, it's the hot mess of blatant white privilege, unyielding misogyne, and of course who can ever forget the refusal to even acknowledge systemic racism. If that wasn't bad enough, these individuals acted as if they were in a cult of personality, rather than a political party concerned about \"conservatism\". Just like Jim Jones' cult from the '70s...they all drank the Kool-Aid, the only difference is that today's CULT 45 didn't physically die, they just died on the inside.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQEYM5atkVEEUiEuq6dCkFYz9o12wSxCWexYxTtpyz8f5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSxvf7xicjcKcYK5Tnkg2E4k5LxFgSoJGmnbCEYt9A49Q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQEYM5atkVEEUiEuq6dCkFYz9o12wSxCWexYxTtpyz8f5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
