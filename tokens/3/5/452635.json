I'm terrified, they want to hurt me, it's torture, I need help, I feel their hands on me. I close my eyes in the hope that they will disappear and I can have some peace in my life, some tranquillity, some happiness. I just want them to get out of here, I think I deserve it, I'm old and tired, but having killed them doesn't give them the right to disturb me, does it? \n\nMp4 1536x2304", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcYCySm49TBJQYmTs2RRWmbCLqMJThKS85AkmhVskpgru", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme5ASXK9uBSj514SNqqhcSGFFqzV9ztRtW8dCMAqNCag7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcYCySm49TBJQYmTs2RRWmbCLqMJThKS85AkmhVskpgru", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bGLZ314J6Sn8x6FPzy67KzscBrZ57Ma98"], "tags": ["art", "artist", "sculpture", "3d", "plasticine", "character", "characterdesign", "sculptor"], "extra": {}}
