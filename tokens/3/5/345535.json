I need only to hear the silence ring through the walls and glass again and again", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdsJp5y4bk3jX8CAzZHzeHNEykvE4ocaiYD1ZnnDHednr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUjqXML69Z6McbuwVuyYM5KXxdns7DXgPR6TeKLDdtq6c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdsJp5y4bk3jX8CAzZHzeHNEykvE4ocaiYD1ZnnDHednr", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bchTMEsYtQLZCaRc713M5feyfxzPD87TM"], "tags": ["vqgan", "neural", "animatedpainting", "expressionism"], "extra": {}}
