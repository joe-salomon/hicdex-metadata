{"__version": 1, "token_id": 467035, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "DEVIL LIVED", "description": "Another example of the mirrored words, this time with as a palindrome. Well, not a typical palindrome like say, mom, dad, noon, race car, etc. This is a hetero-palindrome, a word when spelled backwards spells a completely different word. In this case, DEVIL spelled backwards is LIVED. Now if we take these 2 words and mirror them in such a way it abstracts them and gives it an almost symbol like quality. I love how the \"L\"s create a rectangle or a hole-like structure, almost insinuating the entrance to hell.
