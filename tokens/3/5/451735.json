If I'm honest, you scare me, but at the moment I want your company. The danger queen lies here, the one who takes away fears. My blood has a story that I know you want to hear. One bite, and you'll damage me, but I will not die. You may turn me away but I will not leave, for this grave restores my courage when I'm in the dark. Let me visit her tomb\u2014the queen of Venoms. But do not end me. I know your kind nature. Do not banish me, cobras. Do not torture me, pythons, like I am some kind of walking madness. I am not your enemy, great anacondas. So for my dear serpentine bride, your elegance is bordering on death and beautiful danger. Your enchanting hiss threatens my nightmares, like antidote to my poison devils. Your kindness is ever as sweet as a kiss, though the world accuses you as one born of deceit. For everyone knows even the queen of Venoms can be poisoned. Allow me, my queen, snake whisperer, to fix your forgotten shrine. You do not symbolize death. You do not signify hurt. You were beauty, intensity, power.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTQHJ94cQoze3ZNQbdcbeEoePyH8nFe41T7ZFBGDAjDkp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTTogYq3HAyVrrbVFBFkUdsFZvrgxhMURWy4Fp1JjdfqT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTQHJ94cQoze3ZNQbdcbeEoePyH8nFe41T7ZFBGDAjDkp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rw2JoU2AK2TNdfhcd4h918CdTGSNh5Gnw"], "tags": ["literature", "spilledink"], "extra": {}}
