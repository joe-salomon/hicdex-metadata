But the sacredness of the Jaguar Spirit represents the journey of the sun across the sky and the darkness of night represented the infinite journey of human consciousness and its transformations. The midday sun\u2019s position was compared to the Eagle, flying high in the sky, to then plunge below the horizon, just as we plunge into the dark to face our spiritual challenges and to be transformed.
