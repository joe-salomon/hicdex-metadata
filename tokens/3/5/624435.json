Please Stand By, Democracy Is Under Attack. On Jan 6th 2021 a group of insurrections fueled by lies repeated by then President Trump attacked the capitol & threatened our democracy.\nDue to the fact that this attack has been attempted to be painted as a peaceful protest by the right I've added sounds from that day of the rioters to amplify the severity and realness of what happened. I've also included a link below of a short documentary produced by the NY Times that  I believe should be required viewing for all future High School Students, because if we don't learn from this fiasco it may just be the beginning of something much worse. Please I urge everyone to check it out.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007606996/capitol-riot-trump-supporters.html\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbJ2EkFGhSisYgMNgikG7knePXy8sgEG6J6SmPmnarMVK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUgto1ecsnLdaACgEQtmHdL2Tg57pZASeaHQ2ixSUVN8T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbJ2EkFGhSisYgMNgikG7knePXy8sgEG6J6SmPmnarMVK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television", "JAN6th", "Jan6", "Inssurection"], "extra": {}}
