Each Poster-comic presents a different and auto conclusive story, although at the same time these stories cross their paths and are connected to each other.\n\nHandmade drawing, digital color.\n2339x3307 pixels", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQWodcAFzWAne6YHU5rQ1TohAcVuH3Pcuq3BHYBYn27JM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdomELP9iEGRDNBkb6BTgfWBG957C2teYRoM3T5kDQncc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQWodcAFzWAne6YHU5rQ1TohAcVuH3Pcuq3BHYBYn27JM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cicJW6zjuqNTRjKMumwiPySsnhvyxAby3"], "tags": ["silenceofnobodies", "postercomics", "estudiokodixe", "comics", "story", "metaphysics", "jpg"], "extra": {}}
