The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: I\u2019m sitting on the toilet when a young NFL lineman comes in from a work event. When I ask him to stand, he grunts one negative word, and then grabs my right wrist, at which point I release his hand. The young man leaves, but not before telling me, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I watched his performance.\u201d The scene changes. I\u2019m at my desk, writing. A young woman, slim and beautiful, with \ncurly blond hair, and wearing a tight fitting knit dress, says she\u2019s my mother. She tells me I have the measles. I tell her I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. I tell her I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be bothered by a disease I\u2019ve already been sick with.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 42 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVwL2NFYNXZ5sK78GVVqrxWc2JTbLEJau1hsoLExsJbTj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWqjDHRgfAbzFnZQanTCbHnPLJWErBb3NDd7NGCzxBdPB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVwL2NFYNXZ5sK78GVVqrxWc2JTbLEJau1hsoLExsJbTj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
