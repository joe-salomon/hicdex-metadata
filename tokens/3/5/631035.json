The river is shown as a venerable old man stretched out on his side with a cornucopia of fruit in his left arm and ears of wheat in his right hand. Egypt is represented by the presence of a sphinx. The scene is enlivened by sixteen children who allude to the sixteen cubits of water by which the Nile rises for its annual flood. museivaticani.va\n\nThis bronze cast was made after a Roman marble statue in the Musei Vaticani, Rome and donated to the city of Copenhagen by the Albertina Foundation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdNLVjMxLc3AeHyLZyM4HevyrMrGKXyQjafMu5Gtn4E67", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZH6QGSWQxF5m1T2BGrgZXR7WpDkysLeqLKZzg4h5SXKQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdNLVjMxLc3AeHyLZyM4HevyrMrGKXyQjafMu5Gtn4E67", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MwbPYK7vbCUQ7ADdbvq8eYkiRBydxKzLk"], "tags": ["statue", "color", "render", "3d", "vfx", "cinema4d", "art", "light", "sunset", "3dart", "nft", "nfts", "nftcollector", "blender", ""], "extra": {}}
