{"__version": 1, "token_id": 619635, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The crisis of empathy", "description": "In the last few days, there is one thing that has disturbed my humanity in my heart which I suddenly want to express in this painting, is it true that some humans experience a gap in empathy, feeling indifferent and not caring about other people as well as the environment, this is a dangerous thing to do. in the future, from the small things we often see, a group of people rejoice at the suffering of others, and some people don't care about actions that destroy nature, maybe the impact will not be much for our generation, but if the nature of empathy is not instilled in the generation after us, will have a bad impact. This painting reflects the bad thing, the nature of not caring and indifferent to the surrounding conditions, depicted with shades, dark, dirty, damaged, and on the other hand there are those who enjoy and have fun with these conditions, as if they don't see it, they don't care and are reluctant to give help.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTJkNb4sRiQhSuAid3nZCoYNvub7sedRyPMzLkfr24mcm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPWiUWnrgewkDbfxFLkKejrGmeM7wjhAf1iWvzdKxjy3b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXkntyiWNJumTsEtLgvkSGxngUPKkutqEmqmQ7EUHnN9b", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTJkNb4sRiQhSuAid3nZCoYNvub7sedRyPMzLkfr24mcm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Y5qGaKQnLDkj1p5tLaxw755Gu3jGMHu9x"], "tags": ["crisis", "empathy", "human", "social", "natural", "disaster", "decay", "relationship", "sociology", "reality", "future", "care", "care", "dirty", "dark", "bad", "creepy"], "extra": {}}
