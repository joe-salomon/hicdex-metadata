A sketchbook is perfect for this purpose and, usually being a personal collection, allows the artist to freely experiment - to make mistakes, to learn, and grow.\nThis series is an ongoing, daily conversations with my brain.  The pieces in this collection may not all be in the same style, or even in the same medium.  Some will be finished pieces, some more open ended \"works in progress\", that may on occassion make their way back into the collection (adjusted and refined) on a later date.\n\nBut all will be\n- 30 minutes or less\n- dated and numbered, with the time spent\n- 365/365 at .5 $XTZ\n\n** Extras, for each piece, will be burned after 365 days.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbBay8REwWB7bKeHfxU9wMTxgUGhZrMj317qkLB6TjKJt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYBTwuvqTXxJzNjqQP2iNSx3aBjSUptPbUER8fNVGMTJK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbBay8REwWB7bKeHfxU9wMTxgUGhZrMj317qkLB6TjKJt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d8Q2nYgawkGaMb2RXispf1tsFDt9b9SUG"], "tags": ["sketchbook", "daily", "365"], "extra": {}}
