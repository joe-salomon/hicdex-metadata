{"__version": 1, "token_id": 564835, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Afternoon Lullaby", "description": "The music behind \u2018Afternoon Lullaby\u2019 features a generative sequencer which produces a multi-track melody within limits the producer creates (scale, note range, waveform, etc). A set of probabilities per note is then used to influence the likelihood of the note\u2019s presence within a given measure. Thus, the melody is ever-changing and continues to evolve as the song progresses. A portion of this output was also fed into a granular synthesizer, which allows the musician to sample a short passage and then move forward and backward in time within it, meandering within a second or two of audio to create a unique passage of greater length. The result is something never heard in the natural world.\n\nThe animation for this piece uses both sound detecting software and manually keyed animation to sync up with the music.\n\n1920x1080 ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWXfoTeMVNsEJqXeckWX4D8pm9eVD1aasRaWekxLi7vA4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRNgFk46xASkLcTx1TWDaRuxyb5ZFKBvim9SNTcEPWZCx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWXfoTeMVNsEJqXeckWX4D8pm9eVD1aasRaWekxLi7vA4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1a9myWKuwSSFjQh8Zv8x9CDscSGij8JToX"], "tags": ["music", "audiovisual", "soundreactive", "cinema4d", "collaboration"], "extra": {}}
