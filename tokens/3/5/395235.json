As Muslims, we believe in Allah in accordance with His beautiful names and attributes. Allah has revealed His names repeatedly in the Holy Quran primarily for us to understand who He is. Learning and memorizing the names of Allah will help us to identify the correct way to believe in Him. There is nothing more sacred and blessed than understanding the names of Allah and living by them. How do we expect to worship, love, fear and trust our Lord, The Almighty Allah, if we don\u2019t know who He is?\n\nProphet Muhammad (\ufdfa) said, \u201cAllah has ninety-nine names, i.e. one-hundred minus one, and whoever knows them will go to Paradise.\u201d\n(Sahih Bukhari 50:894)\n\nAbu Huraira reported Allah\u2019s Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying: There are ninety-nine names of Allah; he who commits them to memory would get into Paradise. Verily, Allah is Odd (He is one, and it is an odd number) and He loves odd number..\u201d\n(Sahih Muslim Book-48 Hadith-5)\n\nThis project was created so that we always remember and get to know Allah more. the development of an increasingly modern world and increasingly advanced technology. we should always remember Allah.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYWzLe4ucSc8tKxFovUuUupMM2m7Jy17NkBNLG1YN4VmA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRvcKXBJYNBPYdDQBGms8JmzMEGCAPJXKRMy3XfYCyVbM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYWzLe4ucSc8tKxFovUuUupMM2m7Jy17NkBNLG1YN4VmA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["allah", "moslem", "religion", "pfp", "1of1"], "extra": {}}
