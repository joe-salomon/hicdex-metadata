This part of desert is a bit colder because of the mountains that surrounds it, therefore you can see a lot of gardens and greens  unlike the other cities in desert.\nWhen you don't see a peak, you can find mountains like hills. They make look small, but like a chain they continue until you notice them.\nThey are as high as the others, they are just far away. Snow is a rare thing but when it comes, you first see it on mountains like hills.\n--- \n35mm black and white photography", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSk8EtMgrVzWBLthFkCNZsB2cACRRQ4DMrF5bvN8sGEzu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU3h9mAURPkbYe9KPCG8ZHLC7EZjSwjhFog3CLg6mt9mi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSk8EtMgrVzWBLthFkCNZsB2cACRRQ4DMrF5bvN8sGEzu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Analog", "Photo", "mountains", "nature", "Filmphotography", "Photography", "35mm", "BW", ""], "extra": {}}
