The glitched work, like the original, presents a dream-like quality that could be representative of an artist who, in their maturity, has reached enlightenment (Fini was 78 when she painted the piece), or an artist waiting at the doorway to death.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWLHhXRioMXsVFMCVGq7a1gkSEU8n7KwwxCmthQd8FW4X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPwZma56nmmMQQKC8xxKEGpAKrsSQ4QkFFsvw3DaWDbk9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWLHhXRioMXsVFMCVGq7a1gkSEU8n7KwwxCmthQd8FW4X", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1KuDTfViBWjpmfFC6M3vRPF4M1cKqbTw2b"], "tags": ["glitch", "pixels", "surrealism"], "extra": {}}
