The effects were achieved through long-exposure and other specific camera settings.\n\nThis is part of an 8-piece collection. Pieces 1-4 are collored and 5-8 are black & white. The buyer of Piece 04 gets 1 edition of Piece 08. Both pieces are very special to me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSt1QzUTWrSf7isD89f4SzNnx7oGTNgyqKdaCqJvejo4J", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmabMfzRijfwzi1nv3mmhqgvC3QkEUHWf8Zp6TyCr6szBU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSt1QzUTWrSf7isD89f4SzNnx7oGTNgyqKdaCqJvejo4J", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UJobrmLNkZbbmjEu8Cefg1yLMrjUtrPqX"], "tags": ["nftphotography", "long-exposure", "nature", "experimentalphotograph", "trees"], "extra": {}}
