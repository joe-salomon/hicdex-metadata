They include the electronic distribution of an uranium atom; the emission of alpha, beta and gamma radiation; the chemical formula of uranium fission; the decay chain that chaotically guides the fission of U-235; calculations for the energy of a single nucleous of uranium as stated by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, as well as of one kilogram of U-235; the californium (C-254) decay; and more. \n\nA representation in negative space of reactor No. 4 right after the explosion is also portrayed at the bottom of the central figure, which personifies the countless heros that risked their lives to help mitigate the deadly effects of radiation.\n \n6000 x 8000.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbPYyofhePTN4otJ2hdfau4LKxy3T1QVCgxdPdk2xXu3H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcLez6vfu3enjQT955WuRAYhGUVBo651tSktdbLZkuJtW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbPYyofhePTN4otJ2hdfau4LKxy3T1QVCgxdPdk2xXu3H", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1bDSNRruSUSu5cXMtN57N9ihTg2dPpzVTF"], "tags": ["chernobyl", "illustration", "digital", "2d", "science", "dark", "digitalpainting", "painting", "mask", "radioactive"], "extra": {}}
