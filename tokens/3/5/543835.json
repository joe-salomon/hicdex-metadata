{"__version": 1, "token_id": 543835, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Street Art", "description": "In my opinion Street Art is a work of art that makes the street as its gallery. No need the invitation or be in a certain circle to be able to enjoy it. Every time I see street art, I am always amazed by their form and process. Since many Street Art works are made illegally, some results are good and some of them are mediocre.  \n\nA tribute to Street Art. Because for me the street is a work of art itself.
