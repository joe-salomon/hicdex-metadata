Leibniz invented the system around 1679 but he published it in 1703.\n\nThe 0s and 1s in binary represent OFF or ON, respectively. In a transistor, an \u201c0\u201d represents no flow of electricity, and \u201c1\u201d represents electricity being allowed to flow. In this way, numbers are represented physically inside the computing device, permitting calculation.\n\n[14-08-\u200e20]\nCreating a background using 3D typography created with Stardust (superluminal.tv) in After Effects. Inspired by the 1997 movie Gattaca and then had another version with binary code.\n\n[17-08-20]\nPosting the OG gif on giphy\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/1-0-01-f74WQIhbzBKAusL2v1\n3,177,518 Views (on mint day) \n\n\n[18-09-20]\n4K 16:9 Video Background Pack available on Envato Videohive\nhttps://videohive.net/item/code-gataca-background/28241535\n\n[10-10-21]\nMinting this 1:1 | 800x800 | 360 FRAMES | 0.06 second per frame", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZYKfAyib48TWeh9J3QSfjQ7Dbj7W49t5NiATAMUqxCt7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZYKfAyib48TWeh9J3QSfjQ7Dbj7W49t5NiATAMUqxCt7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZYKfAyib48TWeh9J3QSfjQ7Dbj7W49t5NiATAMUqxCt7", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["blue", "loop", "0", "1", "computers", "animation", "future", "technology", "code", "data", "seamless", "binary", "Leibniz"], "extra": {}}
