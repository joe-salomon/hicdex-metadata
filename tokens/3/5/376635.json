Who is the silent witness?\n\nIt is That which understands that this moment of fear is just an emotion and it will pass the way the water ebbs and flows. The silent witness knows too that joy will come and go, and come again as the waves wash the shore. \n\nIn meditation sit and simply observe that which arises in you. Feel the sensations in your body and hear what you hear.  Feel the emotion and watch as it subsides. When we learn to simply be at peace in  silence with ourselves, to be aware of what\u2019s happening in our bodies and our mind this can spill over into our everyday lives. Every simple act can become a meditation. We learn to witness how we react to the world. By the very act of watching the observer \naffects the observed reality.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb6tw7HThW65V9v2Y1gDLWM6SwEFAV1tvXN5UG4nxsrX6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWMVGKfn7BNqEfTB8jUxfAhwD8VufF9pF3y5CiCfDdMwu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb6tw7HThW65V9v2Y1gDLWM6SwEFAV1tvXN5UG4nxsrX6", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
