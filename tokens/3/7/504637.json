The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: It\u2019s a beautiful day. In the distance I see my mother, who is standing in front of my bedroom window. She is looking at the trees in the immediate area, and says, \u201cClose by.  I\u2019m going to be home in ten minutes, I\u2019m going to see if I can find my things.\u201d I think, \u201cShe\u2019s telling me to find my things.\u201d I go into the house, looking for my things. When I return, there are few things, or no one at the door. I\u2019m angry. What gives?\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines.
