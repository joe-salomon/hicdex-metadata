An anadrome is a word that can be spelled backwards like a palindrome, but instead of being the same exact word, it spells something completely different. I chose the anadrome of STRESSED / DESSERTS as way to process the anxiety of a year and a half of social distancing and everything that we all go through on a daily basis to stay safe from COVID19. Everyone has their own coping mechanism for stress. Some people became workaholics, some became gym rats, some it was learning a new trade or skill and millions of other variations. My go to for being stressed is eating a dessert; something sweet to wash away the pain. So this anadrome is the perfect analogy for my cycle of anxiety. When I feel like I'm going backwards and getting STRESSED, I move forwards by eating DESSERTS; figuratively and literally.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVEZiHJUK87UBwQhRChAvuuvhMKBGc2avbDW2ezR1FVPH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeJao9Rq4ArotqRSDA8b5iFRdfMaC1BXfZXws6vrdpZh1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVEZiHJUK87UBwQhRChAvuuvhMKBGc2avbDW2ezR1FVPH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
