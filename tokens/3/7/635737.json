They swim slowly with nearly invisible movements of their fins, creating the illusion of seaweed floating in the current. \n\nClose relatives to seahorses, male seadragons are also responsible for childbearing and incubate the fertilized eggs.\n\nPhotographed at Minnesota Zoo\nFujiFilm FinePix HS20EXR\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRVmj6p8YqNssRcYjXbEfYdRMuzVoqo69eR46qKhAPZeS", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf8dk9LMr1cWhSvQLt357iQqeh36qk2ynUYxafpWeMe5P", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRVmj6p8YqNssRcYjXbEfYdRMuzVoqo69eR46qKhAPZeS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1a2KS4XmaoGXd26UKVsfxjZ889yKmLUAz9"], "tags": ["photography", "art", "dragon", "seadragon", "seahorse", "fish", "reef", "zoo", "minnesotazoo", "nature", "animals", "wildlife"], "extra": {}}
