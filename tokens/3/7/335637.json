The recording is simple, using an old brazilian Giannini Baguinho amplifier with a sm57 microphone.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNypkNcqLY6eEGGxjzcbxkzWw54ogFi8E9MWANqVZSFKQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdWNSHD1DuSdgzBgMJums7Hd4yQvFk6XSKbnwSaeQWNQN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNypkNcqLY6eEGGxjzcbxkzWw54ogFi8E9MWANqVZSFKQ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RsFrbkJync4shc9ZxfjG4DMLXBDRbLXt9"], "tags": ["noise", "experimental", "circuitbending", "soundnft", "videonft", "ruidomorto", "cryptoart"], "extra": {}}
