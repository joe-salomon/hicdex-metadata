Bystanders who were in the vicinity were trying to aid a cat who was swimming in his own pool of blood, with half of his face bashed in and barely able to utter a single word. Witnesses claim that the suspect of the assault was an orange male cat with a scar on the right side of his face and two earrings on his right ear. \n\nBut the residents of Saint Valencia had never seen an orange cat for so long since the Meltdown. Everyone was baffled. Everyone was confused.\n\nCould it be possible? Could it be possible that the orange cat they saw was the lost heir of House Silvis?\n\nCould it be the sweet and curious cat they were fond of?\n\nCould it be\u2026 Dobi the Firstborn?\n\nBut why hurt another individual? What are his motives? What is going on inside his mind?\n\nWhat happened to him?\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmej6x5T7m9UGYH79pjz4vZJWokbUJwfWzW1kv3q4cs7zd", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmej6x5T7m9UGYH79pjz4vZJWokbUJwfWzW1kv3q4cs7zd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmej6x5T7m9UGYH79pjz4vZJWokbUJwfWzW1kv3q4cs7zd", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YJXZGU9DQAzj6YyNByCZP7VHRseuj2FkX"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "illustration", "comics"], "extra": {}}
