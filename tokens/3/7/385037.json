It is natural, but cultural values need to be preserved somewhere. I think NFT is well suited for this purpose.\n\nRather than focusing on a single piece of graffiti, I chose a photo of multiple pieces of graffiti that come together to form a single landscape.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZWnRKxuXa27aSaiUaGDc3zgdy81xedMW6CdugZCcAiJ8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcMuYJ28jySfY7skmx8tjErHNUNCW68CNK7iy2wRwAgNj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZWnRKxuXa27aSaiUaGDc3zgdy81xedMW6CdugZCcAiJ8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NvmhEqecNG6qw53cNrBBtgAJAom4Haf7k"], "tags": ["graffiti", "photography", "tokyo", "street"], "extra": {}}
