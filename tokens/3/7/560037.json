It constitutes a cosmos of things exerting a spiritual action.\" ~ Wassily Kandinsky\n\nEverything flows in waves and cycles. The points where these waves meet creates new patterns and counter-waves. Waves propagate from a source but cycles from an unknown source.\n\n///\n\nAn interactive audiovisual piece. Clicking starts two loops: a bass line and a melody line. They occur in interfering rhythms. Each note flicks a resonant point in a random direction. The viewer can move the resonant points.\n\n///\n\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao) with p5.js and Tone.js.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTXPCSzJvJ78eavZCdqWWcy32uRFVqzrNzEqpUK9RyALZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUR8sFHgQjoguH3CfckyXM6XjG5U17eup5zxTRWWr7rwf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTXPCSzJvJ78eavZCdqWWcy32uRFVqzrNzEqpUK9RyALZ", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1WZuFdbESHfBSvoBeao1Wkt7NCyUuXAT9D"], "tags": ["p5js", "glsl", "webgl", "interactive", "creativecoding", "codeart", "audiovisual", "audioreactive", "audio", "tonejs", "music", "generative"], "extra": {}}
