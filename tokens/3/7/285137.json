What resulted was an EP of some of the best songs I have written to date, but as I lacked the skills and confidence in my work at the time they were never finished or released. \nTo kick off my journey into making NFT music, I decided to dust them off and put them up here for the world to see, in all their self produced, near mastered glory.\nHere in 6 parts is the \"Impressive Battle Moose, MKultra\", the unreleased, unseen EP. For fans of Baroness, Mastodon, Kylesa, Pelican and whatever other post-stoner-sludge you may be into. Or just people who like good riffs, maybe. Whatever, dig em. Grab one you like, or the whole album. I feel it's time they were heard.\nLove on and rock on.\nAll music by Jay Moon (aka analogueI_o), 2012.
