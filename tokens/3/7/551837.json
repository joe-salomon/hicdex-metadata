Flying through the spiral of sounds and melodies on a massive solid bass, the sun is shining and mushrooms are growing everywhere after the rain. We dance and celebrate creations of God, through our movement, our feelings and our intentions we bring love alive. We connect to the interconnected web of our reality and we listen to the sound of the soul.\n\nYou are all invited to enter the spiral and open the portal through music, love and dance. All three tracks are finely tuned in the frequency of 423hz, crafted with detail.\n\nAfter purchase, you will receive the original track in good quality 96/24\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmay7riHGWUXCj7UzNhynsmNBuVGwk1mQK5b1kHSnVHx2f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQumdgALeAaidUReUodPFRTfDVWNtKC2ipy3Uk9RnKQKg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmay7riHGWUXCj7UzNhynsmNBuVGwk1mQK5b1kHSnVHx2f", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PuPBWn3HDtfUqLqEPE5nmiJqY76Yae38m"], "tags": ["music", "trance", "techno", "progressive", "night", "psychedelic", "psytrance", "cosmic"], "extra": {}}
