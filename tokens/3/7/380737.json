As an original one, the very first DOGU ever, he is dear to my heart. Let him be your guide in the journey through the world of DOGU.\n\nThe White Series focuses on combining old nature pictures with the DOGUs. This is an introduction to their world. Kind of like postcards from their land.\n\nThis series consists of 6 DOGUs and one secret DOGU.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUsS9RowanjM9wjA6p3rhphprNgDViMWkfJ1RLVCkQfTa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYtcGRLqJH6BzLgQZK6ScvH28zfRP7CzWobEDFYExvsxx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUsS9RowanjM9wjA6p3rhphprNgDViMWkfJ1RLVCkQfTa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2N8TnkaCaUr9tV8Uk7mA26ucM4wq6BUL4Z"], "tags": ["dogu", "daivatt", "dogs", "dog", "illustration", "nature", "collage", "dogugrad", "doguverse"], "extra": {}}
