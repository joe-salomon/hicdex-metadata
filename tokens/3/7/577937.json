You're prayers have been answered. I made this in response to some trolls on Instagram I had gotten around this time point. I love when I'm told that I have no talent, a hack, or my kid can do that. It never ceases to amaze me how these trolls have so much time to spread hate on the internet. So many lost souls are out there. People with zero direction and hope. I engage most of the trolls that come for me. I don't yell or scream or use ALL CAPS when talking. I cut through their bullshit and ask them what happened in their lives that is causing them to project their hate / anger / fear / etc onto me. Some ignore me and keep up the charade. Others begin their own journey towards healing. This tactic works so well, that many of times these trolls become some of my biggest fans. I think the secret to dealing with bullies is being direct, ignoring the bellicose, and defusing the anger. AND VENN IT BECAME PAINFULLY OBVIOUS, HE HAD NO TALENT, is a work that uses some of the negative words said against me into something positive. Art has such an amazing healing properties. You can channel all your feelings into a work of art.
