{"__version": 1, "token_id": 500337, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Lenticular Study 003", "description": "Glitches are transient and dynamic, the product of assumptions about how a system ought to behave and reveal as much about the inner workings of that system as our relationship to it and our perceptions of it. The important thing to keep in mind is that these are not mistakes. This is just how the system was designed to behave, whether or not by intent. To see a mistake is to have something else in mind and to reject what is right in front of you, an opportunity. Sometimes we might not have the luxury of exploring those opportunities in the moment, but we should, from time to time, go back and revisit them.\n\nWe can find deeper meaning in the way a thing breaks and the realities presented to us in the evolution of that breakage. Sometimes it's not the thing that is breaking, but ourselves. The artifacts I've release here on H=N and exhibited throughout my career reflect a desire to find something beautiful in the debris of shattered expectations and hold on to it, help it grow and share it with others.\n\n1080 x 1080px 480 frame looping GIF", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc6htv3QoriEsN7x1DrCB4RUKd6zuxwsYKasVzy8WNjib", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc6htv3QoriEsN7x1DrCB4RUKd6zuxwsYKasVzy8WNjib", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc6htv3QoriEsN7x1DrCB4RUKd6zuxwsYKasVzy8WNjib", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1PZ7a2uDxKHd2NouLrDyjFVfpvpfJ3HBNR"], "tags": ["HEN500000", "500000", "HEN500K", "500KHEN", "GIF", "glitchart", "glitch", "blender", "lenticular", "3d"], "extra": {}}
