Give me back my peace and tranquility, my San Expedito! I will be grateful for the rest of my life and I will spread your name to all those who have Faith./\n\nSan Expedito is one of the most popular saints in Argentina. He is the saint of just and urgent causes.\n\nIn times of hopelessness and extreme suffering, faith plays a very important role. For a long time I thought that faith was not something that was going to mobilize me but life always surprises you and after very hard moments San Expedito helped to alleviate some of the pain.\n\nIn Buenos Aires you can see in many neighborhoods \"pasacalles\" (banners in the street) with slogans of gratitude. Somehow this piece is to thank him: \n\nThank you San Expedito for the favors conceived.\n-The Delmas Family\n\n\ud835\ude13\ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude0b\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34 (@\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude22_\ud835\ude25\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU2un6xHCcizbSRw4q6pcQ9Q4rMVLjELa9fCMYgJEcbx2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQbWSFCd65UXtXah9aVxvYmMMwfANyWimn6bqjbVFwott", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU2un6xHCcizbSRw4q6pcQ9Q4rMVLjELa9fCMYgJEcbx2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
