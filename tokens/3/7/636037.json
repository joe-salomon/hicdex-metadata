In this perspective it also has the meaning of a place of research in which the limes between inside and outside defines a sacred, interior, subjective and personal place. A dreamlike place bounded in space and boundless in time.\nThe Prussian Blue. In this color I feel the infinite: getting lost in the jar of blue velvet pigment is equivalent to taking a journey inside yourself and when I want to tell something far away, I use this pigment: gold. \nInitially I used gold leaf as a mineral element in my deep stratigraphies of the human soul; subsequently it took on the value of play, light and sacredness. \nToday it is the symbol that, mixed with my lands, traces the presence of fire.\n\nChina, ink, pigment, oil, watercolor and gold leaf on canvas 25x25 cm 2019.JPG", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd7CSYyqt1Cq4mX1Ts3SK3Wmkkw4ERpSfqKNWmxxPWSpC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeqSLdX7k8aXj6zkc7Z5sVC21rTqbrj9xKwNbtZoLSL3N", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWPz2BCJou8hMVApkjY6m6q3z5UqViaXnvNBW2vFTXEfX", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd7CSYyqt1Cq4mX1Ts3SK3Wmkkw4ERpSfqKNWmxxPWSpC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i58PMqSfkmho7EkLS2NwYnZJhvMV4jjhV"], "tags": ["BLUEMOON", "MOON", "SKY", "italy", "love", "water", "plants", "CIRCLETIME", "TIME", "ARCHETYPE", "GODNESS"], "extra": {}}
