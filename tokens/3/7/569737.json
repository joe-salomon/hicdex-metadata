This particular image is the source of a number of smaller images already out there and collected by others. I call these fragments as if they were part of a collective memory. \n\nThe framing of something, whether it be visual or mental is a strong concept that occupies a lot of my thinking on the subject of memory. \n\nThese artworks have been crafted with thoughtful insight and tender loving care. On a technical level, they mix home-brewed generative systems with hand-drawn images using Processing and GANs. \n\n1/1 Unique image that comes with a bonus 1/1 special edition for the collector.\nSize : 4100X5400 PNG [bitmap image] \n2021 | Mark Webster @motiondesign_01", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYfriHhQooJRYFBwuXY8HbKCj184ioh7zMvkVCtuDNwrK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQiZsNsdexs52ynJZbhZgsNFriCLMhnSK5pZoDN5EDgeM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYfriHhQooJRYFBwuXY8HbKCj184ioh7zMvkVCtuDNwrK", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iZbRAAsj6GfhPqiX3yCoW8F1cw7oXrxG1"], "tags": ["GANs", "neuralnet", "generative", "drawing", "Processing", "markwebster", "modular", "memories"], "extra": {}}
