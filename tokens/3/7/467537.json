I have decided to resurrect it as a series of \"video postcards\". This is a taster... mp4, 1152x824px, 35seconds(please loop), 58.8MB.\n\nIt means I will need to update my version of Processing and rewrite the code, but that should be a bit of a fun break amidst my other projects (see https://aliasrubytuesday.art). Once rewritten I'll randomly drop new postcards... hope you like them.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU3pMkjpDEox7VhLdtf3ipnwFJxDWSYBZTVPWsXERLcZ6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfDpNYtwsBUhoncCtyQ3JiW5oGrF2vQ7dKHuEAEiA3HHG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU3pMkjpDEox7VhLdtf3ipnwFJxDWSYBZTVPWsXERLcZ6", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XfBqvREuoqicfbL4oo3WBWEtFMTZbrtbk"], "tags": ["video", "videopostcard", "processing", "quanta", "invisible", "unseenuniverse", "hidden", "occult"], "extra": {}}
