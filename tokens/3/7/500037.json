The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: After having gone into a third floor bar, somewhat seedy, a sickly greenish-black person appears in the dim light. She is pale, sickly, and her cheeks are red. The bar is overcrowded; many anxious people, possibly tourists, have entered the building. The person, visibly unhappy, shuffles away. I imagine a government agency regulating \nbars like this one. I also imagine the drug dealer or user. He or she arrives in a car or on foot and walks down the center of the street, the way criminals do when they steal. They become lost. They lose their way, fall into the backs of old cars, which have been repurposed as temporary makeshift tunnels.\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 168 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYzGM34Kaya4xX16mFTeRg2By7U6FU4u5nJZPyxxxXptE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfXvCosChkmYYhphdgmQ5jGk6T4FtGaipc32w5JtTSqGt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYzGM34Kaya4xX16mFTeRg2By7U6FU4u5nJZPyxxxXptE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
