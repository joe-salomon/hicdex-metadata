The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\u2028\n~~~\n\u2028In my dream: \u201cExterminate! Impaled by a broken pin in my opponent!\u201d I shout. My opponent, a participant in the match, is on the ground, gaunt, unfamiliar to me. \u201cImpaled!\u201d I shout, aimed at his body. The match ends. I rush to the downed fighter. In the shade of a paper tiger, I swiftly lay them both out, this time with an elbow or two. They are dead, though not immediately. A third fighter, a non-combatant, enters the fray. I look to him for confirmation of the third fighter\u2019s death. He indicates that it is indeed him, that he is alright. I introduce him to the crowd, which is half screaming, the other half applauding. I tell him the third fighter was attacked by vigilantes and that is why he is dead. I meekly tell him that doesn\u2019t matter to me. I am glad when the fourth fighter is killed. There is no need to attack.\n~~~\n\u2028\nThe GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\u2028\nHumans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines.
