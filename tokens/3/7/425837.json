This is a series of 4 ZKUARE renderings. ZKUARE No. 2 lives on Solana, ZKUARE No. 3 lives on Ethereum and ZKUARE No. 4 lives on Fantom. Each cat dream is an original hand-drawn artwork collected by the katzenmalen foundation since 2018, which went through an image processing pipeline using a combination of deep dream and deep style transfer techniques which we trained with festival imagery and fine psychodelic arts. With a cat dream you will be able to join the katzenmalen artist DAO where we find ways to support kids and artists with ADHD and authism. For each cat dream created, we cover the carbon emission with planting a tree.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdVsmbAVtwMFr8CXgYy9UCd1xzhGD95a5VAekQfkeYXhf", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme4qaAo4H9Ng7UMJShQYTseuZb8E3ECi8LBhdn74p35Cz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdVsmbAVtwMFr8CXgYy9UCd1xzhGD95a5VAekQfkeYXhf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1W4WsSjxSJM1wgHmXoMjF4BxT1V2z3quQY"], "tags": ["katzenmalen"], "extra": {}}
