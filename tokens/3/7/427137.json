{"__version": 1, "token_id": 427137, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LET ME IN", "description": "This work starts a mini-mantra-series within the main sequence that abstractively takes on the concept of permissions and entitlements in various types of spaces. Where is the line drawn the line between what feel we can just do without recourse or ask for permission? Is there a line? It's obviously based on a social contract that we all have with each other, but who makes the contract and who is the arbiter/enforcer of said contract? It kind of goes back to graphic novelist Alan Moore's famous line from \"The Watchmen\", \"Who watches the watchmen?\" In the case of this work, LET ME IN can mean a number of things: physically enter a space, enter a conversation, sexual contact, or just about anything that requires some sort of permission at some level. Depending on the culture and society a person comes from can alter the parameters of social/personal permissions.
