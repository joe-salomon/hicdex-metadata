It evokes a sense of dreaming and yearning on a night where even time itself seems to stand still. Any unsold pieces will be burned after the festive period, so the poem will only be on sale for a short time.\n\nThe piece is experimental and works across multiple mediums through time. It combines classic archive footage from the past with original words and then immortalises them both using modern technology: the blockchain. The aim of the video poem project is to examine how old footage can be given new life and context within a new artistic medium.\n\nHow can we use memories of the past, captured on film but long since lapsed into historical archive? Is this footage still relevant? What feelings does it evoke today when paired with original poetry and minted using a new medium? And in answering this question, how do we use and experience our own memories? What can we do with nostalgia? Is it condemned to the past or can it be revitalised through art?\n\nA mingling of past, present and future technology with original worlds, the nostalgic sensation of the poem harks back to the early days of film, while the medium of NFT looks towards the future.\n\nEach line of the poem appears on the video along with the narration.\n\nThe poem reads:\n\nChristmas Eve at last\n\nChristmas Eve at last,\nThat night of myth and magic:\nTime seems to stand still.\n\nThrough the obliterating snow\nThe frigid, ice stopped world waits,\nAn unthawed window pane\nBreath -\n\nDreaming of you.\n\nChristmas Eve at last\nThat night of myth and magic\nTime seems to stand still.\n\nAll collectors are invited to join the storydj discord: https://discord.gg/BHcKh4fxfR", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX2zuX5QvY114aJh82a9P12XjpGaUpgo1ooGhLwGfmSNF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfJyYsqfkLgUJeQLA8mbpesaFK5G9t2koPYPjSEUfyniE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX2zuX5QvY114aJh82a9P12XjpGaUpgo1ooGhLwGfmSNF", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Q2ooX8Uzj8TgQGDfNt513aiFVZA9ABid3"], "tags": ["poem", "poetry", "videopoem", "narration", "christmas", "christmaseve", "santaclaus"], "extra": {}}
