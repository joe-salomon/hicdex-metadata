I illustrate these bastions of our cultural heritage with a stylistic key that represents me. These first 3 designs are the beginning of a collection that over time I intend to extend paying tribute to the most acclaimed animals.\n\nTHE CARPINCHO\n(Common 96 editions)\n\nCapybaras are the largest rodent in existence. It inhabits almost all of South America! Also known as Capibara which means lord of the pasture (in Guaran\u00ed) but each country puts its name to its liking. These little animals are very friendly and trusting, so their presence is not uncommon in urban areas where they used to be their natural habitat.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYv92CANP9MRPgoL416DyFMLcnn61DdHhybQMRzgT1THV", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme3row8m7wbUUDMTUQw1E6zz3MEEUfVDWYxBsVSmySnSE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYv92CANP9MRPgoL416DyFMLcnn61DdHhybQMRzgT1THV", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2PefDbra1nQXTtTk58PPn6m6HYJDmj2WR5"], "tags": ["carpincho", "animals", "art", "simbionte_arte"], "extra": {}}
