Click on the Kenny cover image to start. Then you can click on any of the digital keys to play a sound-bite from the movie. There is also a backing music track that you can play too. All artwork is original by Guiding Rock.\nThe UI/UX was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And I spent several hours collecting sound-bites and turning them into audio samples that I then assigned to keys on my MIDI keyboard. The backing music track is also original. \n\nIf the keys aren't working, try refreshing the page.\nHave fun and enjoy!\nwww.theguidingrock.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZYYnrJ8g5UH7XMwzEyyzo8BBasFh5o1AUE8DrkG7a1e3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfTDe7yHymYPBKwVsU8yPMtWVN9jd1PspQXNJ1HfovEJi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZYYnrJ8g5UH7XMwzEyyzo8BBasFh5o1AUE8DrkG7a1e3", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hnmpvKPDDnXfh9tkE2ouWG2rP3uaUVjC4"], "tags": ["halfbaked", "weed", "marijuana", "thc", "high", "interactive", "html", "css", "javascript", "digital", "keyboard", "audio", "sound", "movie", "davechappelle", "guiellermodiaz", "jimbreuer", "harlandwilliams", "cool", "rare", "unique", "awesome", "guidingrock", "fun"], "extra": {}}
