All artworks are created using custom algorithms in processing.\nThis collection has an abstract look at Iranian carpets, Iranian art-industrial carpets that have long overshadowed Iranian culture as a name and credit for Iran.\nThese kilim rugs show a decisive difference to hand-knotted rugs - they are woven by hand. Thus, they do not have a high pile of wool and are often flatter and rougher than knotted wool rugs. Their making is less elaborate and so they are usually much more affordable. As an advantage, kilim rugs are also much lighter and can be laid out from the front and backside. Hand-woven kilims originally come from the former Persia and are now also often made in Afghanistan. They have rather simple, straightforward patterns, which are determined by their weaving technique.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRszdG5W7KYEJRKQf6kMxjk9E4Ask2MfnVavrYxMrj1VC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRszdG5W7KYEJRKQf6kMxjk9E4Ask2MfnVavrYxMrj1VC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRszdG5W7KYEJRKQf6kMxjk9E4Ask2MfnVavrYxMrj1VC", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SSCjgL54U5yUemQVFGfZ9M9ygKHLHgNsA"], "tags": ["generativeart", "creativecoding", "generative", "codeart", "newmediaart", "abstract", "creativecodeart", "algorithmicart", "touchdesigner", "object4objekt", "generativedesign", "processing", "mathart", "computerart", "proceduralart", "geometricart", "procedural", "isometric", "bhfyp", "geometry", "pattern", "GEOMATIC", "aiart", "artxcode", "minimal", "psychedelic", "glsl", "psychedelicart", "opart", "genartclub", "noise", "trippy", "opticalart", "artandtechnology", "coding", "audiovisual", "pyton", "p5js", "hen200k", "shahrokh", "machinelearning", "pixelart", "pixels", "rare", "1"], "extra": {}}
