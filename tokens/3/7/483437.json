Not only can we find formations portal-ish, but nature itself can be a portal (to another world, to our innerself).  \n\nOne take I have from this type of experience: we are nature itself, that's a fact; but we have to be careful to not decay in the antropocentric abism... So if you accept one advice: go take a trip into nature, don't let you become a victim of the ecological (and botanical) blindeness that is contaminating a good part of our society. And you just need one plant, one animal, fungus, to go on this trip - and I'm sure that's at least one of them right next to you :) there's none excuses.\n \n\u2739 Find you a good beautiful portal and find love \u2739\n\nI'm a brazilian artist, you can find me on twitter by @ocvvvlta.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf59uSs5JmLhikeZBsNsFbkz8q4KwE3NqNczz8yJaVAhQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdx3QzFNt8VErDE8aLtge8nABJMNg15gGxfwDygFXg978", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf59uSs5JmLhikeZBsNsFbkz8q4KwE3NqNczz8yJaVAhQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tk4hbkA49TPyyqyLYBLBygz7S2nRCMQpd"], "tags": ["photograph", "nature", "naturephotograph", "photography", "nftphotobr", "photez", "purple", "portal", "brazilianartist"], "extra": {}}
