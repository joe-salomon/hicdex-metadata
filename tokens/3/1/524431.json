Inspired by the pure rage I harbor for owners and management figures that feign familial bonds or extend friendly bullshit half-measures in order to more successfully exploit the people working under them.  Just because you're paid well, or you get great benefits, or free lunch on Fridays, it will never negate the fact that YOU are doing them the favor of sacrificing your time and sweat for a disproportionate amount of their profits. Original can be printed up to 21x15 inches without distortion.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR4QtmxGgb4PcXV7aNzHoUy8wjLFP8JLEnPXv2ufpnC14", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTJijUd5GNk1iJJTs9HxqYHN2TAwQgoTKoiXxDgmdssXP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR4QtmxGgb4PcXV7aNzHoUy8wjLFP8JLEnPXv2ufpnC14", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dVdtu6ZDXeUfgmGrfSx8JQFMBjhagwQYy"], "tags": ["painting", "digital", "procreate", "sculpture", "original", "abstract", "surreal", "weird", "punk"], "extra": {}}
