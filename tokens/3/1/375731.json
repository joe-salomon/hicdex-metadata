{"__version": 1, "token_id": 375731, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Morondanga Republik: Sandra Mort", "description": "Sandra Mort was a peculiar and very talented artist of the 16th century. Born in Morondanga Republik and raised in a traditional family, decided to run away from her parents' home and moved into a convent where she lived for several years in hiding (she was fleeing from a marriage her family had arranged with a third cousin to whom they owed a lot of money).\n\nAt the convent, she earned her living by painting erotic scenes on canvases of all kinds, which the nuns paid her for with fruit and books. \n\nHer fame was already important when King Philomenus invited her to portray his mother, Queen Verena. \"The Dead Queen\" was the work that ultimately catapulted her to unprecedented success.\n\nThe collection of five paintings called \"Hypocrite Monarchs\" is part of the eccentric and elegant decoration in Ophelia's immense house of more than a thousand rooms.\n\nSome say that Ofelia herself is Sandra's great-great-great-granddaughter. Others claim that Sandra never married, never had children, and died in total and complete freedom.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcGWf8EU6XrWcqggBxfx91TFJtAnnBPXYGp6aVDJWtxh6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTum8LjmV8B4TpAkkztiyS6FKERqVttEiph1NewoKefi9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcGWf8EU6XrWcqggBxfx91TFJtAnnBPXYGp6aVDJWtxh6", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Stamp", "Morondanga", "Artist"], "extra": {}}
