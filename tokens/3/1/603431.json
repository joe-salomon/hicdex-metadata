Now a 1 of 1 piece. \n\nSince October being on this wonderful HEN platform, I've notice themes of skulls being used in a lot of works. \n\nThis fascinates me because around the same time I became aware of the 17th century art term \"Vanitas\" where the skull was a symbol and representation of a life fullfiled.\n\nThe term originally comes from the opening lines of the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible and went onto to translate as vanity. But the root meaning in the bible comes from Hebrew word hevel,which means\"vapor\".\n\nSo in Ecclesiastes the line \"Vanity of Vanities! All is vanity\" does not mean \"everything is meaningless\" which a lot of people misunderstand it for, but it means \"everything is fleating\" .. Like the life of a bubble.
