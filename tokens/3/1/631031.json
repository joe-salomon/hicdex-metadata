But as I started painting, a part of me thought it would be a good exercise to be /okay/ with it being me \u2013 that the piece itself didn't need to be scary, but the process of sharing it so publicly and permanently, absolutely could be.\n\nSo I hobbled this thing together \u2013 frames meant to be used as reference, animated in different styles (with zero planning), some that I like, and others I don't even understand myself. I might have liked the result of my original concept more (it certainly would've made more sense) but it's felt like a greater artistic step for me, publishing whatever the hell this thing is.\n\n\u26e7\n\n@microwave_cooks", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZiF8y2wHvesbo2E7GHB1KBYz5XKfqhSjDC63Wrd5b9i4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZiF8y2wHvesbo2E7GHB1KBYz5XKfqhSjDC63Wrd5b9i4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZiF8y2wHvesbo2E7GHB1KBYz5XKfqhSjDC63Wrd5b9i4", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2Td8xyvPN6FoE18RUoEFbVyJugkrbYgky6"], "tags": ["microwave", "halloween", "dickspo"], "extra": {}}
