{"__version": 1, "token_id": 510231, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "RAIN IN IRAN / REIGN IN IRAN / REIN IN IRAN", "description": "What started off as part of an anagram quickly diverged into homophone territory on this one. The letters in the country IRAN can be anagrammed into the word RAIN. I thought about all the tears in Iran. All the beautiful people, culture, food, sights, music, art, mosaics and so much more in Iran. And then I thought about the theocratic government there and how brutal their regime is to their people. Such an incredible history to these ancient peoples, only to be usurped by religious zealots. Then again, we come from the West where that part of the world is taught to us to be sworn enemies. We don't want enemies. We don't want hate. We don't want war. We want everyone to be free to be who they are or want to be. RAIN IN IRAN quickly became REIGN IN IRAN, which became REIN IN IRAN. One day we will all be free, we just need to keep our hearts and minds open to receive them when that time comes. We love you Iran.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUF6oLW9xq1cL2FFLTis3JdbNLCkAmW3w2VYSNAP64pam", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeuRfrDV47JHAwfTrfxX1ELzrB9SyEBTjGumwUtYfTDU1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUF6oLW9xq1cL2FFLTis3JdbNLCkAmW3w2VYSNAP64pam", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
