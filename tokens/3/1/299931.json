He is the younger son of Aru\u1e47a and his wife Shyeni, as well as the brother of Sampati and an old friend of Dasharatha (Rama's father - Rama Sinta, Ramayana Story).\n\nAra\u1e47ya-K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da of Ramayana mentions that Jatayu is the \"King of Vultures\"(g\u1e5bdhrar\u0101ja). According to the epic, the demon Ravana was abducting the goddess Sita to Lanka when Jatayu tried to rescue her. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old Ravana soon defeated him, clipping his wings, and Jayatu falls down to earth. Rama and Lakshmana while on the search for Sita, chanced upon the stricken and dying Jatayu, who informed them of the battle with Ravana and told them that Ravana had headed South. Jatayu then died of his wounds and Rama performed his final funeral rites.\n\n---\n\nJatayu\n4500 x 5400\nRakaJana", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigvdnpvx5ty2mmx7bqoiyiw2d3ptvklptc2hvr56nmfiewvqkyaki", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibnsx5kk4fpchfblebyy2sa6nvb7ndwuo54kyi3jqdg267ip7o4le", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigvdnpvx5ty2mmx7bqoiyiw2d3ptvklptc2hvr56nmfiewvqkyaki", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WyqapuXM2ieFydW1Q6g7DXPnbwAfZbw8D"], "tags": ["jatayu", "ramayana", "hindu", "bali", "creator", "mythology", "rakajana", "mask", "digital", "illustrator", "indonesia"], "extra": {}}
