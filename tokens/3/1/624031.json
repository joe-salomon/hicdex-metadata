Then I had to make the acheivement requirements more difficult and I resolved in adding the constraint to have 180 followers too (I doubled the 100)\n\nTo be honest the artwork is not finished yet: there are inconstistent behaviours depending on browsers and other external factors, but as I'm writing those lines I may get 1 more follower and need to raise the achievement bar again.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWcPEGTo9wYwnUcaphXBdMR1WaGZwfKFRSsnwUiYQfkcz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTnn3K8Es47mgjGt4DWjZYax3NYuUhXEkuL158S3ZbXAB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWcPEGTo9wYwnUcaphXBdMR1WaGZwfKFRSsnwUiYQfkcz", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1TRo6E7mkWVXXbr6bqadKozg3yV3FhnbL2"], "tags": ["interactive", "100", "180", "100(*2=180)", "Beppe"], "extra": {}}
