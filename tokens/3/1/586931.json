The only thing that truly exists is now. At least that's the way you and I and everyone in the world perceives the forward direction of time. So if time is relative to where you are compared to a large source of gravity, like say being on the same planet together...at the same time. But how do we know that your now and my now are the exact same now? Can we definitively say that no matter where you are in the world, it's always now? From our own myopic microcosms of reality we think so, but let's say one person was at the bottom of Mt. Everest and another was at the top. They're both ON the planet technically, but the person at the top is further away from the center of gravity, the center of the Earth. Technically, time for this person should be slightly different than the person at the bottom of the mountain. So can we fully say the title of this is correct? Yes and no. For us on Earth the difference in time is almost negligible, but there is a difference. Time is one crazy concept when you think of it. And time isn't a separate entity...it's interwoven with Space to create Spacetime, the fabric of reality; of our universe. It's absolutely mind boggling and it makes me want to make more art about it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYnpN6iVVzvwRAg82MnZsPUnRLgBxq97ApobUMdfKAnyS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUkAYwQvQvbQNrdo78CTnGL4k2bK5sXYkVHNfVZptxPBz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYnpN6iVVzvwRAg82MnZsPUnRLgBxq97ApobUMdfKAnyS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
