Please Stand By, Video Games Are Only For Weekends. In an attempt to prevent young children from becoming addicted to video games, China recently banned kids under the age of 18 from playing video games during the week and will only allow them to play between 8-9 PM on Friday\u2019s, weekends and public holidays. This is an escalation of a previous policy that had limited them to 90 minutes on weekdays and 3 hours on weekends. Restrictions like these are nothing new in Asian countries, in 2011 South Korea passed the Cinderella Law which stated no one under the age of 16 could play video games between 12AM and 6AM, and while not country wide, prefectures in Japan have also installed restrictions. And although the Cinderella law was abolished this year and Japan has faced an uphill battle implementing their laws, America has a golden opportunity here! An opportunity to finally beat 14 year Asian kids in Overwatch. With their playing time limited, and skills rusty, it\u2019s time to strike! Ha! We\u2019ll show you!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihvfxzw5w526htzbgcexzoeqs3td5yu57ij7u66xrs3w6oyps5cqe", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigpp2v3clwmyrv6m6r3w3mu34fmva4jf3sgdndvme7im4y6pmwf7y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihvfxzw5w526htzbgcexzoeqs3td5yu57ij7u66xrs3w6oyps5cqe", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
