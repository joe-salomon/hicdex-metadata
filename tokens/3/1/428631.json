By the blue light of their pcs, they knew they must each wander Cryptovoxels at that very moment. The stars aligned, and they wandered into Stellabelle's Gallery at the same time. Instantly, they knew they had to form a punk band. \"The Lynettes\" were conceived. Their first album, \"Gutterverse\" is due out in November. \"I Want to Fuck an NFT\" is their new single.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeScu2PtgDqyi37jDeZzbisHPLKhb1qJaj9JzkYauiHgK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeScu2PtgDqyi37jDeZzbisHPLKhb1qJaj9JzkYauiHgK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeScu2PtgDqyi37jDeZzbisHPLKhb1qJaj9JzkYauiHgK", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Z49LKCgmHrtepXcEfZ8k3wKM5PwhJfLHn"], "tags": ["loopityloop", "illustration", "Gutterverse", "Synovial-Ambrosia"], "extra": {}}
