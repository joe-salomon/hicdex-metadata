Cheering crowds lined the streets and gathered at the scaffold to witness the hanging of Martha and the four men \n\nShe never relented as, even from the scaffold, her voice was heard asserting her innocence refusing to confess to \"a falsehood so filthy\"\n\nHer body was dragged to a common grave between the rocks about two feet deep where she joined the bodies of George Burroughs and John Willard\n\nIn 1711, her family received a small amount of recompense from the Massachusetts government for her conviction: 7 pounds and 6 shillings \n\nThe Massachusetts government apologized to Thomas Carrier for the hanging of his wife and reversed the conviction \n\nThe Salem documents themselves reveal that her crime was not witchcraft but an independence of mind and an un-submissive character\n\nOne of a series working with AI to give face to women executed as witches; these form part of a broader collection of Horror Portraits at www.horrorportraits.xyz\n\n#WitchingHourOnHEN \n\nCan be used as #PFP and #wallpaper\n\nPNG 4800 x 4800", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZPATPQQChHxkQV2dSmAGHJrWLm9GT5tQP6aS7AZmV9dB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPswGuD5Ww5bKSb1UzQfvP3aLdQZKpFmp1dAEJtbmXuQd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZPATPQQChHxkQV2dSmAGHJrWLm9GT5tQP6aS7AZmV9dB", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NWtHHck4dxpwCSGVrboat83R9STyLfmfA"], "tags": ["#witchinghouronhen", "stevemunro", "witchtrials", "salemwitchtrials", "salem", "MarthaCarrier", "horrorportraits", "portraits", "#pfp", "witch", "goth", "death", "gan", "#pfps", "horror", "darkart", "generativeart", ""], "extra": {}}
