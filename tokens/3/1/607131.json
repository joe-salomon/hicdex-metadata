You can try it at hydra.ojack.com.\n\nI use Hydra for almost everything I make in this space. It is very intuitive to me and it never seizes to surprise. The three pieces that make up this series are minted on a collaborative contract with a wallet created by the collective Hydra-users on Tezos for the purpose of helping the development of Hydra. \n\n50 % of the profits of this piece will automatically be sent to Hydra through OpenCollective (https://opencollective.com/hydra-synth).\n\nFINDING YOUR WAY IN A MAZE OF OPPORTUNITY is as much about my personal journey through Hydra, as it is a metaphor for how I feel about the entire NFT space. \n\nCoded in Amsterdam with Hydra. \ndecember 2021.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdp6rnXTX9F3VDk5yFLtTkyDszcKqopvH4xaPNDKTeDzf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNaKFPREodzmt3KhGDSLyToXnfYMAs9Tfkhpg8625itUT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdp6rnXTX9F3VDk5yFLtTkyDszcKqopvH4xaPNDKTeDzf", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["KT1Vg6YZpWARxBchhhEhPRjU3vxk5Bee3BuD"], "tags": ["interactive", "hydra", "generative", "lines", "color", "dnlsmm", "noise"], "extra": {}}
