They prefer to call themselves Bororo. Fulani are a nomadic people who have been influential in regional politics, economics, and histories throughout western Africa for over a thousand years. Wodaabe live in northern Nigeria and played a significant role in furthering Fulani domination in the area. The height of the Fulani empire was between the early 1800s and early 1900s.\nAppearance - long nose, round head, light skin and white teeth - is an ideal feature, especially for men. Wodaabe sometimes wears makeup to enhance these charms but also to attract young girls.\n- digital painting\n- size :3508*4342", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeooerkJ6sV1AHRTmhE9ommN32nALGyP3w5RCUbzueq6p", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYFamj34R738znb2c6T3VkX5CSgMSf4cWxw5onH9QpYQU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmPDM8fe8pb7fUEsspVdVRuVRxGW5pFJALVcSjWmmZCyj6", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeooerkJ6sV1AHRTmhE9ommN32nALGyP3w5RCUbzueq6p", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WhXGPFtC5nkcLNG5njDwLvM2yvu9oUkvc"], "tags": ["hicetnunc2000-hen2000-hicetnuncart-digitalpainting"], "extra": {}}
