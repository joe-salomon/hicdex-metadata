Since childhood I was taking figure skating classes, and I still skating and compete at shows! This sport is my hobby and fulfilling activity for soul. This artwork and upcoming movie itself are incredibly important for me, because they imprint my unique experience being a figure skater. I want to show fun backstage aspects of this beautiful sport in the film. \n\nCollectors which are supporting my art will receive a mention in the final titles of the movie. I'm trying to raise money from my NFTs for the production of the cartoon, because I want to become an independent director without a need to ask government or private studios for financing as I used to do before.\n\nI'm grateful for every purchase and any support!
