A future digital folklore artefact. Continuing ancient folk art traditions used to pass on information & myth across space and time.\n\nCreated by hybrid generative/manual-generative method, where i insert myself into the loop of a generative process taking over some parts of the function to better control and guide the artwork. Unlike other Negative Time landscapes, these pieces were created native for crypto/multiverse space using virtual/generative landscapes as the starting point.\n\n\nFebruary 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYvSsCVuJsAQ4StUUhVtL8996sx3TYt5yQdPf6Xe6xvvN", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcu7JrvLZNoQLQZbHNd3QDPz1dojnSADosHQdLMG9wUAA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYvSsCVuJsAQ4StUUhVtL8996sx3TYt5yQdPf6Xe6xvvN", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1i8QudJEMQPvbAdG55Jy282zVu7912C5Ms"], "tags": ["generative", "landscape", "manualgenerative", "glitch", "cartography", "map", "flag", "digitalfolklore"], "extra": {}}
