{"__version": 1, "token_id": 497931, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "GRIMHILDE", "description": "In Norse mythology, Grimhildr (or Grimhilde) was a sorceress married to King Gyuki, one of the Burgundian kings, and her story appears in the Volsunga Saga, where she is described as a \u201cfierce-hearted woman.\u201d Grimhildr was easily bored, and often amused herself by enchanting various people\u2014including the hero Sigur\u00f0r, who she wanted to see marry her daughter Gudrun. The spell worked, and Sigur\u00f0r left his wife Brynhild. As if that wasn\u2019t enough mischief-making, Grimhildr decided her son Gunnar should marry the spurned Brynhild, but Brynhild didn't like the idea. She said that she would only marry a man who was willing to a cross a ring of fire for her. So Brynhild created a circle of flames around herself and dared her potential suitors to cross it.\n\nSigur\u00f0r, who could cross the flames safely, knew that he\u2019d be out of trouble if he could see his ex happily remarried, so he offered to switch bodies with Gunnarr and get across. And who had enough magic to make the body-swapping work out? Grimhildr, of course. Brynhild was fooled into marrying \u200bGunnarr, but it didn\u2019t end well; she finally figured out she\u2019d been tricked, and ended up killing Sigur\u00f0r and herself. The only one who came out of the whole debacle relatively unscathed was Gudrun, whose malicious mother ended up marrying her off to Brynhild\u2019s brother, Atli.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcQTBhQauAKNuKCTCq5KUuCW73nPYF9sxaaQeBmyg3dgW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPbEGpPof8cNDVqfwy7tqoK6paBY86pXriih5hiSuFCF1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcQTBhQauAKNuKCTCq5KUuCW73nPYF9sxaaQeBmyg3dgW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dK9TmuWBntZSBAwfDRceLAQ431NETDYmd"], "tags": ["NFTArtist", "NFTArt", "NFTCommunity", "DarkNFT", "NFTCollector"], "extra": {}}
