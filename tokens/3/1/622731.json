Living in the city and staying inside with my family was really driving me mad (it's always been a thing for me, even before corona), so the solution I found was to run towards nature as much as I could. Traveling and hiking to know new places and being in silence had a curing effect on my body and soul. I could finally think straight. This painting is about being a ghost withing the forest, inconspicuous to others but myself and nature. Empty, traveling light, shining, relaxed and back to Gaia again. Some weed and mushrooms were involved too.\n \nMade with:\n\n- 300gsm watercolor paper\n- Watercolor\n- Nankin pen", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUecxjv6b9WnkFtZjFq8yTwbHJsVeHg61N4VjSP7g1fXf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXQ2hsyfFVHv99LkCBVq6Vn3KiTeFkrccWo3NKhZtJBHQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUecxjv6b9WnkFtZjFq8yTwbHJsVeHg61N4VjSP7g1fXf", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RkQFcwXPPpYZtP8M1Yv2TCYLuALbqpx43"], "tags": ["illustration", "watercolor", "nankin", "spiritualjourney", "garden", "quarantine", "corona", "nft"], "extra": {}}
