Each of these pixels expands to form a 300-pixel straight line in a random direction. The width of each line is 1, 2 or 3 pixels, value selected at random with weights of 8, 2 and 1 respectively.\n\nWith this technique a textile texture or something similar is achieved.\n\nSize: 4578 x 5216 px.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaHfXszqnwnNqD1syPoknSeeHHJpSc45MWuVnbugvdPtP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcsqmiS6Jpyym4wcF9HLDEr7LPAC6WWHVTu8RyJr58RoV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaHfXszqnwnNqD1syPoknSeeHHJpSc45MWuVnbugvdPtP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gMYXjqi7sxsdu9PGYgicrWZvz41mpvsCF"], "tags": ["genart", "generative", "generativeart", "python", "pillow", "creativecode", "creativecoding", "cleannft", "colorful", "codeart", "creativecoding", "pearlearring", "vermeer"], "extra": {}}
