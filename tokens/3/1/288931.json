According to the Shahnameh, Zal, the son of Saam, was born albino. When Saam saw his albino son, he assumed that the child was the spawn of devils, and abandoned the infant on the mountain Alborz.\n\n\n The Shahnameh (\u201cBook of Kings\u201d, composed 977-1010 CE) is a medieval epic written by the poet Abolqasem Ferdowsi (l. c. 940-1020 CE) in order to preserve the myths, legends, history, language, and culture of ancient Persia. It is the longest work by a single author in world literature at a length of 50,000 rhymed couplets, 62 stories, and 990 chapters.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihykexg2gwgrp7pnbrrxbpod6lh6bejgihqa5dby4zhrtrnvx5fty", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibgkixhogtoowwo2aura5ursayih4ewp3efepru6vwqhoya3g3qnq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihykexg2gwgrp7pnbrrxbpod6lh6bejgihqa5dby4zhrtrnvx5fty", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["Seemorgh", "bigbird", "legend", "creature", "creative", "persianart", "persian", "ferdowsi", "white", "nft", "nftcommunity", "conceptart", "2d", "art", "character", "collection"], "extra": {}}
