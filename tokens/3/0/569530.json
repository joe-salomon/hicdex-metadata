He\u2019s the only grandparent I have left & now I miss him a lot (he lives in Borneo while I live in West Java). He\u2019s my charm that I wish will never fade away.\n\nHopefully you can feel the warm, hear the laughter, and smell the good food we usually have on his birthday.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWAG1a56Qea6Jo1qstwBS9hagD3QAhWyDCNaka9LNKKyj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNgxviWmC46pKuxHGNGB7TerqWFGGHVezYrNLdSpUdNmB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWAG1a56Qea6Jo1qstwBS9hagD3QAhWyDCNaka9LNKKyj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PdGThHGV3Dj96b7nkeJ6KxPf8x9sZjyP9"], "tags": ["warm", "birthday", "celebration", "2D", "colorful", "illustration", "digitalillustration", "christmas"], "extra": {}}
