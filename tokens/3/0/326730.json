It is supported by a dynamic relationship between its two residency partners: the Vigeland Museum and queer live events co-ordinators Karmaklubb*. The project revisits the work of Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland (1869-1943) to investigate past and future constructions of gender, race, sexuality, age, body politics, and the notion of the ideal human. Building on Karmaklubb*\u2019s agendas, it aims to probe the social and digital cultures arising from discussions and practices around genetics and the body, and to establish a hub within global conversations about future impacts of design technologies on our bodies.
