Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical substance, the racemic free base, which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms. It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, among other concerns, as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger central nervous system stimulant than levomethamphetamine.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWgaozhMZuP8mYnyhQPHouuyboozJa7wHYF59FAY4oBiz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWgaozhMZuP8mYnyhQPHouuyboozJa7wHYF59FAY4oBiz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWgaozhMZuP8mYnyhQPHouuyboozJa7wHYF59FAY4oBiz", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "nft", "collectible", "methamphetamine", "drugs"], "extra": {}}
