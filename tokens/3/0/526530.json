This piece was previously in black and white with no title, but at the moment I changed the color to red, the vibrations of the work gained a new scope of meaning, which gave its title: Heartbeat.]\n\n~\n\nBoiling Ideas is a series of visual compositions accompanied by notes. The concept of this collection is to share insights about art/image/history, and express them visually, while keeping the process experimental, and fun.\n\nI embrace the instability of my hand to fell more present in my works, and turn mistakes into a creative process frame by frame (see: Boil Line Animation). My goal is to share the best pieces of knowledge that I\u2019ve acquired studying during my life.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme1p37AmNyjcDgSPpxgJr5uRHhJX1Pcxv49gWqXWemAR9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme1p37AmNyjcDgSPpxgJr5uRHhJX1Pcxv49gWqXWemAR9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme1p37AmNyjcDgSPpxgJr5uRHhJX1Pcxv49gWqXWemAR9", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1a4K3LJWGytziUrterBqrZXPUGs3fJ8UEM"], "tags": ["boilingideas", "gif", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
