(fun)\n\nAfter technology installs itself in the world and starts to erase the magical specter of planet earth, a small girl begins to appear along the banks of the city's stream.\n\nShe is Tanoshi, a spirit of a girl who was buried alive beneath the city's great buildings. Now it haunts the surroundings of the stream and causes confusion to passersby, because at this time the human being no longer knows what magic, mysticism or anything within the spiritual spectrum is.\n\nShe is sadistic and plays with the bodies of her victims, making them agonize in pain while screaming cute words, to show how much that world is ''fun''.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVkN1YvfCAKQr37UeYraykbhdRyNQ1ahpLsLV8dYbkyJQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX9SXCc9VkX1aWDnCg32bXrgqgwWnuGdHLzMNHV7Nrvoh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVkN1YvfCAKQr37UeYraykbhdRyNQ1ahpLsLV8dYbkyJQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LNPJStnAGnRnx4XGz6Negm7TVfA3ub7ZH"], "tags": ["woman", "cyberpunk", "digitalart", "illustration", "vaporwave", "art", "colorful", "pink", "nft", "gore"], "extra": {}}
