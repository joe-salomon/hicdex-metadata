Dinn! Dinn! Dinn!\n\nLet us eat air, rock, coal, iron.\nTurn, my hungers.\nFeed, hungers, in the meadow of sounds!\nSuck the gaudy poison of the convolvuli;\nEat, the stones a poor man breaks,\nthe old masonry of churches, boulders,\nchildren of floods, loaves lying in the grey valleys!\n\nHungers, it is bits of black air; the azure trumpeter;\nit is my stomach that makes me suffer.\nIt is unhappiness. Leaves have appeared on earth!\nI go looking for the sleepy flesh of fruit.\nAt the heart of the furrow I pick\nVenus' looking-glass and the violet.\n\nMy hunger, Anne, Anne, flee on your donkey.\n//", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNYE1JgSH3MgDt7qGwQgfak5T4eoxyCDQrkDAWnaZgg8Y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYMNZcKeavVZUeb6EbeDGXVGEXm4cMc7JcsRmWocJSusg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNYE1JgSH3MgDt7qGwQgfak5T4eoxyCDQrkDAWnaZgg8Y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2HwWbLmm2wzL8sNCJYQrBYMKYGTZSdHz31"], "tags": ["poem", "new", "limited", "rare", "heart", "love", "meta", "flower", ""], "extra": {}}
