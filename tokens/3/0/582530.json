I\u2019ve been in Ha\u00efti when I was a kid and here in Manila, I almost felt like home. The energy in countries in the South is similar whether you are in Asia, Africa or Latin America.\nThis kid was having his best time, the last time I saw these toys it was in history books at school. I was hypnotised by his passion. When I got back home, my father saw the picture and told me \u00ab Oh I used to have the same toy when I was a kid \u00bb", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcuF8zRGMUeCpvb5TojDYzECZDq8q1WdieHGzeeDVQg5s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdanMaLowxZFLfbv7abnLnHs7V3WkY5L1msEQe9ZumXaK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcuF8zRGMUeCpvb5TojDYzECZDq8q1WdieHGzeeDVQg5s", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aKiiz1QARnrGHRWRsq3tkUyk3p3U8kioQ"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "storytelling", "art", "35mm", "manila", "kid", "kids", "fun", "feeling", "toy"], "extra": {}}
