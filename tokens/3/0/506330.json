This collection takes inspiration from multiple themes: Virus structure, Fractal imagery, Ink blotters (Rorschach Test), The Universe and Hidden Masonic themes. Each style was created a different way and each one challenging the mind to see past face value and to discover what lies on the inside. This release has more meaning and messaging to it than any of my other work to date. Each image is a 2048 x 2048 1/1 jpg image.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQoK7M1y8P3kTcLuHoaEJahNqnwf85uiauqx6yMmaGhVH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNi8EBPDvQLndLNKJt5L2BEw8s2Q9A9rq88P9LPKx1nwk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQoK7M1y8P3kTcLuHoaEJahNqnwf85uiauqx6yMmaGhVH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XFZNug9TTgL8DzmuLc263t1tBdPKUgo1E"], "tags": ["1/1", "Universe", "Blackandwhite", "Plasmaclouds"], "extra": {}}
