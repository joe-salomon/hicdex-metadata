Much as they failed to come together to save their species from the systemic collapse of their planet\u2019s ecosystem they also failed to find salvation together.\n\nMany isolated efforts, nations and corporations created their own interstellar ships and technologies and fled for the stars. On humanity's new home, the only known surviving effort is the British expedition.\n\nIt may be that there are other colonies on the new planet but the uncoordinated effort and disparate technology saw mixed results. What fate befell the others is unknown, and the burden as the last hope of humanity hangs heavy on the colony\u2019s citizens.  \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeif23vxxbpe5x7uatjgd4ndconwwgpqtc2vlnbjlwk6bmi5xxag3va", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigmi42r6f6fwazko7xxsdsxqheqrjgbusdxngp6jgmwdszst6y3xa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeif23vxxbpe5x7uatjgd4ndconwwgpqtc2vlnbjlwk6bmi5xxag3va", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["vessels", "lorecard06"], "extra": {}}
