The runes on this item are used for protection of the spirit. The first use cleanses spiritual energy and the second creates a barrier to protect from further spiritual assault. Engraved into the bits of the given item is a prayer for protection and cleansing. If you feel like you are in need of some extra energetic protection, I am offering this trade to you. Make the transaction with the intention of using that energy to destroy any negative spiritual energy afflicting you. Say to yourself \"As I accept this gift, any negative energy attached to me will pass into the vessel.\" Then, burn the token with the intention of release. Say again to yourself, \"as I release this gift, so does the negative energy release from me.\" May your spirit be at peace, and may your intention to be free endure.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQTFi6pG6WMhsKfaBXWdvFPcGyPbJ5LLbRoB4yBJ4tMoN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU7Njs9GMsMzep3fW86m9MAJuYHcwhDQhe1Mgkk7eBotV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQTFi6pG6WMhsKfaBXWdvFPcGyPbJ5LLbRoB4yBJ4tMoN", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Vr5jqStWBNpnHPG34yesq898EjHVrAmfe"], "tags": ["Cleansing", "protection", "power", "safety", "love", "release", "freedom", "karmicrelease"], "extra": {}}
