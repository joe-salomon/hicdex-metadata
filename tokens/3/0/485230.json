South Africa.\n\u201cThe Quagga were reported to have gathered in herds of 30 to 50, sometimes traveling in a linear fashion over the arid Karoo plains.\u201d  \n\nUsing steganography, each frame of this mp4 file has been encoded with a segment of the sequenced DNA of the Quagga. This video therefore hides the genetic code of the animal within.  \n\n#ExtinctAnimals is a collection of pixelated fauna representing the last specimens of species that disappeared from earth. Bright pixels, fossil records and genetic descendants are all we have left. As an NFT, each of these images is unique, finite, and scarce -- much like the last extinct animals they depict.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYLbFMNEkqJy6cjgF7usNxdwFsSCY5UtMobx1xYWeQyXs", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma5b3fRwb6yLx12RJF1p1cacAmtpr1Xcw42H2kCWqSLEH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYLbFMNEkqJy6cjgF7usNxdwFsSCY5UtMobx1xYWeQyXs", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NdE7FmyWQxLky7n2NpVaa2ioujTfqdigi"], "tags": ["extinctanimals", "steganography", "quagga", "dna", "3d", "pixelart"], "extra": {}}
