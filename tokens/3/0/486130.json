They are printed as physical stickers in one-off limited print runs and sold at White Duck Espresso drive-thru espresso stands until they're sold out.\n\nGIFs are created from each sticker design, and only 5 are minted of each month.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUnYo7mw8YJnKP3BMvRGAyXuKUvbxha5aESam3dNynUnk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUnYo7mw8YJnKP3BMvRGAyXuKUvbxha5aESam3dNynUnk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUnYo7mw8YJnKP3BMvRGAyXuKUvbxha5aESam3dNynUnk", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZtGf829TEA2nazeqmycuRWs8pPrvfZpG8"], "tags": ["whiteduckstickers", "whiteducksticker", "whiteduck", "tinybirdpress", "robgrohman"], "extra": {}}
