The intent is now to depict that which we cannot see \u2013 the intangible world of Heaven and the spiritual.\n\nThe shapes and the colors of this piece recall the tonality of ancient mosaics and the noble presence of one of the longest-lasting empires in human history.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaQBbDV67Efrp8hziZw2WyM8F5WFr4dnxxEjfZ9TJ1S2X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQPRFptTAgQ5FwCayLGnFDWKSo1nzBp4TL8YzgEJwpZ6X", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaQBbDV67Efrp8hziZw2WyM8F5WFr4dnxxEjfZ9TJ1S2X", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SLNVkcr3fPmAgWi4oWC9GhoGKY6brTeEq"], "tags": ["artwork", "2d", "non-generative"], "extra": {}}
