Be aware some of their treatment is not understandable.\n\nMen, be aware of yourselves and do not be too greedy for what is in the world. You have eaten too much of women's rights. Degrading women is not something that should be understood. Women have more power than you. Remember it well.\n\nTherefore, women, shake the world with what you have. Fight against all forms of oppression against you, your rights. Oppose how the different treatment of investors in the factory towards women. Fight how feudal culture makes you weak and helpless.\n\nKick them all!!
