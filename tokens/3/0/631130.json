Indeed, for Doctors, medical staffs, educators they do need some qualifications. But for myself, I believe I don't need one. My graduation will come very soon. I am an art student. I study to become an artist, but after studying for almost 4 years. I still found zero clue, on how to become an artist. I believe that the system/curriculum itself wasn't made by an artist or a true art practitioner in field. \n\nI will not let myself step into another rat-race. My whole life has been a rat-race, formal education is part of it. Graduating, only to expect for a safe job, is my biggest fear. While everyone safely walks towards the same direction, I will walk to the other direction, to the unknown, to the uncertainty. I believe that not every uncertainty, is a bad uncertainty. There must also be a great uncertainty that needs to be discovered, stepping out of the racetrack will be my first move after my graduation, this year.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRXfmPMV8555kF5w3VmBRdoMY44L15vfdcfeZVKSgEdjJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYeN2cBiMrWKMCvi9nB2NiGnfbk3MHy7mxWBWZGsLDnip", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRXfmPMV8555kF5w3VmBRdoMY44L15vfdcfeZVKSgEdjJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XZ3XWpsJYoRXX1jxJE6AJcxjYwLPoZocy"], "tags": ["Photography", "BlackandWhite", "Street", "Public", "People", "Life", "Dreams", "Hope", "Melbourne", "Australia", "Rat-Race", "Dull", "Graduation", "City", "Art", "Photographer"], "extra": {}}
