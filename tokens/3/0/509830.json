Looping tones are based on the viewer's tez address (be sure to sync). Drag the rectangles up, down, and sideways to change the loops. Each loop has three settings: delay, feedback, and distortion. Tap or slide the circles to change these settings. You can replace the notes with your own text by typing on your keyboard at any time. Tap outside the board to mute. Thank you HeN artists and collectors for these months of fun and more to come!
