{"__version": 1, "token_id": 461430, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Efigenia 2008-2021", "description": "Efigenia is a variant of Iphigenia. Iphigenia originates in Greek language and means \"born to be strong\". In Greek mythology, Iphigenia was a daughter of Agamemnon and she was to be sacrificed by him to Artemis, Greek goddess of the hunt, forests, hills and the moon. Before this happened, Iphigenia was magically transported to the city of Taurus. The story was an ispiration for many artists throughout history, the most famous piece of art probably being Iphigenia in Tauris, a drama by Euripides. As a feminine given name it is very rare in the United States.\n\n\nMM on 6 x 6\u201d Wood Digitized October 2021\n\nSound design by @fendelmarc 10/2021 Recorded and mixed in Seattle, WA\n\n\u2018Annemarie Grgich \u2013Archaeologies of the extraordinary Everday\u2019\nCurated by Professor Colin Rhodes, Dean, Sydney College of the Arts\n\nOpen 4 October 2009 \u2013 Jan 2010\nBorn in Portland, Oregon in 1961, Annemarie Grgich began making spontaneous art at the age of fifteen, mostly by clandestinely painting in her family\u2019s books, or making junk constructions. She first introduced collage into her work around 1988, but took it to a higher level in 1997 during a period of illness. When she had recovered, later that year she began to produce collage paintings \u2013 images of people encountered over time in the street and in mind journeys that manifest themselves and recombine, according to her mood, in the process of creation. Collage helps to effect an almost alchemical transformation in the works, through its function as sign, to its active involvement in the dialogue between paint, drawing and resin. Anne\u2019s works rarely include text, yet they are narrative-driven, reaching a kind of apogee in her magnificent handmade books, in which image and physicality combine as analogues of living experience. Though well-known in the USA, this will be Grgich\u2019s first solo exhibition in Australia.\n\nProfessor Colin Rhodes\nCallan Park Gallery\nSydney College of the Arts\nThe Visual Arts Faculty of the\nUniversity of Sydney\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CRLoka5lWaf/?utm_medium=copy_link\n\nhttps://annegrgich.com/grgichcdgcollaboration\n\nhttps://www.outsiderart.co.uk/artists/anne-grgich\n\nhttps://www.petulloartcollection.org/anne-grgich/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmas3xpca6Lq9kWtBm3RYJ8U6TYuLhJNRcHXXj1RDQF87K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNtV2S55DEb6G7ShJLoJ4AEUPpr2u8CPmuErpp1Rg2dVS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmas3xpca6Lq9kWtBm3RYJ8U6TYuLhJNRcHXXj1RDQF87K", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2WWBPDBAjfagGSTCnVL8ZPRXnU7LGgjPoT"], "tags": ["#love#hen#nftcommunity#cryptoart#tezos#nftartist#hicetnunc#nftcollectors#nftart#hicetnunc2000@onhicetnunc#nftdrop#crypto#cryptoartist#objkt#tez#1hen1#henp2p#nftcollector#outsiderart#annegrgich#annemariegrgich#rawvisionmagazine#museum@ammegrgich"], "extra": {}}
