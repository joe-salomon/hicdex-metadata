I always find water towers amazing; beyond their simple utility, they resemble spacecraft that have either just landed or are about to lift off into the heavens. The full moon, taken in Utah seems to be in alignment with the water tower. Hidden message?\n\nAbout the View Portal\nThe \u201cview portal\u201d that frames the image is a photograph of an industrial window in a renovated cookie factory. The window provides a gateway into fanciful realms where you can explore worlds familiar and unknown. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXMHyoVu6QLkxMrrnMWy4q1JFTB4yb1CipBBgjPCYYEZs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS4piphTQu2aUUoVkARxqFm7qbfsAMBHR37PJ9VsK3dnM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXMHyoVu6QLkxMrrnMWy4q1JFTB4yb1CipBBgjPCYYEZs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LyqA6KX1sLH2ZcCLTzEnSWiijY4NCiySQ"], "tags": ["NYC", "cityscape", "fullmoon", "portal"], "extra": {}}
