In my opinion one of the most important public statements for a fair and transparent public discussion. He\u2018s young, overly talented and has a functional immune system. He\u2018s also the 1% of the most influential persons in Germany, especially for the youngsters. They should see that one of the best players in the world has another opinion that doesn\u2019t fit into the narrative of the public health ministry. So they understand that not everybody who\u2019s isn\u2019t vaccinated is a right-wing fascist. That narrative is extremely strong in Germany cause of history and germans moral. Everybody cares a lot about how people think of you. Everybody is afraid of standing on the wrong side of history. Everybody wants to have an opinion on everything although in medicine and science there\u2019s never a 100% exact truth, it\u2019s always a process, still everybody rely on scientific data, although there no clear recommendations for young peop Don\u2019t forget about taking your vitD supplements during darker winter months. Everybody speaks about the vaccine, nobody about vitD - too less of a profit I guess le to get vaccinated. The truth is always inbetween, it\u2019s always about money and before covid I never felt that any government ever wanted me to be healthy. That\u2019s always been my job.\n#Kimmichunboosted #alphaKimmich", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYCVLe97nP7fWwPwoxTMvBvqZqpHY9vesqDd8XPrd9Q6D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUQVBUGPrFqFLH9eos7r4LEBkbk6FVKjwdZvEwCYo9vdd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYCVLe97nP7fWwPwoxTMvBvqZqpHY9vesqDd8XPrd9Q6D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ixNDGGVAfWGcvz8hBrrcpuW7vThvNTCtE"], "tags": ["filmphotography", "digitalphotography", "visualstorytelling", "2D", "3D"], "extra": {}}
