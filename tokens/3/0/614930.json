I went to Trabzon for an travel project. After we had our lunch, I saw that daisy in front of the restaurant and I took the photo. Thanks for reading my story :)\n\nI will give an airdrop for the collectors of my NFTs. \n\n\n2448x3264 px | 300 dpi | 3.1 MB \n\nYou may contact me through social media:\nIG: @mdoceans\nTw: @hi_cetinkaya", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbAL6C1qHvuSigi4QDFbZAFpWBuWpEYWLRj8bb2PmqtSs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX4zXgJu5YDoNtPTjKhykbFYZApV5ky1npZvrukSTKG8F", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmbAL6C1qHvuSigi4QDFbZAFpWBuWpEYWLRj8bb2PmqtSs"}], "creators": ["tz1XBHLVHEwWQXU2Zh5scT8QuBBQAMTSLHpH"], "tags": ["nftart", "photography", "photo", "nature", "daisy", "flower", "nature", "travel", "hen600k", "photez", "nftphoto", "mobilephotography", "iphone", "story", "genesis", "hicetnunc", "art", "artphoto", "image", "blossom", "white"], "extra": {}}
