You don't know me. With this open letter maybe you could possibly take a few seconds out of your busy life as a crime fighter, a playboy and a sociopathic loner, or a chummy guy with a partner who enjoys bantering and wearing brightly-colored tights.\n \nI don\u2019t really want to get into the whole \u201cRobin\u201d thing, but you must realize that Robin is a good boy. He's an obedient and dedicated person. He's an orphan wearing tights just like you. Robin just want to be appreciate and stand for what's right for him. Robin's have his own reason to against you. But you slap him in the face just because of a dissent. Why'd you being so dramatic? Why'd you treat him like a dick? even though his name is Dick, but why you can't accept an opinion? Why is it always about you? Or is it maybe you afraid to be abandoned by people you love (again)?\nIt's been years that the image of you slapping Robin became a meme. And I haven't heard you felt sorry for what you've done. That's not how you treat a sidekick? Pick someone your own size. Fuck you Batman.\nBtw, I know your who you really are. Your name is Bruce. Bruce Banner.
