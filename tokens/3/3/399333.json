During the creation of the painting, Lemoine wasn't able to submit her artwork to the famous art exhibition The Salon of Acad\u00e9mie Royale in Paris due to access limitations that the establishment had for women artists, though in later years she was finally able to show her works in the same exhibition in year 1796.\nPapaBear \u2014 Today at 6:36 PM", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSb7s1MsyqBr2AwERKgvxbVwEazDveZSorTiHhvNw3B5q", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdybax9Lb6YAHZMFqkFEZfQ93VQUn5McPhuze7iECZZj9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSb7s1MsyqBr2AwERKgvxbVwEazDveZSorTiHhvNw3B5q", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29inQoQzXtFCEx7sp8tWyCaUT5EqrexZ7o"], "tags": ["3D", "3Darts", "Characterdesign", "Papabear"], "extra": {}}
