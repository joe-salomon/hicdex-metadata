He walked to the end of the hallway and looked directly into the eyes of the kindly attendant watching him. He said \"GM\" and she nodding quickly in a tragic and anxious manner said \"GM SIR\". He said \"I need something to start the day if you know what I mean\". She looked at him with a smile: \"I have exactly what you need\". He sat down and waited, in just a few seconds she brought him a gigantic cup of coffee. Nothing you've seen before. A real cup of coffee generated by the best coffee cup trees on PNGVerse lands; Filled with the delicious brown liquid of the gods. After delivering it, she was already leaving, when he said: \"Wait a minute, wait a minute\". She looked at him startled. He looked seriously into his cup, lifted it and smelled the coffee... He put it in his mouth and took the first sip smiling. He turned to her and said: \" You know, this is, excuse me, a Damn fine cup of coffe!\" From that moment on he never left PNGVerse.\n\n1250 x 1250 - PNG", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfLmjdLjJ7g3rRpTK45noAE8Fi1gkbcEe1uD7EopVJ8jM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdgzwwWfUwHaxszsPUVxjDxV5DGyqdwrdzG2fuPGVN3jT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfLmjdLjJ7g3rRpTK45noAE8Fi1gkbcEe1uD7EopVJ8jM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iTMgaQuUHGSDanJDJLZzH4LpG4At6qb2J"], "tags": ["coffee", "gm", "twinpeaks", "dalecooper", "tp", "davidlynch", "fakepng", "pngverse", "png", "joke", "meme", "storytelling", "story", "universe"], "extra": {}}
