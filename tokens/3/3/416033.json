To compose this piece, I created a 3D art and added reactive effects to the sound, making the music as soundscape to the visual 'pixelscape' generated.\n\nNavi Straelin is a reference to a distant galaxy, where divine beings contemplate the non-existence of materiality, free from any physical limitations, expressing the psychedelia of their souls in abstract forms that drag and connect through time.\n\nThe EP is available on streaming platforms. Contact us to request usage.\nListen using headphones or two stereo speakers for better experience.\nMP4 - 640 x 480 30 FPS\nStereo 48kHz 24 bits", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme5vPFiynJq8venQZo2o8f6UyEMnKDFhqpWfi6bHR3c93", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWMnZ1QwuQvHDtFgygzjYmHJS3a1vhATi9KHurFP346K8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme5vPFiynJq8venQZo2o8f6UyEMnKDFhqpWfi6bHR3c93", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Tp8PHdx2KsvHyVWb4NaGev8wXLk1HwqCw"], "tags": ["soundreactive", "3D", "ambientmusic", "generativeart", "collection", "orchestral", "pixelscape"], "extra": {}}
