I dreamed of this place before..\n\nthe winds come to me like a whisper somewhat it called my name. after that mysterious event every time i come to the shrine I picked Omikuji (fortunes paper) i always got Golden Luck. it's a spiritual journey for me. and after that I always felt lucky, even I had a bad day. i know a good time will come.\n\nI made this a token of my gratitude to all collectors. I hope this brings you all good fortune as I had before. \n\nthank you, Arigatou gozaimashita", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbWCUCHu2tXL1VCvAS4WLTWbHrrXRCrdgaHv23c7wjT3m", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbWCUCHu2tXL1VCvAS4WLTWbHrrXRCrdgaHv23c7wjT3m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmbWCUCHu2tXL1VCvAS4WLTWbHrrXRCrdgaHv23c7wjT3m", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbWCUCHu2tXL1VCvAS4WLTWbHrrXRCrdgaHv23c7wjT3m", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2XHrDqeyAhyimtMKQrx4QmacN71oMfYQdz"], "tags": ["manekinekko", "pixelart", "gif", "japan", "pixel", "16bit", "cat"], "extra": {}}
