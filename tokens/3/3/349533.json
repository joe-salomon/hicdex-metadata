This generative artwork was released as a limited edition mint [1/5] on Hic Et Nunc by Kenny Vaden. This piece recursively generated and successively plotted smaller versions of the same function, with 6000 lines that each pointed toward the origin from random points. Scaled versions of each line were generated at 25% to 75% size and nested for two levels. The results were 16 versions of each line, which became successively smaller as they approach the origin. Height was used controlled the gradient color selection, although approximately 1/4 of the lines were drawn black. The image dimensions for this file are 30x15 inches and resolution is 300 DPI, which produced a file size below the limit, which provides a higher resolution (more detail) than the original version shown online.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWbTGUcnSNGFBuAyZSKRSWjzDJb9baWLm3SLk7fwvP1VA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWd9C59Zqs9dLMokQ7Qn4vaQbaZb4roCmmTyburPYYV8f", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWbTGUcnSNGFBuAyZSKRSWjzDJb9baWLm3SLk7fwvP1VA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bEHdSDNdTTPmuin84c6LWqruepu6a5sc5"], "tags": ["Lines", "GenerativeArt", "RCode"], "extra": {}}
