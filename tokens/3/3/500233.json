Would you have a question about it? Even a wild imagination in your head?\n\nI have seen it one time, one shoe lying on the bus stop at night. It feels weird. How could someone leave their shoes?\n\nQuestions and imaginations that arise are always about the owner of the shoe, what caused him to leave his shoe. Maybe he was in a hurry, for some reason. But it doesn't make sense. How could someone take off their shoes at the bus stop? Or he could have left his shoes due to the pranks of his friends who played having fun on him, and he ended up upset. The wildest thing I could think of is maybe someone has kidnaped him.\n\nIt is so interesting to see how wild my mind would get the images from seeing only one shoe lying, especially in a public place", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUfXWmBTvDag8PT3BsSxLLc1NdPEnbZMMMX6XsX9P29Ho", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdWcj1bNF8n8HHGGsvtTuDNRpip23MytVh9PiF8tPJMZU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUfXWmBTvDag8PT3BsSxLLc1NdPEnbZMMMX6XsX9P29Ho", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hzAsBJzifph6288TAmwSZsW94pgK8fWAz"], "tags": ["HEN500K", "Drawing", "Watercolor", "Shoes", "Illustration", "NewBalance"], "extra": {}}
