The reproduction is a beautiful object of the early twentieth century and is therefore in fact an antique find in itself. A find that represents an older find, which in turn represents the timeless icon of classic femininity. The head was scanned with a photogrammetry device, then processed in a 3D environment and remapped with new imaginative, lush, and colorful textures, all deriving from my original freehand or digital drawings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUeyk5ENJtBxwYZkaWBo6zD79X6Q1xZ9nAFvCScowZDit", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcWSAaGnLs5khZPnuoqpmpxt7pEa3SK3VHSj8CYqBN4Df", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUeyk5ENJtBxwYZkaWBo6zD79X6Q1xZ9nAFvCScowZDit", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1amsgMaX2kYNLHMttB26Rf1EXmy5eJAwZG"], "tags": ["3Dart", "VR", "VirtualReality", "turnable3D", "3Dobject", "3Dscan", "Venus", "Beauty", "Sculpture"], "extra": {}}
