On the other hand, I have chosen to give it a cheap price so that those who could not buy pieces for 1XTZ, can buy one now :)\n\nI decided to mint 10 editions for every work (6), and to give them a 50% cheaper price than the original pieces from the collection. \n\nThis special edition is made to give a closure to this SHIVER collection. Hoping to resume this style (someday) with new ideas!\n\nThank you very much for all your support. I will have to think of new ways to surprise you! Love You!\n\nMUCHAS GRACIAS!!\n\n\nMatur\u00edn, Venezuela.
