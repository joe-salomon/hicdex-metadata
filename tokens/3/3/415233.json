Once the true shape has been revealed, it will stick to that shape forever. The shape is determined by the wallet-address of the first collector.\n\nEvery Noise-Neon is a unique OBJKT (Edition of 1) and therefore a true NFT.\n\nNoise-Neons is a project by @TeNinEightNFTs\nFor more information about Noise-Neons visit noiseneons.tenineight.xyz\n\nThis OBJKT uses the hicdex API and therefore depends on it. This is all experimental and might break in the future.
