My dream was to go to the West Tatra Mountains alone. After 3 a.m., at the beginning of September, I set off from the shelter on Polana Chocho\u0142owska towards Wo\u0142owiec. Several hours of climbing in absolute darkness was a new and strange feeling for me. I was both excited and slightly anxious. Above me I could see the starry sky, which is impossible to observe in urban surroundings. The stars were bright and clear, and even larger star clusters were discernible. I had an overwhelming urge to stare at the sky longer, but I had an ambitious goal\u2026 sunrise. As I emerged above the forest line, a colourful glow of light appeared in the sky. The sun was about to appear closer to the horizon line.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWcuSTRuLsvCq4byr3osPfz59NWbJ6G4hiF2ndLxBHDcP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcXKxgFRmCdqErAXnqeWngYe4XGupNc23obC81dMP6CiQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWcuSTRuLsvCq4byr3osPfz59NWbJ6G4hiF2ndLxBHDcP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QGnFHUB1NX7mBvBDg85CMUrpXPWKLg4aW"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "colors", "saturation", "light", "beauty", "camera", "grass", "sun", "mountains", "Tatras", "sky"], "extra": {}}
