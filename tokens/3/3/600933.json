It is the seventh song from the debut album, State. \n\nThe work and animations featured in the State series represents the rebirth as an artist and is the culmination of five years of work. \n\nThe album and animated series allowed a sense of liberation to create and make the Bases project what it is today. This work serves as the foundation. This is the seventh animation in the series and it will not be minted elsewhere. \n\nMusic by Darryl Kirchner, Marco Salvaggio\nArtwork and Animation by Darryl Kirchner", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPRQQnnu9dPBBhPWWvzPzqx1C5Ybt98xq5VEmfY2sbyVS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXTsB1van749Y6e4D8T8pnxsPXcEeFHyiUCHHikwqP6rh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXTsB1van749Y6e4D8T8pnxsPXcEeFHyiUCHHikwqP6rh", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPRQQnnu9dPBBhPWWvzPzqx1C5Ybt98xq5VEmfY2sbyVS", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1g9wxVbu5EKBeSqeGFoKSBnPKvxJnpKcsw"], "tags": ["animation", "music", "illustration", "glitch", "funk", "geometric", "nostalgia"], "extra": {}}
