In 2020, American rapper Cardi B.'s song \"W.A.P.\" (Wet Ass Pussy) featuring rapper Megan Thee Stallion, was somewhat of a cultural phenomenon. The lyrics were so shockingly sexually explicit, that it caused a controversy between freedom of speech and social/religious conservatives in the country during the pandemic. The words you see are my absolute favorite from the song, that highlight the absolute ridiculousness of both side's arguments. PUNANI (a slang term for a vagina) DASANI (an American brand of bottled water from Coke-Cola), imply that her vaginal fluids are so good they ought to be bottled and enjoyed. It's hilarious, vulgar, and absolutely within the bounds of free speech. My advice to social/religious conservatives is if you don't like it, don't listen to it. Why is it ok for their side to say what they want about the culture/morality/etc, but when that free speech doesn't suit their wants and needs, it needs to be out of the realm of free speech and should be banned. You can't have your cake and eat it too you big babies.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT1YUgWJwVcWXXBwVf5sBLfFbNJgeoYEkzkxCH6xtW2GA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcL8H7Xaaxzgnj67Sxpyb2G5GHJ9s2oimyavTawnHJ2hv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT1YUgWJwVcWXXBwVf5sBLfFbNJgeoYEkzkxCH6xtW2GA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
