This work was inspired by an early morning drive on a cold winter's morning. I remember opening the door to my car and sitting in it like normal and then I happened to look down at the gear shifter in the middle of the car. The light brilliantly illuminated the letters P R N D. P for Park, R for Reverse, N for Neutral, and D for Drive. Almost immediately the two words (PRETEND & PARANOID) came to mind that surrounded these letters. I don't know how and I don't know why. At this point in my life I just accept these moments as gifts and say thank you. I'm just grateful for the opportunity to be able to see these gems in the wild.
