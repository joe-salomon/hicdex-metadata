So that they can grasp it better, they create some form, perhaps the form of a god or a symbol, or a code, so they have something they can relate to. They then use that code or that symbol in future ceremonies to contact that intangible energy once again. This is the role that Mikaelim plays in magic, while the music and dance that may be present in such a ceremony is the role that Auritmo might play, providing the raw energy to reach the higher levels of consciousness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVGgjKhhTxu6isNFg6A3tkXvzc1kd1AUswZrnSYWtsKr3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYWHh9g2DGwtTV3Cq7yqWWML1g45KvbrMLSooaVY8qQdg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVGgjKhhTxu6isNFg6A3tkXvzc1kd1AUswZrnSYWtsKr3", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UFGoq1zNy3RAJPqEYh2ibRcy4bkkfu3CG"], "tags": ["angel", "codex", "analog", "mixedmedia", "cryptonoise", "angelus", "commander", "mikaelim"], "extra": {}}
