On a woodland walk a family came across this mask whilst playing around an old Yew tree, the dog was the first to spot it, barking. After inspecting the spot they caught a glimpse of a face within some foliage and moss in a crevice within the trunk. As they picked the mask up they realised they had come across a mask of the fabled Green Man. This was no ordinary mask, as with all the other legendary masks, this one too had a life of it's own. It is believed that the family were too spooked by it's otherworldly life that they left it where they found it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQsBySHymDi4WhohFZPcHrDgW5p4iyGPrPVTzBfhCkq2q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXihkoiv1f9UJLHRSSzjEGdRomQ3Zpz9mkGKMCZ8nVSQu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQsBySHymDi4WhohFZPcHrDgW5p4iyGPrPVTzBfhCkq2q", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hb6YNsTVceJJPMgVYsPhEd6i4mwVLbjjZ"], "tags": ["GreenMan", "animation", "death", "mask", "deathimself", "2d", "art", "series", "MaskSeries", "DeathMasks"], "extra": {}}
