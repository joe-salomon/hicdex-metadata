During my work on SPACER COLONIES and OUTSKIRTS, I got fascinated by the relationship and evolution between input patterns/textures and the AI-imagined output. \n\nFUSION combines different techniques to explore that relationship, but is essencially letting a gan imagine over various input patterns/textures. In some works, visualisations of that relationship are integrated in the piece itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWGoAY9T9tTH72Ty2P4zFiq9ijqJ3qWKqfECro8eDc5ur", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWGoAY9T9tTH72Ty2P4zFiq9ijqJ3qWKqfECro8eDc5ur", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWGoAY9T9tTH72Ty2P4zFiq9ijqJ3qWKqfECro8eDc5ur", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1M5pswUdqFNoMH3NAtF2W9GCwdLx1ZiWUV"], "tags": ["ai", "generative", "artificialintelligence", "gan", "abstract", "texture", "experimental", "animation"], "extra": {}}
