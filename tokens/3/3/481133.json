The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: I\u2019m the subject of a documentary on film. The crew have set up several cameras close together. They\u2019re filming me. Since I\u2019m small and fragile, it\u2019s easy to be hurt or destroyed. I try to move and speak, but my speech is slurred, my teeth are broken. A medic appears. I tell her what they\u2019ve done, that I\u2019m the subject of a bad documentary. She\u2019s very kind, understanding.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 102 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVZxpgXSGAocJGQTUaa2mVTWG2F2sTgNoy8L7zJ2rnYup", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUUKdUzKrcu8vWnbkuxjrrzpQAAM5HJVW2ayrZyiwxWmi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVZxpgXSGAocJGQTUaa2mVTWG2F2sTgNoy8L7zJ2rnYup", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
