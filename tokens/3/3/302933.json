The Romans worshipped the character Mithra who was born of a virgin on December 25, was crucified and resurrected three days later, in the name of God so that others could live.\n\nMithra is not the only one either.  Worshipped figures through several different religions, all previous to Christianity, have followed this exact same example.  It goes all the way through to the oldest religion; Hinduism and Astrotheology.\n\nThe common people of Roman understood that Mithra was not a human who existed but rather he was an allegory for the sun, God's sun.  All previous religions are based on Astrology.\n\nChristianity replaced the sun with God's son, a white man with light brown hair.\n\nThe Pope's clothes are drenched in sun symbology. Have you noticed?\n\nWe are participating in a Solar Cult whether we like it or not, whether we know it or not and all the while being distracted from Astrotheology itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiar3fxlwuz2jviq5y7zvuvllq5xfrtanb3u7ztk4linlgia45sf4q", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiclp3lntl2rsmht2cleefjkzqfg4ieeylabnow5yas6zdkfc6cife", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiar3fxlwuz2jviq5y7zvuvllq5xfrtanb3u7ztk4linlgia45sf4q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2KX99C271j1EgHFpR8B4SbdjmK8rcQnGa4"], "tags": ["painting", "abstract", "skull", "horns", "religion", "truth", "visualessay", "vicpark"], "extra": {}}
