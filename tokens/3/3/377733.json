Something new and so beautiful that I feel it. \nI make work that is generated form the previous piece. \nI\u2019ve started to incorporate elements that extend out of the picture plane as a way of symbolising relationships to sources of influence outside of art, abstraction and NFT. \nThese extensions lead the way to what I learn and incorporate into my life. \nI like to think the artistry lies in what I create from the knowledge I accumulate. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWec6Nn2ShDSZUsDrVWzdvYqwDWETK1fjnDiRugHtRkeS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdPsnLgyP3AtY3GiQQbGt8b4Kwo8UZtNcYuc76NFaE9m1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWec6Nn2ShDSZUsDrVWzdvYqwDWETK1fjnDiRugHtRkeS", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NHP2mmBNbagWLLnaKM3C1QCtmuk2Qjg26"], "tags": ["abstrktobjkt", "abstract", "fineart", "nongenerative", "digitalart", "colour"], "extra": {}}
