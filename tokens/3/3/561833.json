It try to explore unseen levels of resolution and topological complexity in architecture by developing compositional strategies based on a purely algorithmic processes.\n\nIn the Skizo\u00efd project, I use these algorithms to create a form that appears at once synthetic and organic. The design process strikes a delicate balance between the expected and the unexpected, between control and relinquishment. The algorithms are deterministic as they do not incorporate randomness, but the results are not necessarily entirely foreseeable.\n\nThe resulting architecture does not lend itself to visual reductionism. Rather, the processes can devise truly surprising topographies and topologies that go beyond what one could have traditionally conceived. Skizo\u00efd is between chaos and order, both natu-ral and artificial. Any references to nature or existing styles are not integrated into the design process, but are evoked only as associations in the eye of the beholder.\n\nMore information can be viewed here: putteneersjoris.xyz/projects/Skizoid/skizoid.html", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVeQHPNHVRp3tDqW9RP3BcwQLBvC6SfchabwcC6MM3V1d", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUZAtM2tY3c6rvK3Dq3SxY4RwHTc7sPngLXFbpw4zwbHg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXrKyM7PMkujko34xKXvEfedL1HLeVj7ASVdFzVEu8WaE", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVeQHPNHVRp3tDqW9RP3BcwQLBvC6SfchabwcC6MM3V1d", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fSL9BdNNG5ZxGDF92qvwqN23rCuYRiWRn"], "tags": ["synesthesia", "artificial", "synthetic", "architecture", "procedural", "jorisputteneers", "organic"], "extra": {}}
