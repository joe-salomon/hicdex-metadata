{"__version": 1, "token_id": 420333, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Unbreakable Kheftan / Immortal inspired shield", "description": "Magnificent shield that can go with any immortal weapon. a relic inspired by an undying legion serving a kingdom lost to the ages. Probably existed in an alternate reality where apes ruled over the earth.\n\nImmortals were highly trained soldiers with great numbers, if any soldier was slain during battle, another one would be ready to take that soldier's place, hence they were named immortals.\n\nWrapped with reinforced leather. Two holes are on both sides for poking with spear safely behind the shield. The boss (front part) of the shield can shatter any bone with a shield bash, notice the 2 guards on it forming a crest with a familiar symbol on it (oh boy). The symbol and several other gems on the shield are made of \"Firooze\". The shield is surprisingly light weight compared to it's high stability. \n\nThe cow head carvings on the shield represent an old tale from the past, a man who stood against a great evil with a cow shaped mace. Beetle carvings point out the stability, a symbol from an enemy territory. Odd scorpion tales represent the use of this shield with an immortal spear. Ape guard carvings on the shield shows the numbers of the legion and how they cooperate, as if there's another comrade on right and left covering you from all sides showing the undying immortals power!\n\n2K Rendered 60FPS", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeTvGFrcLvmAWW9d9cdZ5tFtT7VAi6t2dMHPkmkTAHY4Y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUMytuyuoKGwFCAgZLQBquuxdAT6GzhZ2WwvDLF8SbqUW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeTvGFrcLvmAWW9d9cdZ5tFtT7VAi6t2dMHPkmkTAHY4Y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MdXDde4Lrzb5RyEfVP3kDNsfqtRnEeMn9"], "tags": ["shield", "animation", "3d", "3dart", "2K", "history"], "extra": {}}
