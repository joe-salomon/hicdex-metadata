Loreng made contact with a group of people who call themself \u201cReactor\u201d. We are intrigued by the name of it, because we think of very dangerous and powerful energy from Earth, nuclear energy. We sent our Santuari\u2019s representative \u201cFirefly\u201d to collect some for a sample, but what we saw and witnessed is more dangerous than nuclear itself. It is a raw power that wreaks havoc on the floor, the energy that flows through the thin air and resonates with all the people of your kind, yes, sonic energy, the sounds of the underground, and the spirits of ultimate freedom.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfW8joDAUgtnpmWs5sCvazUAt7BU7QkRepNb4EcS5Gsih", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmatP9CQ6m53rAUwnyQHXnYhLuVH7C9BapeHMjXG9WFVgX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfW8joDAUgtnpmWs5sCvazUAt7BU7QkRepNb4EcS5Gsih", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bdfs8hh17RYPZpTUxKGsFuM9Xhu2GRvnR"], "tags": ["SantuariStudio", "Loreng", "CryptoArtWeekAsia", "CAWA", "Asia", "Indonesia"], "extra": {}}
