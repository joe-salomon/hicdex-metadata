As a member of the Labour Party Kinnock was known as a left-winger and gained prominence for his attacks on Margaret Thatcher's handling of the Falklands War in 1982, although it was in fact this conflict which saw support for the Conservative government increase, and contribute to its landslide re-election the following year.\n\nKinnock supported the aim of the strike \u2013 which he dubbed the \"case for coal\" \u2013 but, as an MP from a mining area, was bitterly critical of the tactics employed. When heckled at a Labour Party rally for referring to the killing of David Wilkie as \"an outrage\", Kinnock lost his temper and accused the hecklers of \"living like parasites off the struggle of the miners\" and implied that Scargill had lied to the striking miners", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUwYZp2NyW8Ei2W2Apksk3f4RGqMhpUbSAQy8k62sT6zd", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma85hbFCL8APiRRQ59xSxK7zaykEiGTqvLWY3HhUpGq7e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUwYZp2NyW8Ei2W2Apksk3f4RGqMhpUbSAQy8k62sT6zd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e3TV8PBSQ2EsZdaZjiEsrmXnfQCL7xrTX"], "tags": ["neil", "kinnock"], "extra": {}}
