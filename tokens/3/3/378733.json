Loss of self-confidence gives us the freedom to become a true explorer of life. The vestiges of conceit and the habit of looking down on people are left behind, and we take a step forward and want to look at other people with a fresh look. Emotions are enriched by the experience of making connections, the ability to relax and experience pleasure, feelings of certainty and love.\n Quote by Marilyn W. Atkinson\n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2019, spray paint on canvas, 80x80cm. 2893x2890 pix\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbqFt1p8EedQfrXjHGavdhFsa6YntHjG94v8oXxdA7uXo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQKernZh2VoytmWSc1NJVEACMZ3VTqCWvBoCbNHSBN9UD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbqFt1p8EedQfrXjHGavdhFsa6YntHjG94v8oXxdA7uXo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["denysenko_art", "artist", "colorful", "abstraction", "cleannft", "painting", "spraypaint", "maksymdenysenko"], "extra": {}}
