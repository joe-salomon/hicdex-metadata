She does not know, because the monsters don't know they are monsters, they are just being themself. Freya stayed in this space for too long, and took the liking of being among the little monsters, she liked how the little creatures lived and how the monsters thrived in this place. She felt outside to begin with, but then she started to speak with them, they were not that different.... Slowly Freya started to change color and developed new eyes. The monsters have little eyes of their own, special eyes, eyes that sees things others don't. Only one(1) edition available!
