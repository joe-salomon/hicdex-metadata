What you also see is how the words stretch out as if they were connected by glue. I've always imagined these works to be as if we're down at the Planck Length (A length that can be defined from three fundamental physical constants: the speed of light, the Planck constant, and the gravitational constant.) or in laymen terms, the smallest unit of theoretical quantum measurement of the universe. Think about the smallest thing you could possibly conjure up in your mind and the Planck Length is way, way, way, way, way smaller. Like a hydrogen atom is about 10 trillion Planck lengths across. Let that sink in...crazy right? So now we're conceptually at this length and imagine these words and then you see an anagram of that word connecting the letters. I always imagine I'm here playing with these words as if they're bending particle fields and pulled by resistance. I promise you I'm not crazy and/or delusional. This is how my mind works; I can't help it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfWSbn8dYUVNxEVed5w1teyqr5cWZZsJw7hwRzbYJj84c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWmLBdeRUMXhvWYhTKrmqsTt1VM1KXPf8TrY5XzNnoFH6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfWSbn8dYUVNxEVed5w1teyqr5cWZZsJw7hwRzbYJj84c", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
