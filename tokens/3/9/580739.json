It is used as a sign that the story told through the Wayang performance has philosophical meaning and life lessons. The tall and pointed top symbolises man's life. The tall sprawling tree wants man to realise that all their action needs to grow and be dynamic. Birds symbolise how man needs to create beauty in the world, both physically and spiritually. A building symbolise how a country needs to be safe peaceful for all who lives in them.\n\nThis moving image is a wish for safety to those affected by Mount Semeru eruption that happened on Dec 4, 2021.\n\nThis work is part of a charity to help victims of the natural disaster from Mount Semeru eruption, every sale in the first market will be 100% donated to the victims, through sewon NFT", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdyRaw9Y65z77N5XpawWhPSR3tppV4PPtYUYxXVtva1Hm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWcChLGts5UKiq4FUU74bCTuf9GAXCC72RctLyuD4GQKD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdyRaw9Y65z77N5XpawWhPSR3tppV4PPtYUYxXVtva1Hm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FQ9ciqi533mVrG8w1CvFP3xTKTE7jZGeV"], "tags": ["tezos4semeru", "sewonnft", "batik", "gunungan", "mountain", "meditation", "motiongraphics", "animated", "sound", "tibetanbell", "indonesia", "wayang"], "extra": {}}
