Cheifetz\n\n\u201cI would like to remark on my wife's patience and clutch performance for this painting. On short notice, after finally getting a toddler and an infant to bed, she came down to the studio to participate in a 500-photo bubble gum blowing marathon. And so this painting was born. On some rare occasions a painting will flow from inception to completion with an ease and joy which surprises me, and this was one such painting. How and why does this happen? Some kind of magic. There is real magic and power and beauty all around me, and it does me good to be reminded of this. I need to open my eyes and take notice: My wife, who\u2014among other things\u2014directly made this painting possible and who created our children. My daughter, a beacon of joy, whose birth literally coincided with and perhaps precipitated the birth of my Flrrbl creatures. My son, a force of determination, 3 months old at the time of this painting. I live with the fae.\u201d -excerpt from David Cheifetz : Figure (Paintings 2009-2017) p.16", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVd5Pq596t9F9RQwieHb4KeoyYEVwASa4Upwqwj1AWppe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdLKAAVLUYG7JtiZjCkSjaEYuyhB9dzxK6Lbsac9ujQFz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVd5Pq596t9F9RQwieHb4KeoyYEVwASa4Upwqwj1AWppe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SRhv2Nrj31bXXCW9vo8LbA9PzbRk2LcK9"], "tags": ["PAINTING", "OILPAINTING", "FINEART", "PORTRAITPAINTING", "FIGURATIVEPAINTING", "FIGUREPAINTING", "FLRRBL", "FLRRBLZ", "CHEIFETZ", "DAVIDCHEIFETZ"], "extra": {}}
