It is on the album Broke n Love Tunes by sandyMOUNTAIN 2020 featuring louis burdett on drums.\n\nI have known louis for many years but always thought he was too good for my simple rock style. On this latest album though I was trying to just make a simple album without the fuss. Louis said yes and I couldn't believe how much it was exactly that. NO FUSS We did ten songs about an hours music in 1 hour and fifteen. It was like one take strait through I would give louis a bit of a idea of the song for 8 bars then he would count in 2 3 4 not even loosing the beat and it just felt amazing all the way through till the end.\n\n\nLouis Burdett\nProfile:\nAustralian percussionist & drummer.\nAliases:\nBruce Burdett, Lucien Boiteaux\nIn Groups:\nEd Kuepper & The Yard Goes On Forever, Free Kata, NUDE (26), Paris Green (3), Power Point, Serge Ermoll's Free Kata, The Raries, The Royal Australian Navy Band\nVariations:\nViewing All | Louis Burdett\nBurdett, Lewis Burdett, Louis Burdette, Lucien Boiteaux\n\n\nsandyMOUNTAIN\n\nbest releases\n\nTOKIN EVERYTHING 2015\n\nBroke n love tunes 2020\n\nBeautiful Day 2016\n\nHenrys holiday 1998\n\n\nguitarist in DeciBell Cat  \nAlbum HYSTEREO 2020\n\n\nALBUM boring by vainglory 1992\nalt punk band\n\nall Albums are on nrke.net", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNLxQrt3eBVXntF6y7kY4TpUmfJoW4AAvNttH5RZFVQT5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbQau5Z7RJdeVoEowmUvKXzK1tEpJGLpBi9RdszE51iW8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNLxQrt3eBVXntF6y7kY4TpUmfJoW4AAvNttH5RZFVQT5", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cEL52puKP9YLgmjW7qFhEkaqRzWzd3MzZ"], "tags": ["sandyMOUNTAIN", "louisBURDETT", "brokeNlovetunes", "Itsnotallitscrackeduptobe"], "extra": {}}
