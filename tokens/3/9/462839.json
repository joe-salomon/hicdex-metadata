You will face new challenges, but these too shall pass if you do this: you must follow The Chariot because The Chariot will clearly lead the way to success.\n\nLook! There is a young man standing on his chariot. His chariot is pulled by two horses, one of the steeds be green and the other blue. He can still control these two horses even though they are moving in opposite directions. He is wearing a crown with laurel wreath and eight-pointed star, which represents hope and victory. He is holding a wand (spear) in his hand that shows his authority but the wand is blue so it also represents his emotional side. He is wearing a coat that had magic power in it to protect him. There is a river flowing behind him, but he is not scared to cross any obstacle.\n\nThe Chariot is the seventh card in the Major Arcana. Seven is the number of spiritual awakenings, inner growth, introspection, wisdom, and intuitiveness.\n\n*This item is available only as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).
