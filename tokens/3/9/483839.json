Part 1 in a series of 4. \n\nRoom of Sand is an abstract photography project which gives form to the spaces at the edges of our perception. Spaces which, while fleeting and immaterial, are ever-present all around us. The insides of your eyelids. The first sun of spring upon your face. The cold shock of a swim in the sea.  \n\nEach photograph is the byproduct of a unique 'space generator', a physical model which produces novel spatial conditions, recorded with a camera. \n\nEach piece captures one of these liminal spaces forever, so you can return to them again and again.
