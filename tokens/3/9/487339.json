Once I started experimenting with the tape warp, I knew the possibilities could be endless to make it look different.  This dollface collection are the coolest moments I created & then had even more fun with in after effects.  \n\nThe score is a fun little ditty I made one afternoon-- once I started warping the playback time, I realized how many different dimensions/environments/feelings I could create from the progression.\n\nInspired by 50s/60s make up, Kenneth Anger, David Lynch, John Waters & Divine, the last ones left at a downtown dive bar, musky old Hollywood bikini bars filled with ghosts.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX8Fw4BPz48Vygj83kaqr4LTQMYTwu2LASJ921Kbr9nRq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNmpbHgxYdwfhVv7KP4EqsoRrCPDAWxYkmPebf5xNxfhL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX8Fw4BPz48Vygj83kaqr4LTQMYTwu2LASJ921Kbr9nRq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2AeW9LBeEZWXMrT5FMqH96tUq3kPxK3BPn"], "tags": ["vhs", "videoart", "vaporwave", "music", "experimentalvideo", "retro", "grunge", "dreampop", "color", "colorful", "glitch", "vcr"], "extra": {}}
