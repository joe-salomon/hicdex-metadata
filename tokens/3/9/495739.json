A metaverse like no other.\n\nThe second replaced reality. All consciousness, the last shred of soul, were all converted into bits. \n\nThe third wave saw the collapse.

Bits and pieces of meta-reality.\n\n// loopymoon // 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaPPG27UqVRY6EaSCPYis9NEerLAWFdPaTXpnBGwk3bvu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUxn4Bc1Hfi15TkoAC75JRJCAE8X1jMh917KKBmZaXoes", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaPPG27UqVRY6EaSCPYis9NEerLAWFdPaTXpnBGwk3bvu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iiMWaRHGLTqawxnSMBYZmJ2byCBUBS3Vr"], "tags": ["gan", "loopyverse", "consciousness", "monochrome", "onchain", "metaverse", "singularity", "metareality"], "extra": {}}
