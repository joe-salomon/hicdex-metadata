{"__version": 1, "token_id": 339039, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Polar Rose #001", "description": "The polar rose is a famous mathematical curve that looks like a flower with petals. It can be defined by a simple equation in polar coordinates: for an arbitrary constant (including 0). If is an integer, then this equation will define a rose with petals for odd ones, or with petals for even ones. If is rational but not whole, the graph given by the equation forms a rose-like shape, but the petals will overlap. If - irrational, then the rose consists of an infinite number of partially overlapping petals.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQj2akgjkcQjBczfb7duLXW9Ezvjw66Q3SLd74aSTA6Sv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQj2akgjkcQjBczfb7duLXW9Ezvjw66Q3SLd74aSTA6Sv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQj2akgjkcQjBczfb7duLXW9Ezvjw66Q3SLd74aSTA6Sv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NZjejCE3zRzY9ht6L2wPChgvhqbBHPXLb"], "tags": ["rose", "polar", "math", "black", "white", "geometry", "curve", "mathematics", "rhodonea", "sinusoid", "sin", "cos"], "extra": {}}
