Annnnnnd goes right for the sexual innuendo stuff. Real mature Andrew...real mature.) I'm glad to switch gears like that. When you hear the word BALONEY, do you really hear that word or do you hear BELOW ME or BLOW ME? What if you said all three in a sentence as you read them top to bottom. Makes for an interesting conversation with someone you love. Homophones are some of the wildest aspects of the English language. Folks, I don't make this stuff up. These are real words, just put into a certain context. (Great Andrew...where's the art here?) Ugh...you guys and all the questions. Imagine going to a jewelry store and looking for a diamond ring, the sales person didn't make the ring, the owner of the store didn't make the ring, the diamond cutter didn't MAKE the stone; he/she/they cut it into a specific size and shape and set it into a ring. Guess who just made himself pedantically into a diamond cutter? THIS GUY ------> (That's supposed to be pointing to me.) Ughhhh...my mother would be kvelling if I was a diamond cutter, instead she gets an artist that uses words as the art.
