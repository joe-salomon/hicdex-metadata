This is #1 of 3 images.\nAlways seen as a sunny and blue sky, Salvador melts in the rain. When it rains in a sunny city - and it rains a lot, what is blue turns white, grey, milky. This city of oil dissolves in water. It's dissolving. The root city is the cloud city. The city in which white is taken takes blue lightly.\nJPG 4664x3109px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYZ9ssrDheQ4QAnmRtheMZdnnxxLTqtMythFEqtXCuFHc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZPwjYKMqrzYfvsxbwhJK2boqMvmkWHveXd79D6nPNf7H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYZ9ssrDheQ4QAnmRtheMZdnnxxLTqtMythFEqtXCuFHc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TshhgGPKeu5C5SXQMTbHMvmvTq17zxxGC"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "brazil", "art", "rain", "landscape", "triptych"], "extra": {}}
