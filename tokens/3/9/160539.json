During this era of civil unrest and anti-war protests in Austin, the Ku Klux Klan received permission to march in a pro-Vietnam war demonstration. They were received by a largely peaceful but quite loud opposing group of citizens and students during this moment in history. This photo shows the Klan members (men and women) making their way toward the steps of the Capitol. The Austin policeman on the left is doing his best to avoid contact with the group while still doing his job to keep order. Taken with a Praktica FX2 camera on 35mm Kodachrome film.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXb4dqzctZAPw8uifqFZZMmBPPtjB3A2dvrQvweaqisca", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZzXpqKWQDG4YhcMEMJ3cCMKeiFq2nqv1M25xADswFHMF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXb4dqzctZAPw8uifqFZZMmBPPtjB3A2dvrQvweaqisca", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YmwJZfEerVMbc8uuJc7xUzE64ma3Xfu7L"], "tags": ["KKK", "Klan", "Clan", "history", "protest", "Vietnam", "Austin", "Texas", "series", "peace", "60\u2019s", "civilrights", "anti-war", "city", "1965", "march", "black", "lives", "matter", "blm", "white", "supremacy", "security", ""], "extra": {}}
