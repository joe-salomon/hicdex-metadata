The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\u2028\n~~~\nIn my dream: Two wars are being fought. In Vietnam \na convention will be held to end the war. On my way to the convention I\u2019m hit by a mortar and nearly die. A doctor at the field hospital where I\u2019m being treated administers a small explosive charge to at least two men who are bleeding to death. The disease transforms them into unarmed meat\u2014vomiting and throwing up. I\u2019m of the mind that this is OK, that\u2019s how the disease is. Other men turn away from the dead and dying, as if confronted by a ...\u2028\n\u2028~~~\n\u2028\nThe GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\u2028\nHumans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines.
