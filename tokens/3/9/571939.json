The entire collection is in fact a book, a poem, a manifesto. And every image is in fact one verse from the poem, one page from the manifesto. Furthermore, the entire text is generated by an AI algorithm trained on the Writings in The Cloud, as archived by the Keepers of Our Collective Consciousness. The results: a human-machine cocreation meditation on consciousness, free will, art, life, death, technology, ritual, ecology, economy, sustainability, and salvation.\n\nThese are the audio-visual readings of the corresponding Verses.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQg8YC6K4jbDm2kg95ziEYD1PSoqRTcvXPEcfckDnXamS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdEZkMxhBemdi1iiC6j3fE4ZoAaLwjXfVWMQmrPVPgWWX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQg8YC6K4jbDm2kg95ziEYD1PSoqRTcvXPEcfckDnXamS", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Z518hXWJcXaghZLbFrgYdu1jiehGZVS9U"], "tags": ["nfts", "nft", "digitalart", "art", "cryptoart", "artist", "raredigitalart", "ethereum", "artoftheday", "cryptoartist", "blockchain", "contemporaryart", "nftcollector", "animation", "modernart", "artcollector", "arte", "artoftheday", "ethereum", "crypto", "bitcoin", "artgallery", "design", "digitalillustration", "nftsstories", "crypto", "digitaldrawing", "artgallery", "digitalcollectibles", "artwork", "bhfyp", "digitalillustration", ""], "extra": {}}
