I have walked through dust and I have seen the pits. I have seen the cinders and the black cinders. But thirties, forties, I was in the know: the air is full of powder ever since the rising.

But I have seen the light, I have seen the way, I have seen the end. And it's the same now: the end will come again like the plague, and then only the end will come again when I reach the ragged shore.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb52WtzUKfgzzCHH9bZrgm4XQHSTyFgAyVEDVBYXGKro8", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb52WtzUKfgzzCHH9bZrgm4XQHSTyFgAyVEDVBYXGKro8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb52WtzUKfgzzCHH9bZrgm4XQHSTyFgAyVEDVBYXGKro8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hSvbx7wLyH36wx2aDziTFyWybTYBmMbbE"], "tags": ["fantasy", "illustration", "sci-fi", "post-apocalyptic", "gan", "neural"], "extra": {}}
