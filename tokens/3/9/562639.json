{"__version": 1, "token_id": 562639, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "NO PEOPLE TO SEE. KNOW PEOPLE TO SEE.", "description": "During the lockdown of the pandemic, one sentence kept coming back over and over for some reason to me and on this day I decided to listen to it and think it through. The sentence was: NO PEOPLE TO SEE. I kept saying it over and over again, as if to explore the phonetical and audio qualities of the sentence. What wound up happening was discovering a complete homophone version of the entire sentence. From the original sentence, I began to think about the homophone of NO, which is KNOW. Let's switch the words now and see what we get: KNOW PEOPLE TO SEE. You can see now that both sentences sound exactly the same, but when you read the first sentence, it comes off as a general declarative sentence that there are no people in the area or just in general to physically see. Now the second sentence has a different connotation altogether. It has more of a prophetic tone to it; an almost mystical declaration that to truly see and perceive truth, you need to know people and understand relationships.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW4hLbrbnzPyxRg4FtkGcyR2a6MM7DhWy8xz7ADMpXcdH", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme9H3SazLN8hceP5f3H79ks82MbBJvih4CsSqVHrrX1uZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW4hLbrbnzPyxRg4FtkGcyR2a6MM7DhWy8xz7ADMpXcdH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
