Completely self-taught, and on the cover story of RawVision Magazine (#22), she became known for her one-of-a-kind books filled with page after page of impassioned, expressionistic faces and figures. Grgich often employs collage and vigorously applies layer after layer of over-painting, covering found texts and images, yet allowing some of the underneath to remain visible. This layering suggests generations of mystery and mystique to her exotic characters.\"-PhilDemise-Smith, Gallery A Studio\n\nDigitized in 2021 in Tacoma, WA @annegrgich\nSound design by @fendelmarc recorded & mixed in Seattle, WA 10/2021\n\nGrgich Products: https://www.redbubble.com/people/annemariegrgich/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWaFLmhKHJwvPrEU7Mif6awvQiLHuzCVaRfjGeCgFcPB2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSjDkyo3K4tTZ3MTWHmrsFN8oKAytMSH1Dv64xPaWxkf2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWaFLmhKHJwvPrEU7Mif6awvQiLHuzCVaRfjGeCgFcPB2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2WWBPDBAjfagGSTCnVL8ZPRXnU7LGgjPoT"], "tags": ["#mmpainting#collage#animation#ambient#love#hen#nftcommunity#cryptoart#tezos#nftartist#hicetnunc#nftcollectors#nftart#hicetnunc2000@onhicetnunc#nftdrop#crypto#cryptoartist#objkt#annegrgichtez#nftcollector#outsiderart#annegrgich#annemariegrgich#rawvisionmagazine#museum@annegrgich"], "extra": {}}
