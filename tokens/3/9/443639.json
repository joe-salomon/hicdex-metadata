The Second Sex, published in French, presents a feminist existentialism that prescribes a moral revolution. As an existentialist, de Beauvoir believed that existence preceded essence and therefore one is not born a woman, one becomes. His analysis focuses on the Hegelian concept of the \"Other\". It is the social construction of women as the quintessence of the \"Others\" that de Beauvoir identifies as fundamental to the oppression of women. The capital 'O' in \"others\" indicates \"all others\". De Beauvoir argued that women are just as capable of choosing as men and that they can therefore choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond \"immanence\", which they were previously resigned to, to achieve \"transcendence\", a position in which an individual takes responsibility for himself and the world, where his freedom is chosen.\n\nDigital Watercolor Vector Illustration made in Adobe Photoshop, 1200x1200px, 200dpi, JPEG, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQvcW2FCHkWoqu38KBLE4iASdvM4Vpt1Zw2KjDSMajr6p", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWZmeyXsS1vCvky1uw1GoxCM9fSMBDjwFSFotAMPYmQfr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQvcW2FCHkWoqu38KBLE4iASdvM4Vpt1Zw2KjDSMajr6p", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KfkkjyoJ4amMbZmTh3trxvHK7yFMKFJwL"], "tags": ["modernidade", "collectible", "hicetnunc", "maxuga", "socrates", "sartre", "humanism", "spirals", "existentialism", "inspiration", "philosophy", "jpeg", "digitalpainting", "vector", "collection", "beuavoir", ""], "extra": {}}
