That charger in the Aztec culture and societies of the time, an essential link in the city's markets.\n\nThere goes the hit! There goes the hit! Ring and rent the aisles of different markets in the city. They are the famous diableros or carretilleros who try to break through the crowd. Without these unique freight carriers, the markets would lose a very important part of their commercial dynamics; the speed of the diableros depends on the transfer of many products.\n\nIf you wonder why they are called diableros, it is because of the horn-shaped handles that the wheelbarrows - devils - have that they use to transport merchandise. Each diablero can load up to 600 kilos on his little devil. The same merchants say that the load record is held by a diablero who managed to load a ton of 200 kilograms of merchandise.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4t6TNbzrRDRzKwWmdHBbWQRJ1VMYqn7K5W3sGAdC6h8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRKknQ9C9fTfdxgWH23bddVv2Peh2Fwz2KvWufDYJErqe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd4t6TNbzrRDRzKwWmdHBbWQRJ1VMYqn7K5W3sGAdC6h8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4Q8g7vx5EXGysLkWridBqnbjJXikMYSu"], "tags": ["diablero", "market", "city", "street", "photography", "man", ""], "extra": {}}
