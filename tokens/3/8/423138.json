That the children distrust all authority and have more and more courage to act against fascism.\n\nLet us take responsibility for our freedom (individual and collective)\n\nLet us be curious and addicted to express ourselves poetically and creatively .\n\nEven if this planet is broken, polluted, burned, filthy, it can be rebuilt in the same way psychedelic mushrooms grow in manure.\n\nLuc\u00ed A Guerra, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZPz6XTqr4ZWqo8rTVFzNQirFLU3QmAjqqN2dEUZJyrY2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYiw9w838QS7p24DpUXQADAfYKkQtCdjp4kAg6RrFRqyy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZPz6XTqr4ZWqo8rTVFzNQirFLU3QmAjqqN2dEUZJyrY2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LpSupdqLgfFo8gEafWfmi8SQjSrPTqXmc"], "tags": ["collage", "analogcollage"], "extra": {}}
