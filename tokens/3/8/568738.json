Whilst he\u2019s not the most prominent figure in the Realist Revival Movement he\u2019s certainly the most active. Namkia is said to have coined the slogan, \u201cSay No to Normal\u201d, which has become a central tenet of Dahasa philosophy.\nMost people are familiar with his avatar but his actual identity and appearance are hotly debated. Since he first appeared on the scene, a variety of\ncelebrated philosophers, politicians, religious figures, and entertainers have been accused of being behind Namkia Nam. However, no conclusive proof has ever been presented to support any of those claims.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaD19abRKJU2TjT7gic3nqA4FE9BnGaeMNMoAf7gfiqqG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfMuwreF2ogGKkU9fNDRJZmAsdF7e7wUR6tKBZzwS7hvs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaD19abRKJU2TjT7gic3nqA4FE9BnGaeMNMoAf7gfiqqG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QgkEnqqsRDcrC6W77SPvjCgzPFNGfNweB"], "tags": ["veilofthegods", "graphicnovelart", "scififantasy", "cyberpunk", "character"], "extra": {}}
