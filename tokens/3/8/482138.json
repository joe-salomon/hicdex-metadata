When the teachers notice, they would tell me to stop doodling and to focus. I don't blame them, but I wasn't interested in any of the subjects besides art. The only teacher that saw my passion for art was my Japanese teacher, Ms Hiroko.\n\nOn our last class together, she pulled me aside and handed me a copy of Katsuhiro Otomo's manga anthology. Inside, she wrote, 'I hope this inspires your drawing and Japanese'.\n\nI don't think she knows just how much that day has changed my life. Wherever you are, thank you, Hiroko.\n\n\"I will write peace on your wings and you will fly all over the world.\" -Sadako Sasaki", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUG9D5WxQvND2ripjJ5nPmZB7t1o2b1vqHUZxWcq6Gges", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYnCaktzX3ZsX4LVPEm7bELYFukyLmA4P8fvq7Bnu5ADc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUG9D5WxQvND2ripjJ5nPmZB7t1o2b1vqHUZxWcq6Gges", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hkE6Jf2pzu9Kmdbgew7fKi1EqvuR1hAVw"], "tags": ["Dynamic", "rare", "digital", "digitalart", "video", "women", "fantasy", "colored", "2D", "collectibles", "beautiful"], "extra": {}}
