Following years of diplomatic friction and skirmishes between Israel and its neighbors, Israel Defense Forces launched preemptive air strikes that crippled the air forces of Egypt and its allies. Israel then staged a successful ground offensive and seized the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. The brief war ended with a U.N.-brokered ceasefire, but it significantly altered the map of the Mideast and gave rise to lingering geopolitical friction. \n\nMobilized by the threat to Israel\u2019s existence during the Six-Day War, Washington D.C. Jews raised a record $3 million for Israel. After an announcement that Egypt had accepted a cease-fire, many local Jews joined a victory celebration at Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House. This is a photo taken by Chip Walker depicting the Jewish demonstrations in response to the ceasefire.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTyVmbFuVSUPQqhVtTXiF6CzxvsRCKTr9HQQLH2w49KgT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVmgRXpep9vG4DfASTr3DgvMgqgyVKbX5PSNmHGzckMiD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTyVmbFuVSUPQqhVtTXiF6CzxvsRCKTr9HQQLH2w49KgT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LZcjbkKtb4WDnVGSptA6oEhUZM7yKsaC4"], "tags": ["bnw", "blackandwhite", "fineart", "photography", "historic", "documentary", "sixdaywar", "israel", "junewar", "chipwalker", ""], "extra": {}}
