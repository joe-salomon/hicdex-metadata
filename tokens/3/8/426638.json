I didn\u2019t know anything about weed at that time.\n\nAnd so this random guy comes up to me and says \u201cdo you want some weed? Give me a 20!\u201d.\n\nI was like \u201cok man! SCORE! Let\u2019s do this!\u201d\n\nThe dude went down the street and turner right on the corner. After 10 minutes he came back with a pretty big cube of weed. \n\nWe were so happy about it, we celebrated!\nWe got our paper, a lighter and another round of beer, got out the bar and went a little further that street. As we opened the plastic bag, we realized\n\nIt was a cube of wood.
