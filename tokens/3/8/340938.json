I have many more photos to share from this place and this is one of my favorites. It wasn\u2019t open, so we just poked around outside for a bit looking at their old mining bits and pieces. This mission used to sit at the center of Indian Town, the segregated neighborhood built by the mine owners where Native American mining staff lived with their families. The town was eventually razed after the mine closed, and all that remains are concrete pads that the houses were built on, dilapidated basketball courts, and this building.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ9k53tJ2PebM2QBQr68Krq6ZXFH5jseqBi8eYo3uzGad", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWhHnHWegeiBDgwWHAoZhVva98oSjNnGo8JEyAB8KsRdZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ9k53tJ2PebM2QBQr68Krq6ZXFH5jseqBi8eYo3uzGad", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LmgYjTWi6ymb7GTSFJrnhmebGTBYqzofS"], "tags": ["Ajo", "church", "mission", "Arizona", "history", "travel"], "extra": {}}
