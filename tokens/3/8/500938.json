Even when still, our hearts beat and our blood pumps. We can lay our heads to rest at night and put pause to everything, but, the earth we call home will continue to shoot through space. Spinning around a giant burning ball of plasma.\n\nAll things are moving; all things are transforming.\nWe break down and build up again. Our cells become phoenixes living through a cycle of death and rebirth. In a decade your body as it is now will be completely replaced. Moving through time as time moves through us. In this, we become less of what we were, and more of what we will be.\n\nWhat will we be when that star swallows us whole?\nWhat will we be when tomorrow is today?\n\n(digital painting: created 2021; 2953 x 3543 px)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVBbb4C2cqG8QQLCo123bfUxCEwbkNiTwzE7LFSftvY6J", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ8FBtyfghizC3rponCK1p2pftMR4oc55ySYZRZxn4mLg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVBbb4C2cqG8QQLCo123bfUxCEwbkNiTwzE7LFSftvY6J", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UmYUVpouuCUdgkMnjTYHn8wjoLKrdSs1E"], "tags": ["portrait", "figurative", "abstract", "colorful", "introvoid", "yellow", "digital", "digitalpainting", "man", "transformation", "jpeg"], "extra": {}}
