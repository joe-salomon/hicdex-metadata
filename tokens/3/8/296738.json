Unlike you, I have no face, so I tied up thousands of pictures of masks in order to create one. I put on seminal processes just to found out that I am disfigured, grotesque, and repugnant to my existence.\"\n\nThis series of my first work is created through Generative Adversarial Network or GAN. I put in 1000 pictures of mask and create a million string of new pictures. This work will be minted every Tezos cycle and with the help of a simple algorithm, only the selected one will formed an appearance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifsh2zae5rgib5tzkyz33em2kusfcdhqqa223jifspvrdtdztk6fy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigiuogh4vajnaf6uaizzpikbut23p2vivbh5vyfpmtlgc5wfv3fnq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifsh2zae5rgib5tzkyz33em2kusfcdhqqa223jifspvrdtdztk6fy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XxSwkFUkgt3zmzEcFLnnNc6zkdU4zPXqa"], "tags": ["surreal", "computerart", "internetart", "digitalart", "GAN"], "extra": {}}
