The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\u2028\n~~~\n\u2028In my dream: I\u2019ve just won the lottery. I\u2019m walking down the street, hoping someone will look for me. High on the blackness hanging in the air, like snags in a fog, I see a glimmer of light. A scraping noise approaches. Is it me? Am I snoring? A men\u2019s chafing suit is coming right over my head. I ward it off. Then a new man, a trainer, will judo-grab me. I see this man anywhere from ten to fifteen feet away. I see him successfully move me around. I see him grab me. I say, \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t seen that before.\u201d\n\u2028~~~\n\u2028\nThe GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\u2028\nHumans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 10 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028\n[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPd7npKPbmVdftBVqu1UD7g3sAAdYJCeUHF44gtqS5CU4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWEVSjUp7Sx7Chb8B1985hwwZXjCYXokPgyUshxUE5jf2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPd7npKPbmVdftBVqu1UD7g3sAAdYJCeUHF44gtqS5CU4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
