It's beautiful, untouched for aeons. When a solar flare from the star in it's center hit the worlds with such power, the trees started to wither and die from the inside. 296 was admiring this from a far as it happened but saw that the flare would leave nothing of the universe. It interfered the flare and took the care of the universe. Now their travels are calm and green once again. With the flares effect always just about to happen.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdY4HFA5XVDfttFXKSSTVAPaZubAbW1UhLGvCkAskAKuh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW6LirFppcG3MFktSrmxvpSRH3STn2zxDVcrS6UUs7oRW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmRgJeibrxXud92zChUvBz6ir61sqKos5pqRV7xhTEHnED", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdY4HFA5XVDfttFXKSSTVAPaZubAbW1UhLGvCkAskAKuh", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dFdr2eUt9hCRn9F2CQrFNt4rJubuAittQ"], "tags": ["fractalfaces"], "extra": {}}
