Isn't it weird? It is as if God hates exactly the same people you do. If you think you did it for God, let's be honest. No, you did not. Believing that the voice you hear in your head is the \"infallible\" voice of God is how serial killers come to be. Do you also say \"I prayed about it\" as an excuse to keep holding on to your hate? You \"prayed\" about it, to reinforce your own personal beliefs, and attributed them to God. It is time to take responsibility for your actions. You are not a prophet. You are not having prophetic visions. Psychologically, you might be a victim of a socially acceptable delusion.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQCWuqWjq7EkTasm6MrTbqaRH3m5qztz7q1PdVtDRqpB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdKqrH4TgMEHygVWqexHwcs493tRmtaUmuDhXSb57Q7iQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQCWuqWjq7EkTasm6MrTbqaRH3m5qztz7q1PdVtDRqpB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rw2JoU2AK2TNdfhcd4h918CdTGSNh5Gnw"], "tags": ["spilledink", "extremism", "socialcommentary"], "extra": {}}
