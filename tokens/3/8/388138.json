Your surroundings appear something hostile yet desolated. Very soon you start to familiarize with this new picture, to recognize it as yours. it's hard to accept it, but nothing around you has truly changed, what you see is only an echo of yourself.\nIn 2016-2017 I went through a serious mental state from which I thankfully recovered, I had a taste for deep desolation, dread, and loneliness. Pulling from this experience I want this artwork to give a voice to the voiceless doubts and fears that plague an individual's mind battling through dark times for the first time.\n\n\n\nConfusion, longing, fear, self-doubt, and finally, relieve. For there is not just doom and gloom in one\u2019s life; deep meaning can be found even in the mist of the storm.\nAs soon as I understood the concept and historical importance of NTFs, I decided that I would only ever mint artwork with deep-rooted significance to me, I want collectors to not just have a pretty animation to look at, but a piece of my heart too.\n\nThis is my genesis piece and my story.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdJjNmVjkuRofZUyx4Y6jjbBRNe3Up7baHefnhRuQrFtD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZTpwPRzMhNrXJ5RTzaJFZp1R7mCNqEnof6fK6L3bXpQZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdJjNmVjkuRofZUyx4Y6jjbBRNe3Up7baHefnhRuQrFtD", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PywT3GRx9c9Bm83P1QmGqQnQkkiawNhWS"], "tags": ["digital", "surreal", "post-apocalyptic", "otherwordly", "looped", "experimental", "dark", "postapocalyptic", "gloomy", "horror"], "extra": {}}
