Raised from an early age under the rigorous BSD-3K code.\nIt is located on the gloomy planet Kamorgis, famous for its continued resistance to the rule of the Galactic Union. It is precisely for this reason that this planet was designated to carry out missions. Her determination and discipline is unbreakable.\nNow she is on the trail of a fearsome guerrilla group called Kriznars who, according to recent clues, have a young orphan girl with extraordinary power captive in their ranks. Her objective is to rescue her and bring her to safety, before the guerrillas find the way to use her as a weapon or something worst.\n\nSoundtrack By Gabriel Romero @OpacityLow", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdUS2Aq7PMntxxhkN1wPwtrwVr4z4DxVZH9w1XhK5Ekfo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTXCRCnYkvJYm9MTb5gQyYrZwboNqbCXj27WnDA5TakGs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdUS2Aq7PMntxxhkN1wPwtrwVr4z4DxVZH9w1XhK5Ekfo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bF1c2dZPqtapqP4iCxitkrRfcjZnEiKzw"], "tags": ["animation", "love", "character", "saga", "future", "space", "lonelyhearts", "collection", ""], "extra": {}}
