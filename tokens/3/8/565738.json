The movement is credited with bringing feminist ideas into practice in an industrial dispute and empowering women to take a public role in a community with a male-dominated sphere.[1]\n\nTheir group and support work grew from the communal feeding of families in April and May 1984 to a more explicitly political role. A multitude of local support groups were set up early on in the year-long strike.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYmPNFVPAQZGxmjyheQgaBQrkKXHamJ2agKHs84YzkgTz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPGF7pSzyeHDEk6iGyMZvGK4ZaQ9zLR96TSAguU5MXMVL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmdq4VrEVtGKhtxPzPocFdEaz3AAks4H3HMUaSHRc47XnZ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYmPNFVPAQZGxmjyheQgaBQrkKXHamJ2agKHs84YzkgTz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e3TV8PBSQ2EsZdaZjiEsrmXnfQCL7xrTX"], "tags": ["niners", "strike", "1984", "1985", "uk", "women", "pit", "closure"], "extra": {}}
