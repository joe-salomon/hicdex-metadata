Find everything that is that color in your house and take a picture.\u201d (Original post in my story)\n\nI loved the idea and brought it to my partner, who responded with what I\u2019d been thinking, \u201cWhy not do all of the colors of the rainbow?\u201d So we wrote down all the colors on slips of paper, threw them in a hat, and picked our first color. It was blue. Our second was red.\n\nWe set up two different shoots out in our garage, gathering up every crimson, rosy, brick, burgundy, scarlet, ruby, bloody-colored items in our belongings and displayed most of them for this photo. \n\nPart of an ongoing series exploring all of the stuff we collect color by color, through the rainbow. \n\nPictured: yours truly and my lovely partner", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVmjcHbhmdPiar8KbguCcnc9VbnfptRYYZM5JqFLfBiBs", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma4eAuy3zJ2Yb66nALnUV8terZ5mHmbh2USmakvguhQrd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVmjcHbhmdPiar8KbguCcnc9VbnfptRYYZM5JqFLfBiBs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LmgYjTWi6ymb7GTSFJrnhmebGTBYqzofS"], "tags": ["colorgame", "quarantineactivities", "red", "photography", "monochrome", "sanguine", ""], "extra": {}}
