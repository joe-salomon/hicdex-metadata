Who is this person holding me? Why are they about to cut this cord attached to my body?\n\nWhy is the sky so different? Sometimes it\u2019s dark and I can\u2019t see at all, and sometimes the blue makes me smile. And other times water falls from above and I get all wet and cold. One time I saw flashes of light and loud noises and was so scared.\n\nWhy is this girl making fun of me and trying to throw dirt at me while giggling with a beautiful smile on her face.\n\nShe just turned back at me in class and smiled, what does that mean? What should I do?\n\nWhy am I learning these traditionalist values that have no use-case in our modern world?\n\nWhy do I have to answer questions that I don\u2019t even really know on these questionnaires?\n\nSexuality? How do I even figure that one out if I can\u2019t openly discuss my thoughts comfortably.\n\nWhat really is a marriage? A traditionalist idea that\u2019s boxed us into a certain way of thinking for far too long? And why does it have to be so important.\n\nIs that really what I have to do? Find someone to live a life of complacency with?\n\nHow do I end this feeling of hatred for denying myself the comfort of exploring my curiosities?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s mental, I just need to find a way to unblock the guilts and denials in my psyche.\n\nUnlocking a box full of patterns taken that went against your honest thoughts is quite the task.\n\nI feel the risk is worth taking, finally.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXmsMfAyiMZPP3oubsmddaYTPsKs6cxThpKo3eiw4VG7h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcTc6Hq7YUoywoaBFvGUYZYpddRmnz87jFmv94JU7YEL6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmXmsMfAyiMZPP3oubsmddaYTPsKs6cxThpKo3eiw4VG7h"}], "creators": ["tz1LiKcgzMA8E75vHtrr3wLk5Sx7r3GyMDNe"], "tags": ["spokenword", "spoken", "word", "visualpoetry", "poetry", "openness", "curiosity"], "extra": {}}
