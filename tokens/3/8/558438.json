This image represents nature in its purest, raw form of beauty. This pinnacle of vibrancy, commonly referred to as \u201cthe peak\", is one I\u2019ve been chasing ever since the day I picked up a camera. It\u2019s challenging to time just right, for all it takes is one storm to wipe away the leaves and leave you waiting for the next year to come. Isn\u2019t that the beauty of the chase? The anticipation building up to the grand finale, yet always at the mercy of Mother Nature herself. Just as predictable as each season is to come, you can count on the canvas being wiped clean and the process to start once again. For as fleeting of a moment as it proves to be, its beauty is undeniable to behold. I've been coming to Yosemite National Park for decades of my life, first as a child and later as a photographer. This is the best I've ever seen it. A still river, dramatic reflections, and colors that still mesmerize me to this day. This was a special one, that always reminds me of how beautiful our planet is.
