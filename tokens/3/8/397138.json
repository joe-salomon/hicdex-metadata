He also fought against many apostates and enemies of Zartosht to do so. In return, Zartosht gave Esfandiyar a chain and armor from Heaven. The armor made him invincible and the chain had the power to bind anyone, even a demon or evil magician, making them unable to escape. Zartosht also gave a Divine blessing to the prince and declared that anyone who would spill the blood of Esfandiyar (killed him) shall suffer a cursed life of bad omens until the day he dies and even after death would be condemned to hell.\n\n\n\n-", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY4VpKMDrBTXT5mp5zHPLHopLvJizfCKqns6dXfgLvMNL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXLMhurerTNhmTurFnX98z1EyesyDYJ93XWv3fS4MkKNL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY4VpKMDrBTXT5mp5zHPLHopLvJizfCKqns6dXfgLvMNL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["digital", "golden", "paint", "esfandyar", "shahnameh", "zartosht", "golden", "nice", "2dart", "character", "design", "kolko", "colors", "green", "blue", "blood", "cute", "savageviolent", "day", "price", "generative", "art", "COLORFUL", "evil", "cursed", "character", "minimal", "coloful", "yellow"], "extra": {}}
