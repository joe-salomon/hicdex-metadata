A painter that hadn't touched a brush for 6 years, a man who was touching the bottom in his life for reasons he couldn't control, and who ultimately tried to rebuild himself through the only way left that he could think of : Art. \nTwelve monoliths are the milestones of those months devoted to building a body of artworks from scratch, to building a community from noone. \nTwelve monoliths emerge from the grass, for the grass was the simplistic algorithm of the beginnings.\nWhat a year it's been for generative art ! The digital distortion pattern is there to emphasize that. \n\nHeart Shape is there to celebrate this life-changing year 2021 and to tell you how much I owe you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Lushtemples \u2014 Heart Shaped\n\u2014 Generative drawing\n\u2014 Made with original Javascript code\n\u2014 Format JPG\n\u2014 Resolution 6300x8910\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc46UADXXGKYnpB6z3zVK7rQaykdr2mfT4SdQF4uSb1Fk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPUqcY8RQkSk2asTjt7EdMjfLwBd94zCJVSdQfXnp8R3p", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc46UADXXGKYnpB6z3zVK7rQaykdr2mfT4SdQF4uSb1Fk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gBXG9fg8RMDH69KfKqwoTH5sFDmzt5yzm"], "tags": ["Lushtemples", "Generative", "JPG"], "extra": {}}
