It was a science experiment that was supposed to let us touch water and turn it into ice. A touchy process involving cooling water to the perfect temperature just near freezing, and then touching the same water with a wet, room temperature finger to the chilled water. It was supposed to create a magical effect. It unfortunately didn\u2019t work. I had my lights and camera set up ready to capture the moment we turned the water to ice, and while it didn\u2019t work, I still had my lights set up. That\u2019s where this photograph came from, and where I began creating a piece of artwork that is truly awesome.
