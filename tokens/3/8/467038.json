This one is a little bit of a stretch as, dammit, really isn't a word per se, as much as it is slang. Technically, it should be \"damn it\", but I'll allow it because...well...I like it. I normally stick by the rules of grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc., but sometimes I feel frisky and live on the edge. This doesn't happen often so relish in the abstraction from minimalist abstraction of semantic truth.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYwCWDDWzezzadZvvRApFaiqp1yJbFCFxQW9cVZtvv1EY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVFV3MkTZXmSrCRtyUSf86Da6w5kca9jvF8SQd9TDQ3bt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYwCWDDWzezzadZvvRApFaiqp1yJbFCFxQW9cVZtvv1EY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
