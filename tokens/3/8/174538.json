Yes! this piece is meant only for serious elite collector BOSS / god damn NFT cartel godfather who owns it all and have absolutely no fvcks to give.

One will (always) be the highest priced OBJKT in my \u2560\u2563\u2550\u2554\u2557 collection, the other one will be kept off the market until the first one is collected, and then; the second edition will be unlocked & given to someone that is noting else but a chill, modest, humble, simple, random loving person who does his thing without any fvcks given about what others think about him/her/\u221e.
