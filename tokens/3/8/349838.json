Noise is taken from circular motion on a 2D noise field with its own radius and offset. These values are mapped onto a range of colours according to one of seven different algorithms, and rotation is added to produce interference patterns with a choice from eight rendering modes.\nThe initial seed for this loop of 240 frames is 859793, which selects function 1 with offset (-80.0, -2.0), range (6.0, -6.0), and function 3 with offset (-12.0, -70.0), range (0.0, -5.0). Noise is produced from sampling points on an ellipse at co-ordinates (60.0, 22.0) with diameters (3.0, 3.0). The three formulae are combined using algorithm 5 with hue values starting at 346 with range 172. The grid is 113 units square.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW1pnBzK69pojKopPUCocPcY9SfeYZLYk1RuRtKj4nS39", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW1pnBzK69pojKopPUCocPcY9SfeYZLYk1RuRtKj4nS39", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW1pnBzK69pojKopPUCocPcY9SfeYZLYk1RuRtKj4nS39", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VjCS2jiBTVPSEoYzJ79KkbYV5QbFJxuf3"], "tags": ["xisal", "noise", "loop", "processing", "grid", "859793"], "extra": {}}
