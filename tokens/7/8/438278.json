{"__version": 1, "token_id": 438278, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "METAMORFOSIS", "description": "Processes derived from changes experienced this year, related to the person I was at that time, and spiritual changes that perhaps at that time I had not so assimilated. It seemed curious to me how I find that person and how it is reflected in the composition of each work, the emotional charge that each element has depending on the moment the work was made, how that \"METAMORFOSIS\" can be seen today, and how that Tito is seen in each work. I allow myself to write all this in this work, because for some reason I gave it that name at that moment and each work has a bit of that, it is like an energy that wants to express itself and depending on the occasion, what I do is different and is established in a different way. This work was perhaps what it meant to me at that moment, a point of transformation for my artistic persona and for the things I produce until now, a transfer of elements that somehow tries to appear in each work and gives it meaning. Occasionally I will break down these concepts further.\n\n\nJanuary \u200e 26 \u200e \u200e2021.\n\n\n\nTw:@tit0puyo\n\nCanvas:7998x5919\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeyYFHX3PwTpWrpDmbJoGohvBBEqF5JG34TYRaZZuirVY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPS2nAtGBN2Y3bHgdFD24wMcpg3PpfNSVgPdNFa83QHRr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeyYFHX3PwTpWrpDmbJoGohvBBEqF5JG34TYRaZZuirVY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CiiKavwoX6suve9YanvrfKJaz8FfjsKRR"], "tags": ["titopuyo", "digitalpaint", "dream", "psychedelic", "metamorfosis"], "extra": {}}
