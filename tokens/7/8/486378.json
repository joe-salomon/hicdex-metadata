In the United States it is common in Hawaii and in the southeastern states, where it has apparently been introduced. It features a central column that is topped by an array of short, doubled tentacles. The central portion of the crown is initially covered with a foul-smelling brown spore slime that attracts flies and other insects, who then disperse the mushroom's spores elsewhere.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTuqmAuAd7KjzAoEtPBfwB7r3EsiFZYQaE7Y5iGGiBAnc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTuqmAuAd7KjzAoEtPBfwB7r3EsiFZYQaE7Y5iGGiBAnc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTuqmAuAd7KjzAoEtPBfwB7r3EsiFZYQaE7Y5iGGiBAnc", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushrooms", "fungi", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
