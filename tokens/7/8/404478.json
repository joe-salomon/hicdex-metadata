{"__version": 1, "token_id": 404478, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNFOLDINGS - Cartesian Grid Transform 03 -> 05 / DARK", "description": "Back-and-forth transformation between two lattices, each obtained through graph algebra operations from basic primitives (path graphs) with node removal. Lattice is transformed using the minimal number of operations (adding and removing nodes) to produce the result. Simulation is based on Fruchterman and Reingold's method for force-directed placement of nodes which includes both attraction (between nodes connected with edges) as well as repulsion (between all nodes). This piece was produced as an experiment in computational design research on lattice algebras.\n\n@lukapiskorec, mp4, 1000 x 1000 pix, 600 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPgRRWWdBvFfTN9RRPD1hHZXeCocsvN4855tw8RNDapuG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYe4Ba3MindqpnRNq6D6LTG1H9EBA54ThUX39Asx16XgJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPgRRWWdBvFfTN9RRPD1hHZXeCocsvN4855tw8RNDapuG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Lkgy2gYECvVK55yyiwjbSSZeUoQp8Azxo"], "tags": ["lattice", "sculpture", "procedural", "generative", "algorithmic", "computational", "animation", "3D", "structure", "organic", "crystal", "geometric", "abstract", "architectural", "design", "graph", "matrix", "algebra", "unfoldings", "unfoldingsdark"], "extra": {}}
