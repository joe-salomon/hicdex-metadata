The analogue creatures were later transformed into the digital world and could be experienced with an Oculus headset.\n\nSound Hutch Demouilpied", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc7iUEzyidwnwAhZwsz7ueNhXA4QNv8oStaDvAidBdvCM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcmK3c1dU2xyqNur3GLiFuymW91xKsiRG5z2uHC3VwxW3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc7iUEzyidwnwAhZwsz7ueNhXA4QNv8oStaDvAidBdvCM", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hYBZGymM52REtwaDfb9Cy3GzzZbsyY7si"], "tags": ["Winter", "forest", "Taiku", "origami", "oracle", "fairytale", "unity", "minotaur", "creature", "story"], "extra": {}}
