The sounds of the women bustling through Market Street was only something one could appreciate if you were present. \n\nThe aromatic and fragrant spices stained their finger tips and tinged the air like the smell of a lingering meal that you don't want to end.\n\nThe children ran between the stalls and those that hung from their mothers backs, giggled gleefully as they watched their siblings and friends dance and play.\n\nEverything you could ever need was on Market St. \n\nIt wasn't the physical purchases that made it so special. It was the vibration of all those who frequented there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRcobJFu1Y5JgzTsa6ELeQeK7jmdHVe28e4BWAgnCtUsU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNnzD1pHbhAXk2wcVyiobMvbu4HQcDEyocNHmNSb1bQS9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRcobJFu1Y5JgzTsa6ELeQeK7jmdHVe28e4BWAgnCtUsU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UXPeDzfhtXfSFT796Zby3VKWfmTC5pavU"], "tags": ["AI", "vqgan", "story", "culture", "prose"], "extra": {}}
