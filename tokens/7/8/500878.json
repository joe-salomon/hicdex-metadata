Instead of waiting for radio signals or scanning alien atmospheres, we could look to distant asteroid fields for evidence. Advanced civilizations would have numerous reasons to probe asteroids for materials. They are rich in resources and easier to manipulate because of their lower gravity. Spotting chemical anomalies or infrared waste heat around distant asteroid fields could lead us to the ultimate discovery. || 2560x1440, 26s.
