And I wanted to mint NFT on Hic&Nunc.\n\nYou can listen it for free. And if you liked the song, you can support my art by buying this NFT.\n\nI will surely plan free content, in the future, for every owner of my music NFTs. \n\nThat's what NFT's about, isn't it ?!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU1wYCvyGa1Y7Fyf4bKUs8GumQLQbCoMQfZi96sthe194", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYEf63DsPV8r3oTikLzPrLnWzfhvYYV51GnCUV9SgUZYR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU1wYCvyGa1Y7Fyf4bKUs8GumQLQbCoMQfZi96sthe194", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1irQgAEeS7BWGMAnidUv4Mq5QWis18q2qe"], "tags": ["french", "rap", "music", "hip-hop", "rat-race", "covid", "sketch"], "extra": {}}
