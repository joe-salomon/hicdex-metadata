In this work I use the main object that is carrying hammers and scales inscribed with heaven and hell as if the law and fate of a person are in his hands, describing the attitude of man who always judged other humans, then reinforced again with the writings of infidels\u201dkafir\u201d and holly crossed out describing so bitterly he to punish others as if heaven and hell were in his hands.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmewpe2NETG5dKY9DY37kTM7ixHHQ2oqSTiZzsXfroLYMb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcRHiaR9PAmhpBSr8ukcFHzwoYCBG8LNMBSTuoMYw1XD4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmewpe2NETG5dKY9DY37kTM7ixHHQ2oqSTiZzsXfroLYMb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LRmTHhPB68ZXynoChC6HVvLF2ZDTG6LyP"], "tags": ["nft", "painting", "fineart", "nftcollectible", "semfvck", "nftcollector", "artwork", "artpaint", "rawart", "ekspresif", ""], "extra": {}}
