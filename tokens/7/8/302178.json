Collectively we are wasting each year the equivalent of millions of years of human consciousness. The energy that could be used to focus on complex goals, to provide for enjoyable growth, is squandered on patterns of stimulation that only mimic reality. Mass leisure, mass culture, and even high culture when only attended to passively and for extrinsic reasons\u2014such as the wish to flaunt one\u2019s status\u2014are parasites of the mind. They absorb psychic energy without providing substantive strength in return. They leave us more exhausted, more disheartened than we were before.\u201c\u2800\nFrom \u201dFlow\u201d by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\" \n\nHappy 256ths day of 2021 everyone ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihorrufezgoz5azz2r7ec57rkqjpdvzzsyyt3h5sxqlndeshvrmmq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicdbpj5ivolze65tdbz3opz2muljjy6aoi4r5jdw726myg4a6dtua", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihorrufezgoz5azz2r7ec57rkqjpdvzzsyyt3h5sxqlndeshvrmmq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LeudY3nLTqfhXKwBcTn6vvbx8PVYpPkoD"], "tags": ["OBJEKT4OBJEKT", "objkt4objkt", "glitch", "abstract", "glitchartist", "bw", "blackandwhite", "black&white"], "extra": {}}
