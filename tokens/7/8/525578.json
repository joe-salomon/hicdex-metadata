This series is about geometric shapes, compositions and simplicity. When excessive elements, colors and decorations are trimmed away you can explore the rhythm, tension between shapes and the interaction of elements and white space. The more you look and examine, the more fascinating details you find. Sometimes the less is definitely more.\n\n\nSize: 3500 x 3500 px / Format: jpg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS6diTFQ7EGztMEADyRxqi9NQF2EzEQySpMvx1Rz8LpMm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeeD5pU93dBqsupKh337Vxboqgda2ZDvLr3xsahVHEjj2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS6diTFQ7EGztMEADyRxqi9NQF2EzEQySpMvx1Rz8LpMm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TSqWk6wy9A9FQt8Ecj772f1c7UncyafoT"], "tags": ["minimalism", "art", "geometry", "simplicity", "art", "minimal", "design", "geometric", "isometric"], "extra": {}}
