It has a length of 39cm (16 in), a weight of 16kg (35lbs), and a black gunmetal construction, and uses massive 13mm explosive rounds. The words \"Jesus Christ is in Heaven now\"  are engraved upon it, in mockery of a similar statement on Alexander Anderson's gloves.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWXvKvtD86NhzRW7nT73YvavkGxiAJpjR1GQAk65MuN67", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW7ckikhn2Hv2m2U5jNagyA24haznnG77NQUPqZ7EG67a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWXvKvtD86NhzRW7nT73YvavkGxiAJpjR1GQAk65MuN67", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1X4KxGvXc3R4Q7AuEE5uqNk8brsjDAkGKs"], "tags": ["Hellsing", "anime", "loop", "abstraction", "animemuseum", "render", "vampire", "weapon", "animation", "collectible"], "extra": {}}
