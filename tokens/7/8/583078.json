When I lived in Atlanta I was involved in this group of people known as the Box Heroes which entailed wearing these elaborately designed and painted suits out of cardboard in the likeness of our favorite super heroes. I  have owned several full suits and have painted dozens more, and the only DC character I ever made for myself was Martian Manhunter. Sometimes you just want to go on a vacation from yourself... and cosplay is actually a great way to do that.
