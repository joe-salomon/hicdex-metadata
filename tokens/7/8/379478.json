The whole look was inspired by @justcallmekim_makeup 's visit, and needing a place for her to stay. When I found this room I knew we just had to shoot there!!! I just kept getting luckier, because the incredible harness designers @Broke_Boutique (Kim's harness) and @TommyVowles (Muza's harness) contributed to the shoot, and my dear friend and creative conspirator @muza_mermaidova sewed these super crazy red outfits aaaand modeled as well! Then the ever talented Kim did the makeup on herself and Muza, and this evil deer magic was made! It was a great creative day!! Thank you to everyone who participated!\n*\nHarnesses by @Broke_Boutique (right)\nHarness by @TommyVowles (left)\nOutfits and Left model @muza_mermaidova\nHeaddresses/Photos @BubblesAndFrown\nMakeup and right model @justcallmekim_makeup", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaVdKqJpJBdHczCHNFTQxXMRVfFivp5PBnJrH31rxbd5t", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVxe5Sjqe9uMCkv61G7hfC6MdoEidKAaR1iAPMMCnybsP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaVdKqJpJBdHczCHNFTQxXMRVfFivp5PBnJrH31rxbd5t", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ij4fDuptsj21qW1zqr3LDCERjbbC9rGcn"], "tags": ["headdress", "headpiece", "deer", "antlers", "goth", "alternative", "bodyharness", "fetish", "evil", "halloween", "photography", "model", "woman", "berlin", "vegan", "stockings", "fishnet", "bondage", "blackandwhite", "redgloves", ""], "extra": {}}
