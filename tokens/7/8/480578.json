Poor Alice was enchanted by an evil Sea-Witch and forced to dance corny Polka music. But no more! Still sprouting horns and donning a mystical Oni Mask the witch bound her to wear; Alice has become liberated at last! \nBut Alice isn\u2019t just a hairy boot stomping monster. Oh no! The once unwilling captive, Alice now dances to the beat of her own drummer. With Thriller dance moves and an original soundtrack by Canttias, Alice gyrates however no longer a minion of the evil sorceress!\nWith her gender ambiguous Alice and her two Gunkanjima Sisters dance in perfect choreography. On this abandoned island lies a mysterious Lamborghini Aventador by Shadewar, with a 3D Three-story house model by Denis Loginovskiy in the background.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWaZm7etNdPhpReL8Q5Bs6QAeDZziKnhRf8TSjoz7YiBe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNnJ5FA1ndzxQzYX9r8aCjg6QCwrHxkzhSFWyExSWhsTb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWaZm7etNdPhpReL8Q5Bs6QAeDZziKnhRf8TSjoz7YiBe", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hTZNv7Ui8o1oPWiYkC9bv4GAZdyAGS2qs"], "tags": ["3D", "Animation", "Video", "Music", "Dance", "Cartoon", "Alice", "Goon", "Witch", "Oni", "Horns", "Synthwave", "RetroElectro", "Sorceress", "Soundtrack", "MP3", "Demonic", "Possession", "Lamborghini", "Lambo"], "extra": {}}
