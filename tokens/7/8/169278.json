It is about the effect of a moving curl field inside a constant linear field. There is an interesting moment in the middle of the loop when two curl fields with the same power and radius but with the opposite direction neutralize each other for an instant of time.\nloop, 1000x1000 pixels, 60 fps (241 frames)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSog8pdPwsovf4rBbkkdooYy7Dc3iCbtZNT3D5aPRGJRJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTocXsYTz4YC72pYJjWb7oyb2RMhPActdrayVixyMVhQh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSog8pdPwsovf4rBbkkdooYy7Dc3iCbtZNT3D5aPRGJRJ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Z4JpibgLqjjSPS4JE8Dcpajkt3qb2WdpN"], "tags": ["generative", "computational", "math", "mathart", "forcefields", "vectorfields", "algorithms"], "extra": {}}
