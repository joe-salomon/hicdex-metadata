Kyla was down, she thought it was piles of fun! I won\u2019t get into the mechanics here, but I will say that the method we used was tricky. It involved lots and lots of outtakes, things that simply weren\u2019t working. That\u2019s what happens with experimentation! \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUHddcyYqCS6ip5oKZ4NsLoPs8qFGXDcyKtAXhT1hH688", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYTBrsm9TkGGKZDysMs8gZPdLbMDPP7cHLJQVPJyimw8J", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUHddcyYqCS6ip5oKZ4NsLoPs8qFGXDcyKtAXhT1hH688", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["portraitlightmotionphotomagicmodel"], "extra": {}}
