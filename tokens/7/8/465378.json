The result is used to paint a color for this exact pixel. \n\nThe result is a huge collection of pseudo-fractal images which evoke impossible landscapes, crowded cities, glitchy psychedelic with vivid colors or just beautiful patterns. All of them are deterministic given its initial parameters.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW4tCcKQDeZmRnyLoaWXYPvPGUHXoc19H2Y3ZUzH9kCmT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdaZ3sXtUNN5F45DuuGmBXdC47FWtb3eX3MMK8bpivqeu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW4tCcKQDeZmRnyLoaWXYPvPGUHXoc19H2Y3ZUzH9kCmT", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SpToaU7V2HkUJ3KjJmRFx9k2XFAJH5Sc6"], "tags": ["fractal", "codeart", "math", "js", "genart", "abstract", "art", "algorithmic", "script", "generative", "colorful", "glitch", "creativecode", "unique", "binarylandscape", "binarylandscapes"], "extra": {}}
