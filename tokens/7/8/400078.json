{"__version": 1, "token_id": 400078, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Libration II", "description": "Libration is the wagging or wavering of the Moon perceived by Earth-bound observers and caused by changes in their perspective. It permits an observer to see slightly different hemispheres of the surface at different times. It is similar in both cause and effect to the changes in the Moon's apparent size due to changes in distance.\n\nIn this project, 3D replicas of spherical concrete bollards in my hometown of Istanbul, produced by my collective 'oddviz', have been used. People painted bollards in colors starting with the Gezi uprising in Istanbul and it became a tradition. They are painted again and again with solid colors, patterns, or tags while changing with weather, impacts, and maintenance. Each bollard became unique by interference. They reflected the culture and history of the city. As everyday objects, the uniqueness and beauty of these objects have not been noticed.\n\nLunar libration is a fascinating motion caused by the laws of physics. Moon and these bollards are structurally similar and they are both everyday objects, but one has to look at the sky to see the first, and to the ground to see the latter. In this context, 'Libration' reforms our perspective on everyday objects.\n\n2160 x 2160 px, 0\u201928\u201d \nAudio by Asl\u0131 Din\u00e7 (@kitschita)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdGxDVAsKZFbJbemGy36br5NVnT3tDv6vVhZxnAeU48XE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYKAgFTRfEfiFxtrhvnegyFwTbT7CbitHRUFpQZoXxJLG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdGxDVAsKZFbJbemGy36br5NVnT3tDv6vVhZxnAeU48XE", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QUgtPkZTsczKCmuTArg8naZSYEbaZotdL"], "tags": ["3d", "video", "moon", "lunar", "space", "astronomy", "planet", "istanbul", "bollard", "photogrammetry", "street"], "extra": {}}
