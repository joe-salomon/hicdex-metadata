Upon walking into the traditional museum setting, I couldn't help but notice the contrasting pink walls and thick blue carpet. The pink walls seemed like a unique contemporary decision in my opinion, intentional or not. The exhibition design revealed how the museum captured \"whiteness\" in its portraiture collection. The room felt dream-like, and lost in time. There was a curated piece of history left out of this showcase. The exhibition made me think about my own home town in South Dakota, and how often I never payed attention to what culture and history was curated in front of me. It seems cyclical? Was the director aware too?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd2Hao4D29XNvkgCNt3gfPkiToUedjYy9AmhMSiy5xVjk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSXTrJXGpumBjUdtx5y3reH7FDL1FNmidzYXdXEzaky2h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd2Hao4D29XNvkgCNt3gfPkiToUedjYy9AmhMSiy5xVjk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NtqWafoTDZPhXkTDBx678LK1BYTaFVTSD"], "tags": ["history", "museum", "art", "curate", "privilege", "design"], "extra": {}}
