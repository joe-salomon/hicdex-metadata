The Tiles are sorted according to the hidden population of Points inside the Cube as well excluded in the same proportion as the Population of the Points inside/outside the scaled Sphere. The hided Points are highlighted at the end as well connected with the pattern of triangulation \"Delaunay\". \nGIF 1024*1024px / 181 frames.\n\n_\nR=Search_Pattern\n\nThe artwork`s experiment is playing around the topic of how the data patterns are linked and transformed into each other in abstract 3d world. The arrays of different data items such as \"points\", \"quads\" or \"object`s settings\" could be transformed into each other in harmonic way. What type of transformations or What kind of interpretations is possiple to apply to transform the patterns into each other? The experiment is artistic and the process is quite important as well the possibility to check the different ways of artistic approach to transform the patterns in some special individual ways.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbhxSvo3YwqjUEztSLApo2GKXZcKw3MC9f4DU99xfffL3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbhxSvo3YwqjUEztSLApo2GKXZcKw3MC9f4DU99xfffL3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbhxSvo3YwqjUEztSLApo2GKXZcKw3MC9f4DU99xfffL3", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Mpr7WD3UG47UFPbizLPnBCNhh8pcdbSyz"], "tags": ["patterns", "research", "v4w.enko", "cube", "sphere", "points", "poppulation", "minimalistic", "abstract", "proportions", "geometry", "3d", "opengl", "data", "matrix"], "extra": {}}
