This genesis series is a collection of 50 Kilims inspired by traditional rugs produced in countries of the former Persian Empire. Each Kilim is made of 6 slightly identical squares of 20x20 pixels. Each pixel has been enlarged and redrawn with a 6x6 matrix of circles to simulate the weave of the rug. I then animated the squares independently and attached them together to compose the kilim.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQGSQu71AAnYLji8XSAHVLgA2sTjkvzt6Wf1gw6jbnpBs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQGSQu71AAnYLji8XSAHVLgA2sTjkvzt6Wf1gw6jbnpBs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQGSQu71AAnYLji8XSAHVLgA2sTjkvzt6Wf1gw6jbnpBs", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQGSQu71AAnYLji8XSAHVLgA2sTjkvzt6Wf1gw6jbnpBs", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Zf39VWdhUbMCav4zCYunuKFkxyhfDqCgh"], "tags": ["pixelart", "rug", "kilim", "animated", "gif", "loop", "pixel", "shinzonoda"], "extra": {}}
