In this case, for the purpose of scanning the artwork, I deliberately divided the artwork (after a lot of inking and coloring) into sixteen quadrants with three vertical and three horizontal folds. \n\nThis was a risk, since I couldn't be sure, until after performing the actual task, that creating these folds wouldn't be destructive to the final result (wasting the previous efforts made).\n\nFor these and other reasons, this artwork is titled 'Faith' and the artwork is now framed and on sale at New Vision Art (based in Orem, Utah).\n\nThis photograph of the artwork atop my light table helps to communicate the raw efforts and emotionally visceral process involved in creating the work.\n\nThis original artwork is by Daniel H.
