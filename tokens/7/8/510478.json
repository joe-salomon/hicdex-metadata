The warm climate, a large amount of food, and a small flock population on a large island made life calm and measured. There were few predators and practically nothing threatened us.\n\nWe ate a lot of fruit, chewed the invigorating leaves of trees, frolicked a lot and multiplied. At some point, my life was reduced to an incessant cycle of childbirth. I gave birth to many offspring and nursed them.\n\nDeath overtook me unexpectedly. My vision failed. Thinking I was grabbing a branch, I grabbed a snake, which immediately bit me. The whole body became very painful and there was nothing to breathe. The pounding in my chest stopped. The soul left a completely worn-out spacesuit, which fully fulfilled its physiological function.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTmAR8xr1eBiVuovk8myJ8dB7CTdz4etBLMcWiDcsp2nT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmezhbW19uLt2zD6sSRB3oeSy3LTGr6CJ2ksAtzueCFiYc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTmAR8xr1eBiVuovk8myJ8dB7CTdz4etBLMcWiDcsp2nT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YxuH9J2fMdEQ3wXX5Fi2dfAapsAJkKBiC"], "tags": ["42", "EndlessHistory", "DigitalArt", "Adventure", "ScienceFiction", "Cryptoapostol6", "Cryptoapostol12", "ArtificialIntelligence"], "extra": {}}
