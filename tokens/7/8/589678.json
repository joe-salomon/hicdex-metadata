Yes, there are many kinds of Sacis out there. The \u201cPerer\u00ea\u201d specimen is usually a single-legged very dark-skinned boy who smokes a pipe, wears a red hood and transports himself on a mini hurricane. This description can sometimes change, and Saci-Perer\u00ea can also be described as an old man instead of a boy. Nevertheless, he is always single-legged and dark-skinned.\n\nSome say that his name comes from the Tupi Guarani language: \u00e7aa cy means \u201cevil eye\u201d and p\u00e9r\u00e9r\u00e9g means \u201cleaping\u201d, so Saci-Perer\u00ea could be interpreted like \u201cThe leaping evil eye\u201d.\n\nAlthough his name suggests something evil, Saci-Perer\u00ea is not a monster and most of the time he is not evil either. In some of his stories, we may consider that he behaves like a spoiled child who wants to have everything done their way, otherwise they get aggressive. Saci-Perer\u00ea can appear to you asking something \u2014 usually tobacco. If you refuse to give it to him, then you\u2019ll face the consequences \u2014 just like tricks or treat for Halloween.\n\nEvery time someone starts talking about Saci-Perer\u00ea you can expect to hear some of his tricks, which involve:\n\nDeceiving people;\nStealing tobacco;\nStealing/scaring away cows, horses and hens;\nBreaking dishes while no one is looking (so, if you do break something, blame him!);\nSouring the milk;\nMaking knots on animals fur, mainly on horses tail;\nHiding objects inside people\u2019s houses.\nFurthermore, if we go deep into Saci-Perer\u00ea\u2019s archetype, we can conclude that he is the trickster of Brazilian folklore.\n\nIt is said that if you can catch a Saci-Perer\u00ea, he will make anything you wish, so he can be free again. Others point out that all you have to do is to steal his hood because it\u2019s magical and it can make you rich. Anyway, I don\u2019t know anyone who has ever caught a Saci-Perer\u00ea, he\u2019s too fast in his hurricane.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWdFp3cZ8ZP5FkEZ3KtY5xC3TExzb6vNwJxN5DQvrgGwj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNjZfJ2KL2ZXfcWRLR6htFvPqFF7e9qZG3tfBYHBEFxe5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWdFp3cZ8ZP5FkEZ3KtY5xC3TExzb6vNwJxN5DQvrgGwj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RT3cu9Hiv3FqvmXKefiKYnaQoN11ER99K"], "tags": ["saciperere", "3d", "lowpoly", "brasil", "brazilianfolk"], "extra": {}}
