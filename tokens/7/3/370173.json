The skull's resonant frequency is in tune with the electromagnetic field emanated by humans. The unique electromagnetic field signature of the human carrying the Transmutational Healing Cranium would be tuned back to its healthy pattern, thus transmuting disease at the quantum level.\n\nOther living forms' magnetic fields would not be tuned to the Transmutational Healing Cranium and would not activate it.\n\nThe POWERSKULLZ are part of the POWERVERSE, a reality where humans have achieved their highest potential and live as gods.\n\n_\nGIF - 50 fps - 1080 x 1080 px\n\n_\nThanks to @billellis for the amazing skull model.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXzMUNQ8L8HZWKJqzfVSJScJhkPXSd1SsFiQeMtTByr9o", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXzMUNQ8L8HZWKJqzfVSJScJhkPXSd1SsFiQeMtTByr9o", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXzMUNQ8L8HZWKJqzfVSJScJhkPXSd1SsFiQeMtTByr9o", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cALi4cQRKtSMCU92nkmtQtZPZGppeHke1"], "tags": ["cranium", "death", "skull", "mementomori", "objkt4objkt", "glow", "billellis", "cyberpunk", ""], "extra": {}}
