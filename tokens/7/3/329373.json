According to local myths, the creature is believed to be the manifestation of a person practicing black magic to help people become rich instantly, but in exchange they must sacrifice their humanity, allowing themselves to be transformed into a boar-like demon. The human-animal transformation is similar to shapeshifting or lycanthropy in the West.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSLzVB9fvW9FzN57V6HWtQyxTmFtuzbxm8UBqUGLXjMWp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmABKytcNgbPNtBvSt9TJBb3mBhqvkH9z37ARN7QrMFi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSLzVB9fvW9FzN57V6HWtQyxTmFtuzbxm8UBqUGLXjMWp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XLubg3ayqnV1Eu3wzFNnZ1tsLKNxUJak4"], "tags": ["illustration", "sketch", "digital", "colorful", "blue", "yellow", "red", "orange", "nftclean", "objktbot", "abstract."], "extra": {}}
