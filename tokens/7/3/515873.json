Emptiness, depression, anxiety, are factors that lead to hopelessness for the life that is being lived.  all meaningless actions, all expectations poisoned with inferiority.  This poem is written in Indonesian.  To make it easier for you, I provide a translation in English.  maybe this English does not cover the whole meaning (because of the difference in meaning equivalent), but hopefully the essence of this poem is conveyed.\n\ndancing in the fireplace\n\n1. \nHesitate to digest the lost life\nThere is no means for me\nto make room for the possibility to say;  why? \nThe opaque mist led me into the abyss of nothingness\nThe wound is transformed into the world\nWith his rejection of the problems of life in the void\nThe spirit of grieving that is increasingly felt\nand the arrogance of problems such as age that refuses to grow old.\n-\nhell I feel so real\nThe soul is increasingly sinking into an incomplete framework called Anger\nThe waves did not find their calm\nAnger is my friend against the world\nFight fire with fire and create the hell\nDismay and anger found his home\nOn the soul of the sorrowful who is feeling hell.\n\nArifansdr\n2017.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXJsMQoP2BwpnyvuHeoKU4vNAMmQA57GZeZCYHw1pbReG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSQ12MouAyNH6kNCEUUqq28ePiotHYY6Us5xLMo47rSdb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXJsMQoP2BwpnyvuHeoKU4vNAMmQA57GZeZCYHw1pbReG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28f36EsUqgfUBVUvBq5KsmSWRqdrfD8mnC"], "tags": ["Menaridiperapian", "arifansdr", "poetry", "poem", "photography", "blacknwhite"], "extra": {}}
