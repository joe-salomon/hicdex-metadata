All the pictures show women in the best versions of themselves. The woman, like the red color for me, conveys sexuality, beauty and power. And the crimson color goes hand in hand with the woman. Every job has its meaning, but I suggest you find something in common in each peace.\n\nSelf-love is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth. And this girl shows us lots of self-love. I dedicate this work to all women.  We all sometimes lack confidence in ourselves, and I want it to be abundant. We are awesome! We are amazing! We are beautiful!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidgsv5v76omcfmmgwsi7jcvdqelnqnch5ahvjpazg5vwlgwywfj54", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreia6a7hucoqx6kax232sth5fng3jjraozkrirq6hziljc4i5oxfuty", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidgsv5v76omcfmmgwsi7jcvdqelnqnch5ahvjpazg5vwlgwywfj54", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["redunion", "self-love", "women"], "extra": {}}
