Light up your cigarette to see the signs; it's weirdly silent and dark tonight. It's unbelievably quiet and dark tonight. Has this dead-end ever been this silent and dark? I've reached home now, went up the stairs stalling my friends to take a moment and chat with you. Not a single word was spoken during our time together. I told you to be careful with everything and left home to live yet another night of despair while feeling unconsciously happy.  It's silent; It's dark outside. The silence is killing me. Yesterday I chose to walk to work, and it was too quiet to be true, the snow made it even more silent, as I reached around the corner, decided to take a taxi, stood still for about fifteen minutes, watching the cars go by, a white car passed, another white car and yet another white car went on its way, the passing of the white cars made the silence even more noticeable. I found out yesterday that I've been wasting my time trying to make this seem worthwhile. I'm going to go now. I'm going to go ahead and destroy this; my life would be an homage to all the \"Days Spent Walking In The Cold,\" be it me or you.\n\n30x30Cm 300DPI", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQpQsAaoChkGXGehvWNh71H8rk1iBri4XWaboHDaDPC3g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdMivNmvDwLJdGh4b6XQ7g2B3MdDGAWKcjBJiNvs1s6ue", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQpQsAaoChkGXGehvWNh71H8rk1iBri4XWaboHDaDPC3g", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YEXFMCxuFSbJJw83gCbpXotgu8oR5oKJe"], "tags": ["Illustration", "Story", "Shortstory", "Sketch", "Collage", "Mixedmedia", "Photography", "DigitalArt", "Art", "CaveTheNick"], "extra": {}}
