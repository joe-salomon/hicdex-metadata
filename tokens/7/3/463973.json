Yates (Holy Fool)", "description": "[Colored pencil, brush pen, liner pen, and felt pen on reclaimed cardboard with some digital color embellishment.] I floated on the magical boat thru the dangerous rocks and tides, and the sky melted into millions of colors.

What a nice way to spend an eternity... ---Richard F.
