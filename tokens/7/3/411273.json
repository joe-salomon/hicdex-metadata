Watching old episodes of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air\" with Will Smith, James Avery, Alfonso Ribeiro, Tatyana Ali, Karyn Parsons, Joseph Marcell, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and so many other amazing actors, reminded me of simpler times of the early 1990s. All that mattered was skateboarding with friends, listening to grunge music, learning about art, drawing, painting, writing fucking god awful poetry, an unhealthy obsession with Kate Moss, reeking of cK One cologne wherever you went, baggy pants that were at least 5-10 sizes to big that parents absolutely loathed and hated with the fire of 1,000 suns, entering the world of dating, experiencing rap music for the first time and being introduced to hip-hop as a lifestyle, going to NYC every weekend to skateboard at the World Trade Center, and so much more. THIS is the pleasure and danger of being nostalgic. You get wrapped up in it like a warm blanket on a cold winter's night; you never want to take it off. Unfortunately, life keeps moving on; time keeps ticking on. The fictitious anti-hero Adrian Veidt from Alan Moore's epic graphic novel (arguably the greatest of all-time), used the following tagline for his line of \"Nostalgia\" products, \"Oh, how the ghost of you clings\". Seems quite apropos right about now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSdnG9WgVJvYeVFZHdR9T1BfZxEUimmL2t9ocssgL2KEa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUQdkXECJ83h1aEcJNNA4KMAmdT72p46ybnBv9G3YcVRE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSdnG9WgVJvYeVFZHdR9T1BfZxEUimmL2t9ocssgL2KEa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
