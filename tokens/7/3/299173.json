His name honestly slips my mind these days as we haven't spoke in sometime.\nWhen we met, he let me know he came down to Houston from DC for a job. When he got here it turned out that the job wasn't real, and now he was here with no money and no job to make money.\nI got his phone number and let him know I'd be calling him to help him get back to DC.\nThe next day we were on the phone looking at bus tickets to get him back. I helped him out with the ticket and told him to let me know when he made it home.\nI'll never forget when he sent me a picture of him back home with his family. He was so happy to be back and I was happy for him.\nI may have forgotten his name, but I'll never forget our interaction.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeig3lsypijxrjjez63dnuwcvgxbteuhznrtdf3uqvsvmhco6encmlm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifbgucbh5jvauxacctwz6v2blvmpqgitfck4rpsqjsjqdof4sn3ma", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeig3lsypijxrjjez63dnuwcvgxbteuhznrtdf3uqvsvmhco6encmlm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
