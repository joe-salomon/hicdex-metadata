You'll feel drawn by the music but when you enter you must pass 3 tests: defeating a foul red-eyed goat, a straight hair snake with a horse head called Vibor\u00f3n and lastly to challenge a 'criollo' basilisk that can kill you just by staring at you. If the initiated one overcomes these tests they'll get a longed gift for life./\n\n\ud835\ude0b\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude09\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude2a (@\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude3b\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2c) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc7b8MQd6eeEQgx9D98ry9YggS4cjhj33KFatoCQpTETh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfSiEs7dyJsa2QYNN59HNhcwVuW9pMx4H9X4jCApiTfyX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc7b8MQd6eeEQgx9D98ry9YggS4cjhj33KFatoCQpTETh", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
