With these short references I want to highlight the fact that it is impossible to cancel the future. Hence, I want to stress: if we consider it is possible, then, who cancels the future? And the future of who or what? \n\nFrom a metaphysical point of view, matter was, is and will be. It is the accelerated infosphere what blocks our capacity to act now, in the present, to think and built alternative futures to the catastrophic one scientists, biologists, sociologists and maybe economists are predicting. Franco Berardi (2018) states that \u201cwhen the acceleration of cyberspace breaks the rhythm of mental time, and we no longer know what is relevant and what is irrelevant in our surrounding environment, this is what we call \u201cchaos\u201d: the inability to attribute meaning to the flow, the breakdown of our framework of relevance. A special vibration of the soul spreads out at this point, which we call \u201cpanic\u201d: the subjective recording of chaos.\u201d Therefore, it is the accelerated infosphere who is cancelling something: the present \u2013human, and non-human.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNmkUKRKHKDKN2185Xb2dGuKMwLV17KzENQ1UMzCbED7K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTjQEWeNTcnRdsV47NvSfjmMDBxzMpbjuSivaM79XEiJ4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNmkUKRKHKDKN2185Xb2dGuKMwLV17KzENQ1UMzCbED7K", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cQe16CdsBZnGz4awrh4p3u1xK7o5QApd5"], "tags": [], "extra": {}}
