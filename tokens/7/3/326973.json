The Boa was never found. Her name was Muriel.\nAs no one had ever succeeded in portraying Queen Verena, eventually the entire population, even her own son, began to forget her face.\nWhen Filomenus turned 15 years old, he asked for his mother to be exhumed and for Sandra Mort, a renowned artist of the region, to paint her. Sandra Mort brought her own boa to pose. Her name was Lorna.\nThe result was the painting \"THE DEAD QUEEN\", cultural patrimony of Morondanga Republik, valued at more than 477 billion tezos.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRqLNMPZLmUYtYME3FrUcTveRj1giYnTVkfmBKWnJBbhX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXBRbvRbbC4yfZKXiwiqhBvBivb48K7t8pXoJZ6pNfc9S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRqLNMPZLmUYtYME3FrUcTveRj1giYnTVkfmBKWnJBbhX", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Queen", "Dead", "Stamp"], "extra": {}}
