I've always been heavily influenced by popular media and with the onset of Covid entertainment has only gotten BETTER whether it be tv, movies or video games. This is another homage to an animated show that I just finished watching named Arcane and is based on a VERY popular video game called League of Legends. I really didn't know anything about this franchise and I was instantly hooked. The animation is amazing and I became obsessed with many of the characters almost immediately. I became heavily invested in the fates of the 2 sisters whose life takes some major turns throughout the first season and I couldn't help gravitate towards Vi. My daughters name is Violet and I often call her Vi, and the character from the show can't help but be a guardian and protector of not only her sister but of everyone she meets, and I love that. Today's design is for sure a heartfelt kiss hello to the champion Vi!
