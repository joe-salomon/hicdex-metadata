The idea behind this was to recreate traditional paintings I'm really fond as a way of studying the greats since I've never had any \"formal\" training in the arts. As \"rules\" for this exercise, I established that I must use my own style and color palette without losing the essence of the original piece. \nAll pieces in this series are highly textured 3000x3000px PNGs created in only four colors (cyan, magenta, yellow and black), with all tone variations done only using black halftones to maintain the stipulated 4 colors.
