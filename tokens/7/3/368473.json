We were staying on Maui and took a whale tour between the islands. The large female surfaced quite near the boat and began rolling and waving her flipper in the air. I have been fascinated by humpback whales ever since and began painting them in 2013.\n\nThis painting shows an adult humpback whale breeching at sunrise. I have been on many whale watching tours in my life and looking back on my videos none of the ones I have personally seen breeched this high. Imagination is a wonderful thing.
