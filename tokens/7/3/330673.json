They can be puns or other types of word play as well. In this case what makes this one work is that the viewer could read the words as if someone was saying, this thing didn't have to be like this, it could have been made completely differently; literally. There is the emotional aspect of a different type of entendre implied as well, like in a romantic relationship, where two people are breaking up. What makes this so powerful is the use of \"it\". What is \"it\"? It can be anything and we use that word constantly in our lives. It's such a versatile word that creates abstraction in our syntax and it goes kind of unnoticed in our daily lives. When I created this, NYC was getting hit hard by COVID19. The news kept getting worse and worse all because the proper measures weren't taken by the Trump administration at a key moment in time (Late January/Early February). Some of you maybe reading this and scoffing at my words, but you have to understand that there was a small window of time where the federal government could have prepared the nation. Hundreds of thousands of lives could have been spared, millions of families wouldn't be burying loved ones had they taken action. You may or may not be political...one thing is certain, it didn't have to be this way.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbCDS7E3hcsSykMpN6RSaMv5iKB4HKtDd9po3Jk7gyEwk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUYHsuE8Hp34LR1e7yBehDErwEGEZuKcKxr21SgeMQFF1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbCDS7E3hcsSykMpN6RSaMv5iKB4HKtDd9po3Jk7gyEwk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
