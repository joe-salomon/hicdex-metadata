The first queen of god; AZALEA, lives in the void space that she created called JAGADJIGO. One day she decided to divide herself, manifesting her Dzat into the trinity of god that we know; MVDRA, SVNYA, and KVLLA. They were created with Insecta combined with Dzat Azalea.\n\nMvdra is the firstborn, he was born from Dzat moth. Svnya is the second and Kvlla is the third born. Azalea manifests herself and also her mind into this trinity, and lets them have their own consciousness and control. This trinity of god must seek the purpose of their birth and why Azalea split herself.\n\n1080x1350 px\nIllustration combined with AI generative image.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ7WxEqV4hJhtAU5Gycd5rU1bfNzRykdHXvBpW3J9VzKo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ7WxEqV4hJhtAU5Gycd5rU1bfNzRykdHXvBpW3J9VzKo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ7WxEqV4hJhtAU5Gycd5rU1bfNzRykdHXvBpW3J9VzKo", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1infpVZtfVR8RcJAVyHPfZ8ij5MLciPTfm"], "tags": ["Illustration", "AIgenerative", "characterdesign", "originalcharacter", "JAGADJIGO", "NFT", "NFTcommunity", "mvdra", "scifi"], "extra": {}}
