This animation is then split into frames, which are randomly stacked in groups of 3 or 4 to occlude each other in sequence, creating an infinite set of shapes mimicking biological formations. Perhaps of mould growth in a petri dish, of microscopic cellular automata, or even the formation of large scale structures in the universe.\n\nClick to regenerate forms, move the cursor to gently move your creation.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbUhhc7mxL6sVLijY9EZJ5CGCxgpf2iqh5sut9kdxfajp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaWhjBkBZEya2DTAXLWbeACeNSaF9wTPUzr38hMEPQm3c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbUhhc7mxL6sVLijY9EZJ5CGCxgpf2iqh5sut9kdxfajp", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["Biology", "geometry", "universe", "mould", "genart", "collage", "blender", "animation", "digital", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
