Pondered it's indissociable relation to life itself, it's reach across the planet, across our souls and bodies, across humankind's different cultures and how important it is to think about water, sound and light as we think about life and ancestry (Make of that what you will). Talked with the shroom entity about how water is a timeless pillar to consciousness and the health of Gaia. The trip was long, lots of sybolisms, maybe you'll have a glimpse of the experience upon seeing this drawing.  \n\nMade with: \n\n- 300gsm watercolor paper\n- Acrylic paint\n- Grey marker\n- 2-4B Pencil\n- Nankin pen", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW9eVZXWU4HmBHvDQF9UhnjTghcKdzRFtqBuEvxZc77wC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmauFphTE6oM2NNa6GGkcJamoebxYsN1iwVxrvtezw3MAg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW9eVZXWU4HmBHvDQF9UhnjTghcKdzRFtqBuEvxZc77wC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RkQFcwXPPpYZtP8M1Yv2TCYLuALbqpx43"], "tags": ["illustration", "nankin", "acrylic", "traditionalart", "water", "life", "soul"], "extra": {}}
