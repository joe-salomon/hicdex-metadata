{"__version": 1, "token_id": 316573, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Bengal Cat", "description": "The Bengal cat is a large, sleek and very muscular cat with a thick tail that is carried low. The Bengal cat's wild appearance is enhanced by its distinctive thick and luxurious spotted or marbled coat. Its broad head has small ears and pronounced whisker pads and its eyes are black rimmed and almond shaped. The tail is thick, tapering to a black tip. There is no other breed of cat which displays the gold or pearl dusting effect (glitter) found on some Bengal cats and can be very demanding because of high activity levels.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcvG77NyYdALkCpoEC7ndAWSc9hp65ncsewdyD36kfvva", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcvG77NyYdALkCpoEC7ndAWSc9hp65ncsewdyD36kfvva", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcvG77NyYdALkCpoEC7ndAWSc9hp65ncsewdyD36kfvva", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["cat", "pixel", "pixelart", "animal", "pet", "objkt4objkt"], "extra": {}}
