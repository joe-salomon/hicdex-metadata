To disguise herself and do her mission, Cheonsa runs Coffee Cat, a caf\u00e9 that caters to all animals in town. Her most frequent customers are Danny Dog, Rita Rabbit, Paulie Penguin, Chase Chick, Owen Owl and Barry Bear. Each of them has his/her own likes and dislikes as well as good and bad traits. With her yummy food and drinks, little pieces of advice and some help with their needs, Cheonsa inspires them to become better versions of themselves. This NFT is one of Cheonsa's friends and caf\u00e9 customers, Owen Owl.\n\nOwen Owl is a librarian. He falls asleep a lot during his day job so he goes to the caf\u00e9 often to get his daily dose of coffee to wake himself up. Knowing how smart he is, he sometimes has a tendency to be overconfident. He does not like being corrected. However, he can be counted on in times of trouble. At night, he gives advice and words of wisdom to fellow animals and even read them bedtime stories to put them to sleep.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcVAytuNZweKwzYFmqbXZinbQUcPrJCsYKtS67pM871k7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcVAytuNZweKwzYFmqbXZinbQUcPrJCsYKtS67pM871k7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcVAytuNZweKwzYFmqbXZinbQUcPrJCsYKtS67pM871k7", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QDfxJj5XEpGdnJMEbDYJLMUkpZiHiTUGQ"], "tags": ["collection", "collectibles", "gif", "character", "cute", "animals", "animated", "cartoon", "image", "animatedgif", "owl", ""], "extra": {}}
