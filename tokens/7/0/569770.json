{"__version": 1, "token_id": 569770, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Launch From Space", "description": "The sound composition \u201cLaunch from Space\u201d is comprised of live recordings of Pauline Oliveros and Andrew Deutsch performing duos. This is a statement from Andrew: Both Pauline and I produced electronic and acoustic sounds together. Sometimes I processed her sounds and occasionally she processed mine. Many of these recordings took place during sound checks where our performance was most free and experimental. \n\nThese recordings have never been published, and they remain in my personal archive. I took some time, but after Pauline\u2019s passing, I began the slow process of composing a piece based on these recordings. \"Launch From Space\u201d is a tribute to Pauline\u2019s love of the sensual nature of sound, including both noise and tone. \u201cLaunch From Space\u201d is a digital composition comprised of a composite of sound loops and performance steams processed exclusively with GRM tools.\n\nAn excerpt of this composition was played at Experimental Intermedia as an element of a Carrier Band performance. \u201cLaunch From Space\u201d also reflects a conceptual model Pauline suggested. She said if you want to make something new or gain an understanding of something, you should launch from space, or the moon.\n\nInteractive visuals by Eric Souther", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf8jEmocCK7B3iugqHjs6Fna2bUiy1G4AnjyRqBDfPLds", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV6ujbt1eYSBFi2cTPbLwNF8HDQqx4WiDuxKsHV3D6NPi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf8jEmocCK7B3iugqHjs6Fna2bUiy1G4AnjyRqBDfPLds", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1eYdZXuh9MvXPGq3DGuNPCZRpTMJz1DEYV"], "tags": ["launchfromspace", "space", "experimentalmusic", "Oliveros", "Deutsch", "Souther", "interactiveNFT"], "extra": {}}
