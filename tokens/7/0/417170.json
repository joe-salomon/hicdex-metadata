It was warm, but the water ran out almost immediately. we went and went ... I wanted to drink terribly and there was little left to the top, and behind it was a spring, a place where rivers are born.\n \nSuddenly, after another halt, we barely walked 20 m and fell to the ground. We gathered for a long time, tuned in, now I understand that it was a trance, we seemed to be stuck for an hour.\n\nAt some point, 3 girls came down from the top. I looked at my father and realized that he would not ask for help. Then I greeted the girls and asked if they knew where to look for water. They gave us 2 liters of water. It was the most delicious water!\n\nThen the forces returned to us very quickly, we took the top and stopped at the source.\n\nI am 28 years old now, I have seen high mountains, swam in cold lakes and rivers, drank water from glaciers, but I always remember this gesture.\n\nThank you to these 3 beauties!\n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2019.
