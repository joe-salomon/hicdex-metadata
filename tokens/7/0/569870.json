{"__version": 1, "token_id": 569870, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SLIMPSY", "description": "This is another horizontal syntax crystal similar in shape to the work that's on page 199. SLIMPSY is a combination of three words: slim/limp/flimsy. Now that we have that out of the way, let's dive in and find out what makes this artwork special. As we work our way towards the right of the syntax crystal word pyramid, we can see that all the \"I\"s are yellow in hue, creating almost a dash-like line across the horizon. When we take the meaning of this bizarre monstrosity of a portmanteau, SLIMPSY and apply it to the work itself, we can see a thin, flimsy limp-like yellow line that doesn't really do much. There isn't an drama to the line other than slightly going up on the right. It's boring and that's perfect for this work. Not everything has to be hitting you over the head like a Rolling Stones song. Sometimes you need something a little less interesting to rest your perspective. Some artists are only looking for the high notes. Like jazz, you have look and listen for all the notes; the high, the low, the silence. I live for these moments.
