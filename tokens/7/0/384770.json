You are free to use it however you please. \nMaking this track made me feel like I was walking down the street to get a nice garlic-cheese manakeesh. Not a bodega specialty but it's one of the things I miss the most from Dubai.\n\nPS: Melody is from a splice sample pack, I just made adjustments to my liking. This is an old beat that was sitting in my beats folder.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmabcNrzCu9Dxtw4Kh1WJyB3htaJuhmc6RL81nirYHcgaX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUQjgb1F5WRmFdoRC7BmodzT7ZSbfsG8cWuN3qn7zXn9j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmabcNrzCu9Dxtw4Kh1WJyB3htaJuhmc6RL81nirYHcgaX", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ejH12nPiKqyZntesui1DJLevR5sYA4fTk"], "tags": ["Beats", "By", "Zenshy"], "extra": {}}
