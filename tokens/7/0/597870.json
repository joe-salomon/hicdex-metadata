{"__version": 1, "token_id": 597870, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "WASTERS", "description": "WASTERS is another classic syntax crystal that shows the power of repetition. What makes this slightly unique is how most of the growth within the crystal happens by adding new letters at the backend of each line. (WAS/WAST/WASTE/WASTER/WASTERS) I realized after making this one that I'm not a fan of just adding an \"S\" at the end to just extend the crystal further. Technically, it works within the \"rules\" I've created, but somehow unsatisfactory and slightly repetitive. I included it to illustrate my process and candidly show the less successful attempts. Imagine each work like sketches in a book. Some sketches lead to bigger and better ideas. Some are ideas that didn't pan out. I love making mistakes when creating; just shows me what doesn't work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeaM2W2PUzNJVoYtkjkgSE9BvfTfWp7ch3gaN8knuu3af", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRf9tc2oSHbf1teoSXLVMs7qBbGFuifonXnGrajqcNyH6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeaM2W2PUzNJVoYtkjkgSE9BvfTfWp7ch3gaN8knuu3af", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
