{"__version": 1, "token_id": 156470, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Steal this token", "description": "This is an original source code of an exploit used by a HEN exploiter to steal tokens from the contract. It was used to start the swap which can only be collected by this contract Admin. After NFTs has been collected this contract is able to cancel the swap and send canceled tokens back to attacker. Exploit in simple steps: 1. Send an OBJKT to this contract 2. Use it to create a cheapest swap. Don't worry - no one can buy it besides you. 3. Go and buy 10 of them, even though HEN says there is only one being sold. The rest will be taken from currently opened swaps on the market. 4. Ask this contract to cancel your swap and send you 9 more shiny NFTs This attack was possible because of misused `abs` function (also known as `modulo`) in the `collect` entrypoint. If there is a swap for 1 edition and ask to buy 10, which should fail because of the following calculation: 1 - 10 = -9. But the result was wrapped in modulo, so you not only bought 10 tokens, but original swap was left with 9 tokens to be cancelled and returned back.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf5hvibYJrWBsQBSRy7Y99cA5rLyVi6m8hoRZiZceKZkR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbyRcKZ9Vt2GB5a1UNLcczhLTrWckJXdFC6L8BC9kztXr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf5hvibYJrWBsQBSRy7Y99cA5rLyVi6m8hoRZiZceKZkR", "mimeType": "text/markdown"}], "creators": ["tz1Ndt2zz9eYm5tVNKy3NLDpQeQTHAJYe8Mt"], "tags": ["CODE", "HACK", "EXPLOIT"], "extra": {}}
