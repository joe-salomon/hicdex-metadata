An individual who cannot fulfill the need of belonging is isolated from the society by experiencing the lack of feeling of belonging through effects such as exclusion and alienation. The lack of feeling of belonging creates base for the perception of belonging as a problem. For this reason, these two concepts are considered interrelated. The concept of belonging has been among the main issues of disciplines such as sociology, psychology, and philosophy; it has also been the subject of art in certain periods. Since the state of belonging or non-belonging is related to the spaces, the researches on the field of art were limited to the works that prioritize the concept of space, and the selected works were examined within the scope of space-specific art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdhqYDmp1jKmgX32bdVou9jyZrHK45E4JXm1NwT6L3pLG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVvn3W9CBEVG1rhgjU1ABHAK93MM7CEPmcEgooBNAFRr6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdhqYDmp1jKmgX32bdVou9jyZrHK45E4JXm1NwT6L3pLG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1bxELmi7d3DV7i9weQwUexCfPhCs5nM6Lo"], "tags": ["illustration", "art", "digitalart", "darknft"], "extra": {}}
