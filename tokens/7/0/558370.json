A land of jagged peaks, reaching upward from the heart of the island. A world hidden from most, but discoverable for those with a will for adventure. Few places on our planet possess the mysterious aura of Nuka Hiva. Rising from the ocean in one of the most remote island chains in the world, this land rewards those willing to make the trek. Thousands of miles to the nearest coastline, The Marquesas Islands truly feels like one of the last remaining places on our planet undisturbed from humankind. It's raw, rigid, and demands respect. I watched the setting sun illuminate the flowers overlooking these majestic peaks. In this moment, everything was calm. The only sound was the waves rolling ashore in the distance. No people, no distractions, and Earth in its natural intended state. All that it asks back from us is an unwavering desire to protect it.
