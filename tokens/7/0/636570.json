This Aceh Traditional Heritage was once used to fight against the invaders by Sultan Ali Mughayat Syah, the first Sultan who ruled the Sultanate of Aceh at that time.\nIn addition to being used to fight against the former invaders, Siwah can also be categorized as the result of a traditional carving that is attached to the handle and scabbard of the knife. Then,\nas a piece of jewelry or a companion to traditional traditional clothing that is placed or tucked at the waist. Now, if you want to find this type of Traditional Heirloom like 'Siwah', it is usually only used as jewelry. And because it is used as jewelry, it has been given elements of gold and gems on the handle and scabbard.
