This generative artwork was released as a set of single-edition [1/1] iteration mints (numbered: 1, 2, 3) on Hic Et Nunc by Kenny Vaden. This code-sketch set up 26 sine functions, shifted left or right randomly, which were plotted from the top to the bottom to create interposition depth cues. Each sine wave was drawn, then was covered up with concentric dark gray circles with ex-Gaussian distributed radius sizes centered on the wave coordinates, plotted in random order. Twenty intermediate waves were distorted and drawn between the current major wave and next one, with ~80% filled using a gradient selection based on jittered vertical positions. Interesting gaps formed between the waves of varying opacity, and random shifting applied to the concentric circles also reinforces the sense of chaos. The image dimensions for this file are 16x20 inches and resolution is 300 DPI, which produced a file size below the limit, which provides a higher resolution (more detail) than the original version shown online.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNNZfsoi7zQtBj9ojcwBGb7sFBQSmeUQRjwo3M5JLYRQJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXz9FhWDVWhdsMpVYtjQ3QvmwRnQ2y3CYVq37CtHe4ZSv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNNZfsoi7zQtBj9ojcwBGb7sFBQSmeUQRjwo3M5JLYRQJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bEHdSDNdTTPmuin84c6LWqruepu6a5sc5"], "tags": ["Waves", "Circles", "GenerativeArt", "RCode"], "extra": {}}
