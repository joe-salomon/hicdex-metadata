Using archival images and text copied directly from captions, the pieces highlights how the Filipinos were portrayed as uncivilized and underdeveloped savages and how it contributed to perpetuating a condescending view of their culture. \n\nThe title comes from the caption in one of the images: \"Every day in the week is receiving day with these good natured savages.\"\n\nActual caption on image:\n\"To see the smallest people in the world and to observe the lowest order of human intellect World's Fair visitors in great numbers go to the Negrito Village of the Philippine Reservation. Negritos, little negroes, are the original inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. \n\nThey are barbarians. They have a kind of spirit worship, and all tribes give ceremonial dances. As a rule, they are headhunters. Probably no tribe in the Archipelago can produce such splendid specimens physically.\n\nThe Igorot is one of the most conspicuous races of Northern Luzon. Scientists have declared that with the proper training they are susceptible to a high state of development and unlike the American Indian, will accept, rather than defy, the advance of American Civilization.\"\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicewfiedwmbuvihggk3y3ypov47x66xquq4pu5relyrxauvc44uga", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicewfiedwmbuvihggk3y3ypov47x66xquq4pu5relyrxauvc44uga", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicewfiedwmbuvihggk3y3ypov47x66xquq4pu5relyrxauvc44uga", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2DD5NM27cdQZ4gZMaN3UmE85CJzJKpbWyL"], "tags": ["alterhen", "animation", "philippines", "filipino", "igorot", "stlouis"], "extra": {}}
