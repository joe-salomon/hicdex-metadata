Some are empty-handed, some carry flags, some carry swords. Each one I adapted to the context of the discourse at the time. Has been shown several times, including Undisclosed Territory at Studio Plesungan (2016), Yogyakarta Arts Festival (2017), and Art Central, Hong Kong (2018). Talk itself is the response of all things excessive: discussed, defended, fought. Any excess will be losing its essence. \nOn \"Talk\" there is a figure who talks or defense and struggles. The longer the effort he had, the more foam came out of his mouth. Foam covered the face, head to the body. Over time the figure would be exhausted and stopped the acts. At this point, he realized that what he did, defended, and talked about nothing more than the foam which would soon disappear.\n\nPs: the collector of this artwork has the privilege to invite me to perform a live performance.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYoTaQsd6VGSH1BnaYd6HkitXDBhR5cJSXGAqA551KgH9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQX9H2dE5nvXHPvqDCnPWRwkNrzohkBpRjqq6yD89HisS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYoTaQsd6VGSH1BnaYd6HkitXDBhR5cJSXGAqA551KgH9", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Tzn5Gd4KwutnJv1kV25LkVUMGqCQsRXwM"], "tags": ["talk", "performance", "artperformance", "videoperformance", "foam", "fluxus", "FjKunting", "liveperformance", "collect", "privilege", "hurym", "indonesianartist"], "extra": {}}
