I'm sure, there are many cats that love that sensation too... Besides, he was really liked to hide in a dark place and just show his glowing eyes... That's why, his name is Tanmuk (Tanpa Muka/No Face). The last time I saw him was in 2008... Miss him verymuch", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcbG4yWDDgbpt5D646EY6JCocRHvfpNkbVTVF4arXj5Jb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcbG4yWDDgbpt5D646EY6JCocRHvfpNkbVTVF4arXj5Jb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcbG4yWDDgbpt5D646EY6JCocRHvfpNkbVTVF4arXj5Jb", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SN3LHz9jQCEPGL7iQkMuNFmvfcVepgq7s"], "tags": ["cats", "favorite", "hotbalm", "pet", "memories", "miss", "funny", "moments", "love"], "extra": {}}
