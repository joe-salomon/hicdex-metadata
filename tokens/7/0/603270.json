This vessel is our selves and isn't interesting that the word SELVES and VESSEL are anagrams of each other? Coincidence? Potentially. Is there a deeper meaning? Speculative at best, but we will entertain this fantasy for the sake of conceptual art, why not right? You're already reading. Let's look at the image. Take note of how the non-moving lines are in white and the letters that have shifted are in what appears to be lavender. The lavender lines are hugging and wrapped around the white lines almost symbolizing a symbiotic relationship between SELVES and VESSEL. You can't have one without the other. (well...technically, you can if someone is in a coma, but that's an extreme example.) They are perfect together like Oreo cookies and milk; a match made in heaven.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeTuwz6zTNBbj1HiTpUq9ydJTqbaTVerm4XYVZDd6QCEt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmBmuQ6mLo9acT198siVPpubRYUKEw8xdczmk1RCe5gm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeTuwz6zTNBbj1HiTpUq9ydJTqbaTVerm4XYVZDd6QCEt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
