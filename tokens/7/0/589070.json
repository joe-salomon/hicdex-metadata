Sometime in the late 90's I found Dragonball Z. They would play like 3 episodes in a row late at night and really a single battle could last 3 episodes, so nothing ever finished. I eventually bought all of them on ebay. And now I buy and collect Dragonball Z figures from companies like S.H. Figuarts. Goku will always be my favorite.
