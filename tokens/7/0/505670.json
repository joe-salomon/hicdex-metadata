The incredible beauty and power of the underwater kingdom attract all space travelers who have arrived on the planet without exception. Having figured out how to integrate into the process of RNA work, I went in search of my first real body. I became a fish!\n\nThe life of a fish is beautiful! This is one continuous joy. The joy of being, the joy of free movement, the joy of interaction, the joy of nutrition, the joy of reproduction, the joy of feeling warmth\u2026\n\nI was a fat happy fish. Not for long. One day a cormorant grabbed me, pulled me out of the water and ate me. The last joy in that incarnation was the feeling of flight. How many fish manage to see the ocean from a height? I succeeded... what a joy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmddxpwz1HALS6VE3M81ntHZXVutwVzZnNWTgV7BdyPZpF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbDyS2yKM2XJtT8oBP4wAT9GRv5ZT6dYZSesqAAQgGTez", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmddxpwz1HALS6VE3M81ntHZXVutwVzZnNWTgV7BdyPZpF", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YxuH9J2fMdEQ3wXX5Fi2dfAapsAJkKBiC"], "tags": ["42", "EndlessHistory", "DigitalArt", "Adventure", "ScienceFiction", "Cryptoapostol6", "Cryptoapostol12", "ArtificialIntelligence"], "extra": {}}
