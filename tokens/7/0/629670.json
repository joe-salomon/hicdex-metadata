We wrote our dreams, hopes, and held on to our faith as we fight to survive the year.  \n \nLast year, we somehow learned that being a part of a healthy community is actually very important to our growth-- whether for our art or ourselves as a person.  \n \nWatching each and every one of us learn and grow together became quite a wholesome experience. And as we coalesce, we carry each other with the same objective: We Are Gonna Make It. Let's survive this year!\n\nArtist: Jemala \nTitle: As The Grove Coalesce\nFormat: 44,1Khz 16bit Stereo WAV File \nDuration: 02:27", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmasjh8GfRZhcFqnmJuQdRSY5gqvQsCs46JqoRVPKriXhZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme2k3nD6hdyZyQiRvW4HCXHPZ7Z3C2qaqdoJzyhbpEdUz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmasjh8GfRZhcFqnmJuQdRSY5gqvQsCs46JqoRVPKriXhZ", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz2Ptv8gJFbPDZXMiNiJ9DMpt6tZMJyjJ9Fa"], "tags": ["henradio", "audiovisual", "henmusic", "audionft", "jemala", "ambient", "folk", "electronic", "nftune", "hicetnuncmusic", "nftunes", "nftfilm", "nftaudio", "nftsound", "audio", "hopeful", "cinematic", "contemplative", "meditative", "relaxing", "indonesianmusician", "hicetnuncaudio", "indonesia", "wav"], "extra": {}}
