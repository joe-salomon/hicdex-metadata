It relates to something prior to life itself, rather an impulse, a primordial force, one that penetrates and emanates from everything, living and seemingly non-living beings. It illustrates an invisible force that will endure even after we return to dust, like the sterile soil of the Moon.\n.\nThis 4K animated GIF depicts the result which is conceived from real action with fireworks, a performance that shifts between spontaneity and control.\nTo paint with light in a three-dimensional space is to bring one\u2019s thoughts from unconscious realms into existence, only visible as presented through long exposure photography.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPsg7NJ9FRfMDNGX1rWSfrpySqkADG9x6RnzmC5ZkszsD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPsg7NJ9FRfMDNGX1rWSfrpySqkADG9x6RnzmC5ZkszsD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPsg7NJ9FRfMDNGX1rWSfrpySqkADG9x6RnzmC5ZkszsD", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Uki7n3eDNwTKeNXBhUMEZesDQksKNnEa3"], "tags": ["impermanentsculptures", "lightpainting", "sparkles", "brasilia", "ancientlife", "falsaseringueira", "tree", "treeoflife", "esculturasimpermanentes", "longexposure", "behindthescenes"], "extra": {}}
