Mongoose", "description": "The mycelium once again released me, filling me with energy for a new incarnation.\n\nI was born a mongoose. We had a big family - dad, several moms and many children. \n\nFrom birth, I was not a leader, but I had to become one. Games didn't interest me much. I was very curious and tried to stay close to Dad. So, I became the youngest hunter in our pack. At first I was in support, and eventually I became a presenter. \n\nI enjoyed hunting alone. Rats are interesting, insidious, strong, but very tasty prey. Catching them, I liked the most. Many times in search of rats, I came across snakes. \n\nI wanted to make friends with the first snake. She charmed me. But at one point, when I was relaxed, she rushed at me in an attempt to kill me. I remembered Dad's story about the insidiousness of snakes, dodged, hit her and ran away. \n\nSo, I learned the insidiousness of snakes. Every subsequent snake I met was killed. Snakes are delicious, but it's sickening to eat them.\n\nI loved the nights. Sitting in a tree, I often looked at the stars. Looking at the stars, I met my first female. With all the other females, the first thing I did was sit on the same branch and look at the stars. And a lot of my kids were sitting on that bitch. \n\nAnd I died in a fight with an owl who decided to visit our territory.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcFAgAP48eVFNYj2ZCZfTMDXiZEZDHS6B9EdbFA3DTGJi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZUneRZXWaZvfvfh1XDRx4NeNnhiB1uwxMDn6bJR965nu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcFAgAP48eVFNYj2ZCZfTMDXiZEZDHS6B9EdbFA3DTGJi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YxuH9J2fMdEQ3wXX5Fi2dfAapsAJkKBiC"], "tags": ["42", "EndlessHistory", "DigitalArt", "Adventure", "ScienceFiction", "Cryptoapostol6", "Cryptoapostol12", "ArtificialIntelligence"], "extra": {}}
