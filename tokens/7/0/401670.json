Georgie is a hand raised Eclectus parrot who lives in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nImages in the Avian series are based on social media profile photos of pet Eclectus parrots. The photos have been fed into a custom distortion algorithm, reducing a profile pic to an almost abstract form. \n\nIn the wild, Eclectus parrots are threatened by wild fires and habitat destruction. Their population is also under threat from the illegal wildlife trade as people keep them as pets.  \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNm3SE8HgYfZATGEes7yyekThyBAdBjtLi7Xf2DJ5LC43", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbv6RqLc6cQ7toUMA5PuU7sW6p6AdbJcHhnnggn6Fvi6K", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNm3SE8HgYfZATGEes7yyekThyBAdBjtLi7Xf2DJ5LC43", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1c8YAhhVPDbLEahoxiUS6PFWp8e1w8a7nC"], "tags": ["autoeclectus", "eclectus", "generative", "generativeart", "p5js", "animals", "abstract", "art"], "extra": {}}
