We were doing couch tricks for fun so I asked him to take a photo with my 35mm snapshot camera. Toninho has since passed away but the memory he snapped stayed. I turned pro that year and have been having fun ever since.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTndoTZjKFg9PbrCEeweFVdQ6trd8sDfMtyDXawQTdrya", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNjqu2vw7i9UybT2xhVRNYn7Kq79z4Nr5ZA5fctmmMX1D", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTndoTZjKFg9PbrCEeweFVdQ6trd8sDfMtyDXawQTdrya", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1akFM39bnTEmx31CdSKCPomboRobheyUG8"], "tags": ["skateboard", "floweroflife", "goldenrule", "bobburnquist", "gold", "skateboarding", "divineproportion", "gratitude", "bob", "rebirth", "1976", "goldenratio", "inspiration", "love", "skate", "1010", "sacredgeometry", "burnquist", "808", "1618", "burnquistgold", "1111", "Collectible", "Series", "NewFrontier", "TradingCards", "LimitedEdition", "Certificate"], "extra": {}}
