My Dad loved Rock and somewhere along the ways decided to buy a tonne of guitars (around 100) so that he could make his own guitars and that I could play them then promote them. Pilgrim Guitars was his company that never was.\n\nSee Dad had an accident and caught his hands on a drop saw at work, chopping two of his fingers close to fully off. He had to get surgery to re attach them.\n\nAfter he got back from hospital he has to admit the dream of making guitars was no more and have me the guitars to sell to help renovate our house.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb3acTvw8qa3TeJZ3GWLRh3YvAUViThXn7oUE5f7w7fow", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeGBayiquHzbfshDhpSYN3dj7ecH64y9vjZiSsWS3E6nJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb3acTvw8qa3TeJZ3GWLRh3YvAUViThXn7oUE5f7w7fow", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MNJ7pN1Wuyq1yNQJeFXK3e1va2Z9Jgo1V"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
