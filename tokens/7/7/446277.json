Part magazine, part catalog, part rejected piece of art. It thrives on gathering strength through its extensive collection of eyes, noses, mouths and other random body parts. Mixing and experimenting constantly, this ancient creature's only lust is to add facades to its 'Gallery of Faces'. Your snakish eyes or even my crooked nose might just be next in line to join its next masterpiece.
