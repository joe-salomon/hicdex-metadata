Felt like this movie was underrated as a 80s slasher and wanted to watch it again. Seeing it again, it was an odd movie with an awkard chase scene beetwen tv channels, a soundtrack which is way out of place and very mediocore acting. It is a cute and fun experiment and a nice memory from my childhood.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNfS6We36jd84pbWhoWD3mdHhU3bL1qkuTHUMimUmEKTF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWPRFvHBNCHTmhF7T5nqjTNbaoe2KeBtbKJoCu5ykUiH9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNfS6We36jd84pbWhoWD3mdHhU3bL1qkuTHUMimUmEKTF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LWDEXcb436FHzgNDVCfT9ZQNCuiQAiHKn"], "tags": ["Shocker", "horror", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
