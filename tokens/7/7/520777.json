I used this 16 bars passage as an intro to two of my songs \"Jakarta City Blues\" and \"Give Love Get Love Spread The Love\" both of which you can find on your favorite streaming platforms. I've always wanted to have this intro recorded on a real organ--by a real organist--since it is one of my favorite musical instruments. With this piece of pixel art, I finally did it. \n\nOrgan performed by Abel Boquera.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPJNZZZC2d8bdxuLKaaC7ME1f9goKSGFV18YJvcbDDEGc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYpNj9BGDFucZNsFyxHy1H3vJhB4LVSrYmNBUyWiU9BUD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPJNZZZC2d8bdxuLKaaC7ME1f9goKSGFV18YJvcbDDEGc", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2JY1myQteVFyHuT9bevhP8fePRvProsG1X"], "tags": ["pixelart", "jazz", "organ", "music", "cat", "animation"], "extra": {}}
