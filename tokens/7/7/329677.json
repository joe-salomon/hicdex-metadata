The concept of the series is to bring more awareness to the disturbing status as well as the amazing migration of Monarch Butterflies. Indeed, the Monarch Butterfly is one of North America\u2019s most phenomenal species. As the only butterfly known to make the transcontinental migration, Monarch Butterflies started its annual round-trip migration in Mid-August. It will be migrating from September to October in order to arrive at their \"wintering\" sites in November. It must be noted that No individual Monarch Butterfly completes the entire round-trip journey. It may take from three to five generations to complete the round-trip transcontinental migration of the phenomenal Monarch Butterfly.\n\n  This image was created with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI).
