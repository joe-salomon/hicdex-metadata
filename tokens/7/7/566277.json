{"__version": 1, "token_id": 566277, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BREED", "description": "BREED is a word zipper that combines BE and RED in a similar way to how CABRONES functioned. It's not just two words coming together like IN + PUT = INPUT. This has a layer of difficulty a couple steps up in that we need to cross over the letters. There are plenty of these in English, but to locate them is somewhat illusive at times. To locate these types of words we need to think how a hidden word would operate, meaning focusing on how the letters crossover and dynamically become other words. The key is to make mental filters as a kind of algorithm to search. 1. Look only in relatively short words at first. 2. Look for words that end in a vowel or a consonant that has high adaptability or versatility, meaning letters that can be easily combined with other letters. 3. Experiment with moving various letters back and forth to see what kind of combinations come to you. 4. Take some cannabis edibles. 5. Open your mind to let the full scale and scope of the English language sink in.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPiWp3LcUvj7j7WgxBVAZDdPKUoHocGDMD8sPZGgDyi1e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPxKJhmgBdGbvfkKFGfH568iYfM8JgiCAQV1yDQPAh6Vf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPiWp3LcUvj7j7WgxBVAZDdPKUoHocGDMD8sPZGgDyi1e", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
