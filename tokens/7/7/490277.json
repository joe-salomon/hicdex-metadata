{"__version": 1, "token_id": 490277, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Vessels 161: DONK", "description": "Thanks to a rare mutation in his left eye, Donk is an expert sniper, capable of headshotting a victim from a distance of 4km away \u2013 even if that person has a REALLY small head. Seriously, this guy could headshot a kitten. Though he probably wouldn\u2019t. Or at least, he would charge at least 10% more than his usual fee to do so. OK, 5%.\n\nUnfortunately Donk\u2019s vision in his RIGHT eye is very poor, so he is almost completely useless with any gun that doesn\u2019t have a scope, unless he keeps one eye closed the whole time. This has the side-effect of making people think he\u2019s winking at them as he shoots them, making his victims\u2019 final moments as confusing as they are painful.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPhT226WyjFZex3xBriVP6A7nTw54Jet81YBfCqdWQsgW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbZ7cpJER5XiTdyUixkqfiveNacha9hXs8YkP8B3BjTtU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPhT226WyjFZex3xBriVP6A7nTw54Jet81YBfCqdWQsgW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["Vessels"], "extra": {}}
