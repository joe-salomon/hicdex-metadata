Many years later, when I incorporated 3D modeling into my art practice, I decided to reconstruct this subconscious vision. I started by digitally sculpting my own relics, placing fragments of a 3D scan of my own face alongside 3D scans of death masks and antiquities. I also digitally assembled the background tapestry, remixing medieval tapestries and contemporary rug patterns.
