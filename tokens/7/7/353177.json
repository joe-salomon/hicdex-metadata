I was fortunate enough to have been in Tokyo during a significant national sumo tournament.\n\nMany of the rituals and procedures within sumo descend directly from the Shinto religion. Consequently, sumo is as spiritual as it is athletic. The competition itself takes place within a ring (a dohy\u014d), over which hangs a suspended roof in the style of a shrine. Rules of conduct and etiquette amongst the rikishi (fighters) are strict, as they would be in any place of worship.\n \nColour photograph. 4179\u200a\u00d7\u200a2786 JPEG.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXvzpg7mxWe9zPJqDotDFsZMKDDVgB1AZdr31b9KNRWVE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTT1W8WAfSGUeQqNvVx3BVz6Dg9R8muv5dV2fFUihSRF5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXvzpg7mxWe9zPJqDotDFsZMKDDVgB1AZdr31b9KNRWVE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lrvhdv6vyLETQAVmrnqVdoT5h7LeQ1zC2"], "tags": ["color", "colour", "photogrpah", "japan", "sumo", "shinto", "tournament"], "extra": {}}
