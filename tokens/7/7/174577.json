It advertises a \"Cum bar\" and features nonsensical words that reflect insults against mothers and old fart types like those who run and own the Russian Federation itself. Made in the colors of the Ribbon of St. George, Soviet sovkadrochery (masturbators for the Soviet Union) and Russian nationalists will find this stunning artistic creation \nto be incredibly offensive. The words \"To the day of not-quite-fuckery\" will register against the common salute to the Soviet Victory in World War II or \"The Great Fatherland War.\" This noble victory is still appropriated to justify all sorts of Russian aggression and revanche regionalist bullshit. A hearty salute to those who fought the Nazis, may the Russian propaganda machine respect their sacrifice! Patriots of all nations can understand that the Soviet war against Nazism was the best Soviet achievement and its highest moment as a state and nation. Yuri Gagarin would certainly agree as would Sakharov and probably that monster, Stalin, too. This is part of a series of works that will fund my independent academic research.
