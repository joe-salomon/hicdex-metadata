We step through the looking glass and into the portrait, frozen in time. The camera explores a more intimate relationship with our subject, investigating the details of the cracking paint and subtle light across her face. The form of the girl becomes appended with a blooming floral arrangement, representing the passing of time with something that is timeless, nature.
