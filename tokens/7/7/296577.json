Like all animals they need care and attention to grow and thrive throughout our lives. The message is clear:\n\n>>> Treat your body like the champion organism that it is <<<\n\nI was introduced to the idea of Centaurs of Attention by David Sitek whose wantonly masterful digital audio manipulations with TV On The Radio inspired the collage nature of all these images (and provided the soundtrack for much of their creation). This poster was guest colored/collaged by my partner in HappySleepy, Magda Wojtyra.\n\nImage Description: Pen and ink drawing with digital collage colouring - image says, \"I Am My Own Prize Winning Animal\" and shows a half man, half white lion centaur holding a banner with a blue ribbon that says \"Centaur of Attention - 1st Prize\" and he is swatting and destroying tiny purple man creatures in a green field with a colorful circle of power behind him, against a blue sky.\n\nI Am My Own Prizewinning Animal is the 3rd NFT in the  MemeSwarm Redux 2021 collection\n\n>>> About Meme Swarm Redux 2021 <<<\nThese psychedoodlic haikus were created for a group exhibit called Gene Swarm curated by Rupert Bottenberg and held at Le Kop Shop, Montreal, Canada, during November 2006. The participants were Luke Ramsey, Billy Mavreas, Rupert Bottenberg and Marc Ngui.\n\n<<< Semantic Background >>>\n\nGene Swarm is a term gleaned from one of Terence Mckenna's many monologues. It refers to the flow of genetic information on the earth over millennia as it would be perceived by a consciousness capable of observing events unfolding over extremely long time scales.\nMckenna's point was that individual species (nevermind individuals) would exist only as flickers of flesh while the genetic information would be the continuous elements combining and recombining, dancing each other in and out of prominence as environments changed and evolutionary forces selected the most appropriate combinations. This idea of observing evolution at a bio-molecular level over geologic time seems to have been impossible until the 20th century.\nThe title Meme Swarm was generated when gene was switched to meme as a way of emphasizing information content over biological processes.\n\n>>> About the Creation Process <<<\n\nEach image was first drawn with ink on paper, scanned at a high resolution and digitally coloured and collaged. Many images use classical and famous paintings as backgrounds and these are noted below. Other elements used include personal photographs and images gleaned off the web, also noted below, and patterns and textures generated specifically for this project.\nThey have been remastered and generally improved for their NFT debut.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeid5pm7q5tj3vfstpn27qrgtahs3cki2x3mlyyu7dyimcwswfypsfu", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibmcv4qagii57cm45os555zjorfriwqxs3owokq3evrovykpwaq7m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeid5pm7q5tj3vfstpn27qrgtahs3cki2x3mlyyu7dyimcwswfypsfu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NTY6Prmq4er4RXkGSwGCfjUjkfgyTMR67"], "tags": ["Centaur", "cat", "monkey", "DavidSitek", "MagdaWojtyra", "digitalart", "penandink", "comics", "psychedelic", "firstprize", "prizewinning", "animal", "body", "selfcare", "TvOnTheRadio", "collage", ""], "extra": {}}
