I am a free being a unique individual with nothing to hide. Committed to diving into the depths of my mind. Merging in high intensity with my daemons, burning in the fiery forge of truth.\n\nI am relentless destruction, unmaking your paradigm. Run, chase, pursue the thin air, grab it with your hands, exhort yourself. What do you see? your breath is free. Don't think, just listen silently, the humming sound of stars grinding far far away, in a distant massive blackhole. I've been there and came out the other side as thin air, the air you breathe, dance with me let's chase this endless highway to its end and further. No speed limit, we'll ride so fast our ghostly worries will peel off and never catch us.\n\nI felt it all at once, every particle of my body blasted away by the blazing lights, I kept on feeling till there was nothing left to feel. Where am I now? The black hole kept on humming its song and I kept on listening. I was there, and everywhere else, all at once. Walking on nothing, no body attached. This is how it feels like to be no one.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmccWJPmWUPukpFYS88hb8jfBKo1TJWz5Dmqn6b5KN3Zrz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZZ4uVVSHfKeb2pP9SSKeJeV3GquceYJBEv2S9WcS64qr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmccWJPmWUPukpFYS88hb8jfBKo1TJWz5Dmqn6b5KN3Zrz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Uo5Aufk4ewh9CJFQiAyHyVC7wdGY5yEQG"], "tags": ["desire", "light", "love", "peace", "experiment", "joy", "transcendence", "human", "being", "soul", "spirit", "mind", "dematerialisation"], "extra": {}}
