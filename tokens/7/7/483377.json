Before that, I was dabbling lightly and felt like I was on the outside. \n\nI really like how democratic it is here on HEN. Granted, you need to have some kind of computer and aptitude, but it's about as level a playing field as is out there right now. As a result, you can find all kinds of art from artists around the world, and some that seem like they may be from another one. It's helped to loosen me up, not to take myself too seriously, and to create whatever I feel like. \n\nWhich, admittedly, is horny nerd art. Which is great. \n\nMy foray into OBJKT creation is also a means of generating the funds necessary to grow my own NFT collection.
