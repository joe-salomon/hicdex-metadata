The movement, which campaigned for votes for middle-class, property-owning women and believed in peaceful protest, had quite the connection to beauty. As these women fought for their rights, red lipstick became a part of their uniform. The bold and dauntless red was feminine, yet daring and powerful. It became symbolic of strength during a time when men were trying to strip that away from women.
