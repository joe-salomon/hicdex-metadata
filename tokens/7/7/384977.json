But they need me. I chose to help them. Is it okay if I am who's not okay now?\"\n\nI saw him, had a really terrible sleep cycle, baggy eyes, that curvy back, subtle grip, tiny little smile hiding his pain.\n\nTo all the fellow front liners, this artwork is for you. You guys are really bringing the lights they need, lighten their cave to show a path guiding them to the state they used to be.\n\nWhen you walk through the door, they see a living creatures full of hope.\n\nThank you <3", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVuJhZvXpJ52NWvvhzGRSsdHc25Au3ABFwiNybouoid8c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS3AVa5PBYdPkU8R9Ajh5xZkAK6qgLHRZfZdPfCfQUAMb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVuJhZvXpJ52NWvvhzGRSsdHc25Au3ABFwiNybouoid8c", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1U6qjwq26iNDHJHUgL7nqbxn5QyaymfYsn"], "tags": ["coronavirus", "covid", "corona", "3d", "visualization"], "extra": {}}
