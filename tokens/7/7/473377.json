For roughly the same reasons I don't go to exhibitions, museums, etc.\nI think the value of an original is high, only if that original has something in it that copies don't have. Something that will give the owner something more than the visual that can be seen from the replicas.\nLike a secret cipher on the back, or a \"second reading\" that can be seen under certain lighting, because the original was written in special ink, let's say.\n\nEither I'm just too tired and still haven't found the strength to try myself on the sites)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7ooBkfaxjit7g7zLrSCVfZv9WZ6HhAEHCse4M15N4yn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYqe5fP3oC6itq9iGD48yKNi5uUtoi9QakbfyvS9vF8UF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf7ooBkfaxjit7g7zLrSCVfZv9WZ6HhAEHCse4M15N4yn", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cgT6gJt2YBBP4R9vnSYBaxre8E3PNk6wn"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
