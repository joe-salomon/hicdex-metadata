When I was walking down the street in Midtown Manhattan after installing my work at the Spring Break / Art Show I saw this dead bird on the sidewalk. It always makes me sad to see birds on the sidewalk trampled by pedestrians. But there\u2019s something romantic and beautiful in the body of something that used to fly. So I attempt to try to illustrate it with a little bit of life. In the original image you can\u2019t see the eye. I would add the photos here but it\u2019s too heartbreaking of the actual bird. This NFT is made from paper mache sculptures of water towers. I use recycled materials as a base. Some of these I put out as street art around New York City. But you won\u2019t find them unless you look up.
