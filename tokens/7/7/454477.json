Each work is a unique 1/1 that explores a different theme. For the third piece in this series, my robot's GANs were trained on only female punks, then it painted a stylized portrait of what emerged in it's imagination. A controversial aspect of CryptoArt is gender disparity. Some believe it exists, as I do. Others strongly object to its existence, and think any mention of gender is simply an attempt to inject unwanted politics into crypto culture. When I first trained my GANs on CryptoPunks, time after time it would produce only male punks. I looked into why and discovered that less than 40 percent of CyrptoPunks were female. I do not know if this means anything in general, but it meant something to my algorithm.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbvCNo3x4Rmt856i1WPCHADS2kVVSJL8bSu1sLuarzfbT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWiaJNjwTABfAWTiVyvtSofxMG9TdXS8nMBT1CNvMZ7PA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbvCNo3x4Rmt856i1WPCHADS2kVVSJL8bSu1sLuarzfbT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XxKth27unh1zquuKNTehQhUr5M5CHPf3e"], "tags": ["ai", "aiart", "artonomous", "cryptopunks", "gan", "robot", "robotart", "robotpainting"], "extra": {}}
