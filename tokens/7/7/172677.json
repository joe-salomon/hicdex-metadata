Please Stand By, Schools Are Erasing White Guilt. The debate over how to teach the history of race in America is entangling local school boards and engulfing national politics. In recent months, Republican governors in Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas have signed bills designed to restrict the way history is taught or ban the use of Critical Race Theory, passing legislation that prohibits the teaching of anything that may make a student feel bad about themselves. \u00a0Under a bill that was proposed in Arizona, teachers could have been fined $5,000 for teaching students to feel \u201cguilt\u201d over their race. These lawmakers want to create a Disney World image of American History, essentially a history of lies by omission. Ibram X. Kendi, author of\u00a0How to Be an Antiracist,\u00a0finds the idea that classroom explorations of racism are divisive to be ironic. \u201cIf we\u2019re not teaching students that the reason why racial inequity exists is because of racism, then what are they going to conclude as to why racial inequity exists? They\u2019re going to conclude that it must be because those Black people must have less because they are less,\u201d Kendi says. \u201cThat\u2019s the only other conclusion. Not teaching our kids about racism is actually divisive.\u201d\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRnkhDZ8nWFRMZW6LUCP1uaUamTg6dsVL7fsvtaoNDh2e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNrLTLGU2pbm4rRZ54odMgZV37DN4NM66TesmoTK5BNdq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRnkhDZ8nWFRMZW6LUCP1uaUamTg6dsVL7fsvtaoNDh2e", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["digital", "art", "digitalart", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "TV", ""], "extra": {}}
