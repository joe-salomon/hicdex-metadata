During this era of civil unrest and anti-war protests in Austin, the Ku Klux Klan received permission to march in a pro-Vietnam war demonstration. They were received by a largely peaceful but quite vocal opposing group of citizens and students during this moment in history. This photo shows a close-up look at one of the members of the \"green shirts\", the Klan security team, during the march. Taken with a Praktica FX2 camera on 35mm Kodachrome film.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWrSvWypP6jT6q251wjgiWEMSBVJ9in9XuEgxqF19ryDd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWDqGsxMtZTRNTVK5PBUunJAv29oxjMtrn8ep3cN73tnn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWrSvWypP6jT6q251wjgiWEMSBVJ9in9XuEgxqF19ryDd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YmwJZfEerVMbc8uuJc7xUzE64ma3Xfu7L"], "tags": ["KKK", "Klan", "Clan", "history", "protest", "Vietnam", "Austin", "Texas", "series", "peace", "60\u2019s", "civilrights", "anti-war", "city", "1965", "march", "black", "lives", "matter", "blm", "white", "supremacy", "security", ""], "extra": {}}
