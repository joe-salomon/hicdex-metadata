The # Infinite Frames # collection was created as an attempt to work around this problem, since most of the community doesn't have supercomputers, including me. The launching sequence of each piece will be 1 live generative mint, then 3 of my favorites psychedelic frames from the live generative piece. Most will be free or gifted, so enjoy! Feel free to collect, but I would like to politely ask each user to limit yourself to collecting only 1 edition of each frame, giving opportunity to others.\n\n3200x3200 pixels | PNG", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPcWf4Wu5cGD8YfG1xp9QK5T2E88eKVoKf7WQu6QkdF4f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdVDTPZtRHaebdEPDCmEsXE3hDhTSSStLpnoxgDQzH8gR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPcWf4Wu5cGD8YfG1xp9QK5T2E88eKVoKf7WQu6QkdF4f", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tzuh1jqMSUz6Y3PCRUrF1LcPqi1x82N6r"], "tags": ["generative", "frame", "mandala", "psychedelic", "magiccircle", "temenos", "generatrip", "trip", "stoner", "weed", "lsd", "dmt", "high", "free", "giveaway", "hydrasynth", "visualsynthesis", "giveaway", "0xtz", "fractal"], "extra": {}}
