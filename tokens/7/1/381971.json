This is a typical value for a presumed planet of a main-sequence star,\nbut it is nevertheless considerably larger than the mass of the star implies. \nCertain exoplanets receivea small mass deduction, meaning that their mass is associated with that of another object or objects.\nWith the inclination of the \"Verotas system\", this deduction is reminiscent of that of \"NN Serpentis\". \nAt the time of discovery, it had the longest orbital period of any directly imaged exoplanet.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNPUVmxb4dG2ZTPNM3wAwL8FLSC11nFJ1ZRMHiPWczhgC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcmDXiwT1nfGhjCb8vrHQUYB3ZGHCwQAfQKc4G45zUpAM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNPUVmxb4dG2ZTPNM3wAwL8FLSC11nFJ1ZRMHiPWczhgC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ivd4FpLFp6aZjRu5y4WwU6fsCBnCSNvk6"], "tags": ["planet", "space", "galaxy", "universe", "cosmos"], "extra": {}}
