This demon is only formed from a head without a body. Kala Rau is immortal because he participates in drinking Tirta Amerta (water of immortality) while disguised as a God at that time. When Kala Rau drank Tirta Amerta, Lord Vishnu discovered his disguise. Because Tirta Amerta had reached Kala Rau's throat, Lord Vishnu released his arrow which caused Kala Rau's head to break off and then floated in the sky.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPgxQuGmSaiRG1XMq8qJt5M4FcoyXXuu83yTms5dKnziy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVCG6yr8oJTq9A6PHYTY3fPRbRqi5U3DyaGKF3JBsksw9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmd9KMSeYupap8mMvf1oTDk3j8TqxftSDBKqvbfW54gDS1", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPgxQuGmSaiRG1XMq8qJt5M4FcoyXXuu83yTms5dKnziy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hwBtq7pTnf5EsmuvMFHdNSKeqUAeGdKbf"], "tags": ["chibi", "kawaii", "cute", "barong", "bali", "japan", "illustration", "digitalart", "character"], "extra": {}}
