This is #11, so there will be 2 more designs in this series, and THAT'S IT! DONE! (Maybe I'll do a different series afterwards...or maybe not. We'll see...) This design was something I drew in a notebook, photographed, and then tweaked and colored with a free app on my phone. It's bright and weird and cartoony, and I'm cool with all of that. Maybe you will be too? ---Richard F.
