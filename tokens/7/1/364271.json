Each number corresponds to a title, which in actual fact is a line from a poem written especially for the occasion by Francesco Leonetti, and a price tag.\n\n\nThe prices are provocatively different from one another, and the single objects, once placed on individual pedestals, become aesthetically pleasing, thus reduced to pure exhibitive value, as if to say \u2018the object appears to be sale-able if the ideology is not apparent, if it looks \u2018nice\u2019, if it has varying prices\u2019.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSvUyZncCeCjGAVqBGebsab3gz9DhrWfimarVNWNJkq2A", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPe2WpLwTu58ouTicXVkynVaZbTBjLUgbW3k9Ea51J3Xg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSvUyZncCeCjGAVqBGebsab3gz9DhrWfimarVNWNJkq2A", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SLNVkcr3fPmAgWi4oWC9GhoGKY6brTeEq"], "tags": ["photo", "leon", "italiandesign", "sickleandhammer", "mari"], "extra": {}}
