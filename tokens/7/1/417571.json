{"__version": 1, "token_id": 417571, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Birds of many feathers flock alone", "description": "Part of the Feathered Tales collection gradually releasing on Hicetnunc. The collection arises from my love and fascination with birds and will feature works in different media (as well as hybrids) that I have been doing for several years. \n\nThis piece is a combination of analog mixed media (watercolor, markers, ink, coffee) and digital drawing and painting. \"Birds of many feathers flock alone\" symbolizes the need of a multidimensional being for solitude and unique expression, going deep into oneself and beyond the noise. Yet there is a kind of community in this as well, as the need and urge for solitude is shared by other such beings. It is in a sense flocking in spirit, each in the depths of own infinities from which we draw new expressions and creations. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTSSj8iknPBLKPvrzWmrc2dXZPKs6GpDYmRbqdBGRWznZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd8ZnXAfbS199rWjEJ4YBJLKH83uXqExfKhZ4c5rJ5Fe5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTSSj8iknPBLKPvrzWmrc2dXZPKs6GpDYmRbqdBGRWznZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TqDPZMv4bq1WsnJrddopnXhXbwTV8DFwS"], "tags": ["bird", "illustration", "drawing", "mixedmedia", "digitalart", "mythology", "storytelling", "collection", "animals", "animalpower"], "extra": {}}
