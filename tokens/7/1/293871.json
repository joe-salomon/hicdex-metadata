{"__version": 1, "token_id": 293871, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNFOLDINGS - Hypercube 05 / BLACK METAL", "description": "Unfolding of a hypercube lattice obtained through graph algebra operations (Cartesian product) from the basic primitive - path graph with two nodes (which unfolds into a line). Simulation is based on Fruchterman and Reingold's method for force-directed placement of nodes which includes both attraction (between nodes connected with edges) as well as repulsion (between all nodes). This piece was produced as an experiment in computational design research on lattice algebras.\n\n#OBJKT4OBJKT\n#OBJKT4OBJKT3\n\n@lukapiskorec, mp4, 1000 x 1000 pix, 200 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigqz26gp7ztz2eq6lwjfxesoqiwtnqo5dldee2s36z3ikipfplrpq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifyvuzwzqugblrem7whjpqyz6gldkopecrfztxdtadfhqdz3u7mke", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigqz26gp7ztz2eq6lwjfxesoqiwtnqo5dldee2s36z3ikipfplrpq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Lkgy2gYECvVK55yyiwjbSSZeUoQp8Azxo"], "tags": ["lattice", "sculpture", "procedural", "generative", "algorithmic", "computational", "animation", "3D", "structure", "organic", "crystal", "geometric", "abstract", "architectural", "design", "graph", "matrix", "algebra"], "extra": {}}
