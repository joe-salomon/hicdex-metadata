He introduces his works which are characterized by bold and dramatic colors and impulsive and expressive brush strokes (Impasto technique).\nFor this work, I combined the image of the Fluxcup (segmented popular character) as a canvas with several well-known figures in the art world. Vincent Van Gogh on Fluxcup, as an idea of being a surface. Where I replaced the flat canvas shape with a Fluxcup-shaped bust figure. In this work, I also cultivate the technical character of a maestro's work by imitating Vincent Van Gogh's impasto by collaborate with a painter to do this technique.\n\nIn this work, together with Anindito Wisnu, a BUMN employee and painting as his hobby. The painting is good. Very good.
