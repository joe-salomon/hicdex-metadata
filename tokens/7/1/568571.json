The picture was taken on an early morning flight in a hot air balloon in the stunning Cappadocian landscape.  The camera lens captured both the amazing view of Cappadocia and the shadow of the balloon blooming in the mountains, and a detective with a handbag and a hat, who watches what is happening from the side, we will see you find him :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXeGdwndPXfb8gTPRAttkNjteG5L1ZoPjikd4SVDrMDD4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWVizZesQ91mcEqrUmh7U23X7zbJ8scizqdecCGn4q1cV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXeGdwndPXfb8gTPRAttkNjteG5L1ZoPjikd4SVDrMDD4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Vp57uiqyeqKrUEUsRkp3ZY1i98pYJ5V2g"], "tags": ["Travel"], "extra": {}}
