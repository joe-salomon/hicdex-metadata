One chapter has 4 of these episodes. Why am I doing it like this you ask? Well, I\u2019m only a single person working on this webcomic, plus it\u2019s a better motivator for me to post weekly! If you want to know more about Arche or want to see some behind the scenes content (or what other nft i\u2019m working on on the side), please check out my twitter @feireina \n\nLot\u2019s of love,\nFei\n\n\nSummary:\nTo prevent his elemental powers from being sealed before he graduates, Noah needed to do one thing, Summon a companion to aid him. What he did not expect is for his companion to be a demon. His professors are definitely going to fail him now.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTmPuqpuSyUzJ6pTixjHhdeo8pzDbvUU6m1tzbjt1TKyt", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmezq8jk9Hf6AShNqScyb7zkt2U7JMjn6DCu5AnUudMDqK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTmPuqpuSyUzJ6pTixjHhdeo8pzDbvUU6m1tzbjt1TKyt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2BFvEhAFWVgh4B6sEnXEx7VFZYJTwegQHm"], "tags": ["arche", "webcomic", "webtoon", "video", "manga", "anime", "magic", "school", "story"], "extra": {}}
