Gonna be going into the MV just to chill and do stuff.\n\nThe painting that the meta friends are in is a physical painting I made earlier this year, maybe last year.  I took a picture of it and changed it digitally to get a different look.\n\nAnd the other painting is a digital painting I made this year.  Was gonna make it into an nft by itself.  And just ended up adding it to this nft.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude42 \ud83d\ude42\n\n\ntwitter:  @nftabstract\ninstagram:  @nft_abstract\n\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmatyBThXpdDLjCYs3p1oFWHXDiUKicYHUYrnonwAGWKex", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVagL7RymLFghqaXmB6G2HYzybkaWoEXpzuGvRf9UYtac", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmatyBThXpdDLjCYs3p1oFWHXDiUKicYHUYrnonwAGWKex", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UykKygruBbnuNPRwXCYPu4P9vzQVTYgeX"], "tags": ["friends", "frens", "meta", "metaverse", "buddies", "community", "nft", "crypto", "art", "artwork", "painting", "3d", "virtualreality", "virtualworlds", "floaty", "floatyfrens", "floatyfriends", "lightfriends", "lightfriends", "tezos", "xtz", "tez", "vr", "ar", "virtualreality", "augmentedreality", "fun", "editions", "digitalgoods", "nft", "nft's", "nfts", "crypto", "cryptocurrency", "physiverse", "blockchain", "frensaverse", "metalife", "metaliving"], "extra": {}}
