Each of these sketches will be sold as an affordable 1/1 NFT.  Distant Lands are over there, never here. You cannot touch the distance.. the sounds of far, die before they reach your ears.. your eyes can barely see, through the thick crust of your ideas. Only your mind can roam freely over distant lands", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb3sXs8eP5keBCKri8qHCbKyJvBxgrEck6QA787GLdSqJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYMcA71pYxvbjjJChhHpmiizCYpsHonNE5PmbstCoL48b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb3sXs8eP5keBCKri8qHCbKyJvBxgrEck6QA787GLdSqJ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gEF1QwG2hhgQLXDPcURPYxMXaPRfixJRP"], "tags": ["sketch", "birds", "azbeen", "landscape", "whimsical", "fly", ""], "extra": {}}
