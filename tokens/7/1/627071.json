I illustrate these bastions of our cultural heritage with a stylistic key that represents me. These first 3 designs are the beginning of a collection that over time I intend to extend paying tribute to the most acclaimed animals.\n\nThe Giant Anteater\n(Rare 24 editions)\n\nIt is one of the most primitive animals that inhabits the soil in all of South America. In Argentina we have the largest anteater of all the subspecies. It is a toothless animal that uses its tongue to consume more than 35 thousand ants per day. It is an adorable creature, although with its claws it can seriously harm anyone who dares to disturb it.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRtSW2sxARxZMGqfRAVpGL5kDVnwPtqqoaLmDWTGkfBYS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW3AxfvuTp3vVnGymgkbZSTm1tgfEzVY7WgKLt2n9mEp9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRtSW2sxARxZMGqfRAVpGL5kDVnwPtqqoaLmDWTGkfBYS", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2PefDbra1nQXTtTk58PPn6m6HYJDmj2WR5"], "tags": ["ANIMALS", "SIMBIONTE_ARTE", "GIANTANTEATER", "ART"], "extra": {}}
