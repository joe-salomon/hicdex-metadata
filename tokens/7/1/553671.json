It dreams of being seen.\n\nThe snowy mountains in the background are borrowed from - North Shore, Baffin Island I (1925 - 1935) -  by my favourite group of seven artist, Lawren Harris. The hovering spirit features tattoos inspired by Beneath the Great Wave by Hokusai.\n\nImage description: Pen and ink drawing with digital collage colouring - image says, \"I Am Extremely Grateful for the Fact that You Are Aware of how I Appear to You in Your Dreams\" in a script font and shows a brightly colored spirit helper with full body tattoos talking to a golden boy representation of the spirit of a polar bear asleep on a rocky outcropping on the shores of an arctic lake.\n\n I Am Extremely Grateful for the Fact That You Are Aware of How I Appear to You in Your Dreams is the 8th NFT in the  MemeSwarm Redux 2021 collection\n\n>>> About Meme Swarm Redux 2021 <<<\nThese psychedoodlic haikus were created for a group exhibit called Gene Swarm curated by Rupert Bottenberg and held at Le Kop Shop, Montreal, Canada, during November 2006. The participants were Luke Ramsey, Billy Mavreas, Rupert Bottenberg and Marc Ngui.\n\n<<< Semantic Background >>>\n\nGene Swarm is a term gleaned from one of Terence Mckenna's many monologues. It refers to the flow of genetic information on the earth over millennia as it would be perceived by a consciousness capable of observing events unfolding over extremely long time scales.\nMckenna's point was that individual species (nevermind individuals) would exist only as flickers of flesh while the genetic information would be the continuous elements combining and recombining, dancing each other in and out of prominence as environments changed and evolutionary forces selected the most appropriate combinations. This idea of observing evolution at a bio-molecular level over geologic time seems to have been impossible until the 20th century.\nThe title Meme Swarm was generated when gene was switched to meme as a way of emphasizing information content over biological processes.\n\n>>> About the Creation Process <<<\n\nEach image was first drawn with ink on paper, scanned at a high resolution and digitally coloured and collaged. Many images use classical and famous paintings as backgrounds and these are noted below. Other elements used include personal photographs and images gleaned off the web, also noted below, and patterns and textures generated specifically for this project.\nThey have been remastered and generally improved for their NFT debut\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSBZF8bPCKQfRSm2oDHxJmfH3k9emLUHMHZqZyi4WTbfk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdeAxxxomgHWEMhHsAJYtHSeh7NFLGQRszSeF9Y37cPjT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSBZF8bPCKQfRSm2oDHxJmfH3k9emLUHMHZqZyi4WTbfk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NTY6Prmq4er4RXkGSwGCfjUjkfgyTMR67"], "tags": ["Polarbear", "sleeping", "dreaming", "lake", "glacier", "LawrenceHarris", "GroupofSeven", "goldenchild", "friendlyspirit", "flying", "selfrealization", "comics", "psychedelic", "handlettering", "memeswarmredux2021", "marcngui", "drawing", "penandink", "digitalcolour", "collage", "psychedelic"], "extra": {}}
