In the Early Dynastic period and the Old Kingdom, he enjoyed a preeminent (though not exclusive) position as lord of the dead, but he was later overshadowed by Osiris. His role is reflected in such epithets as \u201cHe Who Is upon His Mountain\u201d (i.e., the necropolis), \u201cLord of the Sacred Land,\u201d \u201cForemost of the Westerners,\u201d and \u201cHe Who Is in the Place of Embalming.\u201d", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRnrLANR54Nm8ZBV2M1uHAyzKdGvNyC2wVFCupzWv1xPv", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme5UMj5iJpUbH7ve2AtLYBSTfVxUA5op8ndLZRYdm8uqg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRnrLANR54Nm8ZBV2M1uHAyzKdGvNyC2wVFCupzWv1xPv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TwwGAsjFWcsK7G5DBYiZ7tHKrAHBcX11v"], "tags": ["Illustration", "Anubis", "LOWTRUST", "Sushi", "Character", ""], "extra": {}}
