But what was my surprise when I saw Katiuscha, Germs's cat, talking to the rats. I thought she was kicking out the rats forever. But Voidkross warned me that they intended to team up, to rob me. Along with Mr. Weedy, Voidkross devised a surefire way to save me. Katiuscha and the rats stole my money and a bag of marijuana. However, they didn't know that they hadn't taken the actual Mondrian bag of infinite marijuana, which remained with me. I lost everything but my most important item, my Mondrian bag. Since I still have friends in the multiverse, Shed asked me to live in one of his cryptovoxel parcels. Now I'm actually protected from further attacks from these animals, but I'm going to have to rebuild my entire fortune again. The multiverse awaits me!
