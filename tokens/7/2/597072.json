Assets created by Metsa, both audio and visual, inspired and were used in this piece.\n\nHere you will find a combo of photography, 3d modeling, game development(in Unreal Engine), sound design and production and audioreactive tech. \n\nIn the custom loop I composed for this competition, 2 edits of audio samples, provided by Metsa, layered with foley samples trigger 2 respective video assets he also provided. His audio glitch samples inspired the glitch effects on the already audio driven sculptures created in Unreal Engine, controlled separately by the drum and bass tracks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmamtsEWnG4swxrz8qqEE37B7yYTSkfrkqdzcar7roto7v", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXh4TbL2UY6VC8FXLashcb1NsrTgKdGNoVaaowF8V4rmu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmamtsEWnG4swxrz8qqEE37B7yYTSkfrkqdzcar7roto7v", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PiSa9rfX5JAQ8CpuhuYpohY8CUzzGYFkc"], "tags": ["audiovisual", "unrealengine", "audioreactive", "genesis", "tarekwayne"], "extra": {}}
