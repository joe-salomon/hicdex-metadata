These works explore the idea that we all are resonating connected strings. That everything is. A tribute to generative as a concept. Strings with different resonating modes generate space and time, and everything therein. These are just lines rotating at different angular velocities.\n\nA generative artwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro.\n\nMade with Processing, 900x900px looping mp4.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdpaqJVjNHJdn2cW2fMuCc6C3Ubxx24WQYRpD55fzKUcp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdcNQ8BDS2r9MhsphvKHzC49wccY3BuF85AxHcUzCN6F9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdpaqJVjNHJdn2cW2fMuCc6C3Ubxx24WQYRpD55fzKUcp", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eCX4smQ3LbxwDR3pqNoLQvNNKiHJtpwYz"], "tags": ["artxcode", "generative", "geometricart", "codeart", "genart", "minimalist", "iillucid", "generativeart", "polylines", "loop", "video"], "extra": {}}
