{"__version": 1, "token_id": 302972, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Spirit of the Doors", "description": "Nkuyu, also called Lucero Mundo or Nkuyo is regarded as the most important mpungu (deity) among the other deities in Palo Mayombe. He is the god of woods, crossroads, and wilderness. Lucero in Spanish means lightning (Morning Star). The lightning also represents the descend of a spirit to the earth.\n\nNkuyu is the one that travels the paths and roads. He is believed to be the deity who shuts and opens doors. He is known as the divine messenger. He sees everything and no spiritual energy can be accessed without him.\n\nTherefore, he is first acknowledged in every rite or ceremony. He is said to be the first to receive the mysteries of the Supreme Deity, Nzambi. His personality is so revered that that alongside with Zarabanda, must have individual shrines dedicated to them by any Tata of Palo Mayombe. \n\nNkuyu is associated with balance and guidance. He is also known for his wisdom through which he guides men. He is said to be tricky, fickle and mischievous like a child. He can also play the role of fierce defenders, contending strongly with his enemies.\n\nreference:https://www.palomayombeorg/lucero-of-palo-mayombe-the-spirit-of-the-doors/ \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigkcycnkleqybittrqouzkuvcbdktpqc6dncxm7mmg7nbv3pu32xy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreictxztnqltqj4nslldofdndxxjx4tth5byrj7gxufqjcnyo4vnytu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreigkcycnkleqybittrqouzkuvcbdktpqc6dncxm7mmg7nbv3pu32xy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PTbafFgKp7irKbGsxwVtkUiYWNNF2ajmj"], "tags": ["lucero", "luceromundo", "nkuyu", "nkuyo", "mayombe", "palomayombe", "Spirits", "Voodoo", "Blackmagick"], "extra": {}}
