In fact, the main function of the wind deflectors has been to direct the outside air into the building, to cool it relatively and to establish a natural air flow in the workplace and for people to live in different cities and places. These reservoirs have also been used. Iran is one of the countries that, due to the type of architecture and its climate, especially in the southern cities and the desert, has used windbreaks in different shapes and sizes. The space windbreak complex is a new human habitation in unknown galaxies that I have always dreamed of, inspired by traditional architecture and windbreaks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcTphGhNJZXaWSGtpMaVrbgqwVYhddsiW6qAArpdb1YLq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPewyAqRC713UyVmWU2PRAi7LcNny47YPtjPFXhhxKR3a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcTphGhNJZXaWSGtpMaVrbgqwVYhddsiW6qAArpdb1YLq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bRfYU1PkghFqyFEtWHz5vLPZBpLUuPQ2h"], "tags": ["HDaO", "nftcollector", "random", "objkt4objkt", "witches", "painting", "animation", "giveaways", "3dmotion", "2d", "cleannfts", "demons", "alterhen", "henpro", "art", "evil", "tezos", "hicetnunc", "tezosart", "digitalart", "sales", "2D", "generative", "3d", "nftart", "calligraphy", "colorfull", "nftcollection", ""], "extra": {}}
