All of these poor little babies seem to be dangerous, weird or ugly with an instant judgement, but if you look closely, with more time and effort to really understand and know these babies, lies fear underneath them, terrified of others. Imagine how it feels having constant pain and itch in the back of your head but you can't see nor understand where it comes from\u2026 that\u2019s how my babies feel. \n\nPlease take good care of them and give them a better home to heal their traumas.\n\nvisual:.glb", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaFwwALA286wWm8ounFB458zug3gsGuCbM8XprQv2Fn8g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWpJKyEsbWeUw5fMEJxBg67EVRaV1LZpLyfNYrBdRw13M", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaFwwALA286wWm8ounFB458zug3gsGuCbM8XprQv2Fn8g", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1ieBNmLPyaW2kZGYh7E7RsBMwRbE4QiSRi"], "tags": ["creatures", "3d", "anatomy", "love", "fear", "hate", "hatred", "hen600k", "chaoticbeauty"], "extra": {}}
