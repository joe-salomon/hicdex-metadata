The sun sets and paints the sky in fantastic pink colors!\nYou take another sip of ice drink and realize that you have all the weekend ahead of you, all summer and all life ...\nYou pull your drink and understand that everything will be fine for you ...\nThis is exactly the feeling this picture awakens in me. I see a magical sunset over the water, I see how the evening rays are reflected in a cocktail glass and ice cubes, how calm and long-awaited coolness descends on me ...\nAnd how do you feel?\nQuote by Victoria Savich\n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2017 200x100 cm   Spray paint on canvas 4616x2150 pix\n\nThe first collector of this NFT will receive this original painting. 1st collector, please DM me via Twitter @Maks_Denysenko", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWn7oBntqAwdMx4MNMCFWtpufwjciUEhnsxYURhgqQ4nC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUz2pBTCrieyjLBgYdeZzAw9XjVUSrujtXqYF91MUksic", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWn7oBntqAwdMx4MNMCFWtpufwjciUEhnsxYURhgqQ4nC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["original", "painting", "exclusive", "denysenko_art", "colorful", "spraypainting", "artist", "abstraction"], "extra": {}}
