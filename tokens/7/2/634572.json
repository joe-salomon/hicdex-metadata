There are many variations of this dance, from a pair of mating birds to the competition between the gods Brahma and  Wisnu. This dance is also said to be crated in Balinese palaces from the 19th century, to be danced by two young girls under the first full moon night in the palace courtyard, always with a fan and accompanied with gamelan music.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of over 17000 islands. There are many tribes, with their own individual dances and costumes, spread along these islands. I want to share with you the dances of my family heritage and of places I live.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXGtFz21ToKvAtkbfbLxNmHyRBBxtNfWmXwAKbatZ3qmn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcPiBZjx5gTRjTTACCVePREyDKShy4yQFBnLJ8tcpU5R5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmdiyC7XYfAEkWfs8CJ5EbJpfFJoMNM2PEFiP6BJypTNEM", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXGtFz21ToKvAtkbfbLxNmHyRBBxtNfWmXwAKbatZ3qmn", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2FQ9ciqi533mVrG8w1CvFP3xTKTE7jZGeV"], "tags": ["indonesia", "dancer", "illustration", "animation", "looping", "sea", "surfer", "beach", "bali", "waves", "coconuttree", "sunset"], "extra": {}}
