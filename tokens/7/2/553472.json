The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQc68Z7v6gxM1SXeNmUSNBBpPZ82KC6YhiqQeSK7BHgYy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWBVQa3bAaP8Z3n3aCyQGYQYbuts37TNF6PEpnUs25fTb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQc68Z7v6gxM1SXeNmUSNBBpPZ82KC6YhiqQeSK7BHgYy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fFQ6BVqcQk2gK1uCUmTMJ5cGdhQfraWdH"], "tags": ["fractal", "fractalart", "fractaldesign", "artwork", "algorithms", "generativeart", "exploration", "digitalart", "abstractart"], "extra": {}}
