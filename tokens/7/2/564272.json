This creature does not have light-digesting eggs like other creatures, it stores light which it digests directly on its skin, causing patches of bluish light in some parts of its skin. He consumes the light produced by other creatures or it can be said that he is a pure predator. He is a nocturnal creature or in other words he goes hunting at night. The Stygian Salazar Atrox is the fourth subspecies of the Metacreatura species to appear in the Metacreatura series.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeQe8xt564Ui9hkNNpabrRPR88Qn2sD4QsB9rsLcipFtu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXxqRqwXtTXSu2Z9DCbcwJm53eBuvBYvzHG7MF7SomTCU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeQe8xt564Ui9hkNNpabrRPR88Qn2sD4QsB9rsLcipFtu", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1churhR6VtAr5cWWiKrAxMgBEY4uMi9AJt"], "tags": ["metacreatura", "asia", "sci-fi", "creature", "faturwz", "3dillustration", "indonesia", "3d", "alienworld", ""], "extra": {}}
