The packs have become the same type, the design is boring, and the warnings about possible diseases are getting worse. Moreover, more and more space on the pack is given to the scrimmers. It seems to me alone that this is disrespect for smokers?) In my new series of works, I fantasized about how the packs of cigarettes would look if I worked out art for them. I hope you find something interesting for yourself :D", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRzWT65nqDXMQ5b32wYZpXNMMmz5Z9MEj1EtHjMDPrCmf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmURHmADiDB25u597qXRA3mMhuGe421BXiugxkgxyWpiMc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRzWT65nqDXMQ5b32wYZpXNMMmz5Z9MEj1EtHjMDPrCmf", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1c2FCVECYwmvvZrXR7RHjchHmZAyn1D5Kh"], "tags": ["Illustration", "digital", "art", "hand-drawn", "111"], "extra": {}}
