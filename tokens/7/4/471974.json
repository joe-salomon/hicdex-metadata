It is called the Cebu bearded pig, Baboy Talunon, Bakatin, and Baboy Ilahas, among others. Adult Visayan Warty Pigs can grow up to 100 centimeters (cm) in length. Estimates show that the largest adults of this species can weigh up to 80 kg. The body of this mammal is covered albeit sparsely with bristly hairs. The hairs are usually dark grey in color for the males and light brown or silvery for the females. The males, especially those found in Panay Island, grow tufts of hair from their heads down to their necks, which eventually become manes.\n\nIn Philippine Folklore, Pig attributed sometimes to Aswang.
