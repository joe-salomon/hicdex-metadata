In this project, I created a clock that over a period of ten minutes, displays a unique version of these stories. To be able to view this clock, the left-most side displays the current minute represented by the number of words, the middle column represents the ten\u2019s place digit of the seconds (thus it changes every 10 seconds) and the rightmost column represents the one\u2019s digit. \n\nThis gif represents the passage of time between 4:11 and 4:19, with a unique story in each frame.
