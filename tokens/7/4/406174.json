{"__version": 1, "token_id": 406174, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Impaler", "description": "Entered via: Pain rift #20211008\nPower level: Terror\nSize: 42 feet/ 12.8 meters tall\nAspect: Pain\nSecondary Aspects: Flesh\n\nImpalers are building-sized giants who have embraced self-mutilation to the point that they often tend to remove limbs, parts of their skulls, and pierce themselves with countless metal spikes. They see out of a grafted titanic eye on their chest, and they get their name from their fondness of impaling their victims on the spikes protruding from their own bodies. They also drag their titanic mass forward with two bony protrusions, often leaving trails of blood and gore in their wake.\n\nAs a Terror-level demon, these creatures are incredibly powerful. They can easily use vehicles they find as projectiles, and between the huge, girder-sized stakes riddling its body and it\u2019s incredible reach and strength, any direct confrontation is suicide. Airstrikes are generally recommended for combatting these monstrosities, as their incredible mass makes even automatic weapons fairly futile. Additionally, their obsession with pain only fuels their love of battle, and small arms will only further encourage its rampage.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRmxkrC2umTFYP9Ptbgc2HTJtNp9Y7g9FnEAU62ybuxK8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmamvxXYtANJbbF7c8HGKQge8Eao4iaHJSgxhoaAoH13yE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRmxkrC2umTFYP9Ptbgc2HTJtNp9Y7g9FnEAU62ybuxK8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["terror", "darkart", "mosnter", "demon", "darkwheel", "darkwheelnft", "horror", "horrorart", "evil", "demonic", "gore"], "extra": {}}
