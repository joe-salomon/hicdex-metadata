Grinding the beans with heads against the table. It wasn't a nightmare, I had fun. The blood is just a detail now that my house smells like paradise.\nBy the time they arrive I'll have everything clean but my face. I will receive them with a red face. It will be a memorable welcome, I want to be a good host to them.\nYou're invited too. I'll be waiting for you here, always awake.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYMn8gGZ32sKWUijdufBj6mSVnEN3hephW7bd8Hv9tcG2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbrzM4iafpaNJm9avPUnhaPvWzddoGLy8SdTniDrg5c8o", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYMn8gGZ32sKWUijdufBj6mSVnEN3hephW7bd8Hv9tcG2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LkZeTk6UoisEM1VvE7qWewjcE25hP9qNk"], "tags": ["nftart", "nftcollectors", "nftartist", "art", "nftcommunity", "coffee"], "extra": {}}
