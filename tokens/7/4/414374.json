Its name comes from the word tanggal meaning to remove or take off, because its form is that of a floating disembodied woman's head with its trailing internal organs still attached. From afar, it twinkles like a ball of flame, providing an explanation for the will-o'-the-wisp phenomenon.\n\nThe penanggalan exists by different names in every country of Southeast Asia. It is known as balan-balan in Sabah, leyak in Bali, kuyang in Kalimantan, palasik in West Sumatra, kra-sue in Thailand, kasu in Laos, ahp in Cambodia, and manananggal in the Philippines.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcmvH7Uxun8ExivRWtZQ5Cf5hCG57pBNP5NpuupRWuCDQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSQe6vTboF819ncH4nt8bUuQMVqNnvh2Apg1kpVdWikJw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcmvH7Uxun8ExivRWtZQ5Cf5hCG57pBNP5NpuupRWuCDQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QHYQ19QqY7pUUPWZMjBRpy8VmoH3Qq4zK"], "tags": ["Halloween", "October", "folklore"], "extra": {}}
