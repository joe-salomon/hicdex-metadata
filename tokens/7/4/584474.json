The animation reminds me of storm sequences often depicted in movies and television from the 60s and 70s.   \n\nIt was coded in GLSL.  \n\nFor now, please consider this image as a placeholder, not for sale.  Higher resolution versions will be uploaded in the coming days as I learn more about Hic et Nunc.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPAGB2ZJBV8JXKcxXbicPGhf284yP917edXuMYn4xh5u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRjz5u8BVqMwkkLKQMsfy3VufMR2NFdG7G11rjJAk2ba9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPAGB2ZJBV8JXKcxXbicPGhf284yP917edXuMYn4xh5u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1S18raUVAkvgneDTUMyHyMSQc3GLyYxc1e"], "tags": ["Storm", "moody", "GLSL"], "extra": {}}
