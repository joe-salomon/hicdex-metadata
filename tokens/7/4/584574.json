I started by picking a couple of local buildings that I could transform into epic creations. St. Mary Church in Mount Angel, the centerpiece of a medieval-style town, is my old stomping grounds.

Every day, the bells toll on the hour, reverberating throughout the small town as a reminder of the towering presence of this church.
