Before he died his mother cursed him to be wandering in the river and with his huge head in the shape of a gourd, which would wander day and night and would only be freed from the curse after devouring seven virgins, named Maria. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNhetxurmteFcWrKjbcRkNc9gSesCRGKnwRKeqH85mKvq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS34rtThuwuZW8MSftv1DRLsxgC44djHF4oseKCYSNVff", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNhetxurmteFcWrKjbcRkNc9gSesCRGKnwRKeqH85mKvq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["cryptolegends", "forest", "legends", "characters", "brazil"], "extra": {}}
