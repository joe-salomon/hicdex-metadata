The stakes couldn't have been any higher at any point in the last 10, 20, 30, 40, screw it, the last 100 years. This is one work of art that seemingly met the moment, but looking back didn't quite age well. I'll be candid, I thought shortly after this point that everyone would figure out Trump's been lying and the Right's chances would fall to zero. I couldn't have been more wrong. Not because he wasn't lying, but because his Cult45 kept drinking that delicious kool-aid of hate and inadvertently or directly believing in the tenets of white nationalism. When Trump infamously said that, \"...I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters...\", he was right. His cultist followers have shown time and time again they do not care about human life. (ironic, as most of them are pro-life...go figure. You can just smell the stench of hypocrites wafting about in the dense air of lies.) That's a lovely history lesson Andrew, but come on...is this art? You bet it is. It deals with everything I mentioned as well as the delusionment of the artist that thinks he can predict the future.
