{"__version": 1, "token_id": 544374, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "AGAINST", "description": "Another syntax crystal, but this time we have the justification all the way to the right. It all lines the G's up into a sideways pyramid that is literally pushed against the right hand side; a partial meta word and/or phrase. Each letter starting from G downwards/upwards is a real word and we just keep adding more and more into the mix until we get to AGAINST. What is fascinating with this one is how the positive and negative space play with each other. Sometimes the words are the focal point and sometimes the background becomes in focus. Strangeness in composition always makes the eyes roam and try to create meaning, even if meaning isn't there. We are story making machines.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZRYN5DNkgANnsXqUtKG3sPtPwkoChQYieJ2GH346Ev4P", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmatL9C65ppV1H7vTCnEgVStMd2ns3b1A2F1JHW7h1UKsq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZRYN5DNkgANnsXqUtKG3sPtPwkoChQYieJ2GH346Ev4P", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
