It had beautiful country paths to get lost in, geese running around, and a blacksmith\u2019s shop. At the general store, you could buy old fashioned candy sticks in hundreds of flavors. I would get lost just trying to choose one. My favorites were butterscotch and green apple. \n\nYou can get lost in this candy forest too. To see it in AR, view this page on your phone and press the little 3D icon in the corner of the image. Pinch/zoom to make your forest very large!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWZzfWPSPH6DXUD9pRW61kPyWQf5e1WrmfHAGL5BGb2Kx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRZ7dM636SxyCqhgk5nAzVSeHNXXqDWtZuvdCiyfPtK6C", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWZzfWPSPH6DXUD9pRW61kPyWQf5e1WrmfHAGL5BGb2Kx", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1iEBj6JB2iKDUCg2DPcyxbB3p9caVPr7Sd"], "tags": ["candy", "forest", "food", "3D", "fruit", "peppermint"], "extra": {}}
