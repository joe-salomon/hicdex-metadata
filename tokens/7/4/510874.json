Those simulations were necessary to produce individual, three-dimensional geometries. Furthermore, those individual objects and shapes are key elements of the immersive work \"Protopian Dreams\". Within this media work, these objects are subordinate to the overall work. As an independent NFT, the works are reduced to their basic form. No complex staging, textures or lighting. The raw form (clay rendering) as a medium that examines the issues of sub-urbanization, rural exodus or the basic right to housing and living.
