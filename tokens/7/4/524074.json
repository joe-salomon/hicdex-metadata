The reproduction is a beautiful object of the early twentieth century and is therefore in fact an antique find in itself. A find that represents an older find, which in turn represents the timeless icon of classic femininity. The head was scanned with a photogrammetry device, then processed in a 3D environment and remapped with new imaginative, lush, and colorful textures, all deriving from my original freehand or digital drawings.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYZaMvyJ59oDmgp29XkUsy1uDAarJ8vfQz2Mej6mbiE1s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfZUoEZWKhRUdiZ2hgYeTQHiJTCntXjrfSXRWW2m8nZ8z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYZaMvyJ59oDmgp29XkUsy1uDAarJ8vfQz2Mej6mbiE1s", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1amsgMaX2kYNLHMttB26Rf1EXmy5eJAwZG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dobject", "3dscan", "3dsculpture", "virtualsculpture", "3dmodel", "virtualreality"], "extra": {}}
