This molecule, an enzyme called PETase, is able to help us solve this problem.\nPETase was discovered in a bacteria (Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6) in a recycling plant in Japan. The bacteria had evolved to use PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) as a food source using an enzyme to break it down into usable chains. Scientists have since been able to extract this enzyme, obtain the structure by X-ray crystallography to high resolution and use this to design mutants which can break down PET at astounding rates.\nPET is an abundant plastic, most noticeably in plastic bottles. One plastic bottle takes around 450 years to decompose in landfill. Work on PETase has helped to decrease this timescale by orders of magnitude to just a few hours.\n\nMethod: X-RAY DIFFRACTION\nResolution: 1.70 \u00c5\n\nPAPER: http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718804115\nPDB ENTRY: http://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6EQD/pdb\n\nBakR d0mains PETase.fanart by Crystal Chris @crystalchris\nRarible: https://rarible.com/crystalchris\nTwitter: @CrystalChrisArt\nSupport your fellow labmates and grab one of these Limited Edition Fan Art NFTs!\nlimited 250 eds. only ever minted", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPWkwocc9o3xBx4xcEECumS3gWvHQFoirt51o8W9h9i6P", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRGMXdyh3SkeFrhbLbfbcvz4R4w7Wo6b279k99ZSpfLS9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPWkwocc9o3xBx4xcEECumS3gWvHQFoirt51o8W9h9i6P", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Ku5oXWWxHnkf81Y5s5Kf2o67cymF7iG3Z"], "tags": ["pdb", "xray", "science", "diffraction", "movie", "bakrd0mains", "stem", "spectroscopy", "pet", "petase"], "extra": {}}
