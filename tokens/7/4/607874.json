The series is made in Photoshop CC, bootleg version, with a low-quality mouse, click by click on a ultra low performance laptop. it was important to paint with the simplest brush possible, revealing the sweet digital imperfections, like paint plasters on an oil canvas. \n\n     In this series i make automatic drawings over silhouettes of pop culture, children cartoon characters. The result is an evil reflection of my childhood, a black mirror, some sort of shadow work experience. \n\nThis collection will grow over time, digging deep into the most notorious characters that shaped our infancy.
