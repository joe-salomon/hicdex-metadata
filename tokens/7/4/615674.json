The Moxxapha had contact with them long time ago, and these aliens are \u201cAdahn\u201d with their homeworld \u201c55 Cancri e\u201d. \u201c55 Cancri e\u201d was a super earth discovered back then in 2004, also known as \u201cJanssen\u201d\n\nWe immediately went there as directed by Jimra, and unfortunately this planet has already crushed to the ground. We went to search for any survivors as many as we can, we found couple of survivors and evacuated them to our vessel. When we asked what happened, they told us they were attacked by an unknown aliens without any warning and we conclude that was an attack from the alien invader.\n\nThe \u201cAdahn\u201d have white glowing pair of eyes, they stand at around 5 inches, greyish skin  with black accent around their body, they speak really loud somehow with a growl, and a really unique shaped head. Because of their glowing eyes, I nicknamed them \u201cLighthouse\u201d.\n\nAnother victim of the alien invader, we really need to act fast about this whole situation, this is inevitable. We need to prepare for the worst, the whole civilization rely on this alliance.\n\nBrig Gen. Abraham C.
