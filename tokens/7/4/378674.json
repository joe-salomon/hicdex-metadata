There is such peace in surrender. The sweet release of letting go when our grip has been so tight while holding on for dear life. Holding on and becoming rigid, so rigid that we cannot see cannot feel  & cannot hear, gripped in the fear of whatever will be when we stop holding on. Release the grip, release the tightness, the energy will shift and the flow will soothe your muscles and allow you to move with fluid grace once more.\n\nWhat do you need to let go of?\nWhat are you attached to?\nWhat are you holding onto?\n\nWhat will it be like if you let go?\n\nDo you feel your shoulders relaxing. Notice your breath, let your mind wander. Lie down do whatever it is you need to appreciate the moment. Let your body feel how good it is to let go and just be.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfCppfjxyzA1MnVBXC1mkcxGKQLYgknCFucn9VNucLHt9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWNxq5BMSSMyMbR4cxw2oeG4vLTqp5hQnniFWdKdeDdFH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfCppfjxyzA1MnVBXC1mkcxGKQLYgknCFucn9VNucLHt9", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
