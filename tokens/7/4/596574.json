At the time, I was focusing on grounding myself and connecting to the earth. That morning, as I walked the trail near my house, I stopped at multiple points to connect to the spirit of the trees, plants, rocks, and insects.\n\nI asked permission and collected the plants, leaves, and stones that spoke to me. I saw the earth and felt how she had been neglected and started to place the crystals with the intention of calling awareness to her needs to be seen, loved, heard, and nurtured. \n\nThe crystals I felt called to use were, lemon quartz, clear quartz, black kyanite, natural citrine, and bronzite. \n\n300dpi 1200x1600\n\n\nNFT owner has the right to resell the NFT and to publicly display the art.
