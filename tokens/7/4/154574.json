This was during the height of the Civil Rights and Anti-war movement and demonstrations, and the RESIST! graffiti on the bridge for \u201call to see\u201d was highly controversial at the time. This is the first NFT minting by a 75 year old technophile (called an \u201cegghead\u201d during the day) and the first of a series of never before seen historical photos from this era.
