He was working for an Electronic group that was playing a pretty big festival in North Georgia and he invited us to come. Neither my wife or I really listened to much EDM but dam if we didn't have a great time that weekend. The show was amazing, we saw some other groups that we really liked, and we got to act like we were in our 20's again even if it were only for a short while. The act my friend worked for wasn't called Pretty Lights for nothing.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNdKKDhpTdh9WzL4hbie77Ncz2k9BiLGapmrvvx44zm12", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPDuotvdG25oCxy7HdGfF1R97kxWjw7w7TCULTBMmTqvn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNdKKDhpTdh9WzL4hbie77Ncz2k9BiLGapmrvvx44zm12", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PquCtfV8wqb6VmX9yWAYRboVULwQ41Tg7"], "tags": ["collage", "montage", "photography", "Nikejerk"], "extra": {}}
