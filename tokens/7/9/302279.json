The old phrase \"alley cat\" may come to mind with some people: the rough-coated, scar-nosed, tattered-eared lurker of alleys and dumpsters. Others will think of their favorite cats.\n\nTabbies are so ubiquitous that many people think of them as a breed. Not so; the tabby is a color pattern, most often stripes, but sometimes stripes and whorls or even spots and stripes. The tabby pattern is so popular that it can be found in many pedigreed cats today and is accepted in many breeds by the most popular registries.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibqdry3snblqeo7ljbdymyj2vwrzjj4v3igegcyqdqtqwwlkeley4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibqdry3snblqeo7ljbdymyj2vwrzjj4v3igegcyqdqtqwwlkeley4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreibqdry3snblqeo7ljbdymyj2vwrzjj4v3igegcyqdqtqwwlkeley4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["animal", "pixelart", "pet", "objkt4objkt", "cat", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
