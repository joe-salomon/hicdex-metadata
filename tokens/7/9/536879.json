How precious are thy Thoughts to me, O God?  also hath aptly expressed those first rudiments of the Body, or that little Chaos out of which it rise. Hast thou not poured me out as Milk, and curdled me like Cheese? Thou hast clothed me with Skin and Flesh, and fenced me with Bones and Sinews.\n\nSeeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be, in holy conversation and godliness.\n\n1200x1200 px - Animated loop .gif - 18 seconds - 30 Fps - 20Mo\n\n\u00a9Vermine 2021\nhttps://twitter.com/V3RM1N3_\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZx3duwrLH9uuCuHUpr7iRezxcxUKQpXWvswEjNf6bnVk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZx3duwrLH9uuCuHUpr7iRezxcxUKQpXWvswEjNf6bnVk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZx3duwrLH9uuCuHUpr7iRezxcxUKQpXWvswEjNf6bnVk", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WgYpFP6A18hHJFsjd8PuW9XrAqeQC1jrx"], "tags": ["animated", "gif", "animated-gif", "pixel", "pixel-art", "art", "generative", "generative-art", "glitch", "cypherpunk", "punk", "code", "electro", "techno", "video", "cosmic", "vermine"], "extra": {}}
