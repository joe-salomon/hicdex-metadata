Each artwork is meant to be a snap-shot in time. Not the beginning nor the end, but a brief transient moment.\n\nThis series was inspired by my previous career in anthropology and the vivid scenes of human remains being consumed by the Earth in which they lay. Symbiotic and intertwined, human nourishing botanical and fungal, in turn sprouting life.\n\nBy @dehiscenceart 2021\nJPG 5400px X 7200px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUcPobLXwaR5r69Sy8wp8cssnMCdt5JjGATR7syzoUSx1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdQv1a3NdiudVv7HLrU22C2dWDK73LsBLWfxXuopemg6X", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUcPobLXwaR5r69Sy8wp8cssnMCdt5JjGATR7syzoUSx1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bvSRkvhpmHWsbKi5YSoK4ktoJrpNSYfB1"], "tags": ["HENHALLOWEEN", "botanical", "gan", "darkart", "decay", "expressionism", "spiritual", "death", "life", "cleannfts", "aiart", "anthropology", "rebirth"], "extra": {}}
