The bald eagle appears on its seal. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extinction in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered, and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the contiguous states on June 28, 2007.\n\nBald eagles are found along the lakes and rivers of Yellowstone National Park where they perch in nearby trees watching for fish below. The best areas to watch for these majestic birds include Yellowstone River and Lake. Although some adult bald eagles will winter in the park most migrate to lower elevations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVd6jKQ2ZagMBqL5xX3q7p7x92hzJ1H79tJeJF47qu8kB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYey3EybxLJY7n1namf2pnV6JFgZTd1oeBgjnma8KhY74", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVd6jKQ2ZagMBqL5xX3q7p7x92hzJ1H79tJeJF47qu8kB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UbjEFbdzQtN3Vxc8TBdEWN3deBGa5JChU"], "tags": ["BaldEagle", "Emblemofanation", "National", "USA", "America", "Eagle", "Wildife", "Photography", "BNW", "B&W", "BlackandWhite", "Monochrome", "Tezos"], "extra": {}}
