This painting came to life as an automatic drawing exercise. I noticed the figure of a black dog ready to attack something and it clicked to me as the day that Nadja attacked an old lady in the street. \n\n\"in Nadja's world\" 2021\nmixed media\n4026\u200a\u00d7\u200a2810", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZoRu2VicTKW41xyaBWppMQFgrDrbw63JHbvB6KKfS7tT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeqQfHtxYA4SXKtfJwVb86cWoMQvTtog1bhkT5BgiysAh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZoRu2VicTKW41xyaBWppMQFgrDrbw63JHbvB6KKfS7tT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WP9ADWkGoP9pWL3tin1fmLT2xJmvkJMky"], "tags": ["Nadja", "breton", "dog", "automatism", "surrealism", "abstraction", "xobaia"], "extra": {}}
