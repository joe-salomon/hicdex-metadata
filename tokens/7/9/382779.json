I was drawn to it, Maybe it's those lights, slowly drifting away along the slow movement of the abyss. As I got closer, I realized it was an enormous coral formation, the bulb were standing on top of impressive arms. It's probably a type of Anemonae. For documentation purposes I will name it Abyssus Lampadis ( the lamp of the abyss ). the lamps seems to emit a sound, some type of music... I need to go closer to make sure...\n\nAbyssys Lampadis is the third and final piece of the Corals series.\n\n20x20 inches\n7500 x 7500px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaYiu15VUo3ABxXU1q3K1r88jgfKTFsX2b4fJHkKhSdo1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPEmFD4wgoifPb6NwNdUCmUjdbMkpQg8zqDvK1BAkkH8R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaYiu15VUo3ABxXU1q3K1r88jgfKTFsX2b4fJHkKhSdo1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aTHPgADTSw2a7kZe9b1ASpYvNmkc1vNDB"], "tags": ["processing", "art", "p5", "genartclub", "generativeart", "generative", "javascript"], "extra": {}}
