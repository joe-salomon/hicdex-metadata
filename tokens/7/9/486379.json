{"__version": 1, "token_id": 486379, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "RUNAWAY", "description": "Around this time I also began to think about an offshoot of syntax crystals and how separate words can come together to create new words. In this case, I thought about how the word itself can define itself in a meta way. The word RUNAWAY can be separated into two words RUN & AWAY. We can create a literal narrative by progressively separating the words line after line; giving the illusion of movement. As the words diverge from each other, they exude a certain truth about the word RUNAWAY, which is RUNAWAY can RUN AWAY from itself. The structure also resembles a pair of legs in motion, as if to insinuate the act of walking or running. I call these kinds of phenomenon, Word Zippers. This one happens to diverge from one another, most of the ones you'll see in the future will be the opposite; separate words converging/crashing/merging into a brand new word.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPCZ5icNaGmERw2iW631tSwaWqmVCHUvsBp1hhPLGw8RA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdF8mxw6rLsrEce1fp5MfirkxG1h34mdfLzS5BkPDsrpM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPCZ5icNaGmERw2iW631tSwaWqmVCHUvsBp1hhPLGw8RA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
