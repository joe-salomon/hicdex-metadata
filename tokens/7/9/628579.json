I\u2019m one of the fishermen you sent us out to find the Shalapoon. The Doctor quickly opened the door and went out onto the porch. Ssh! You\u2019ll wake the Queen.\n\n\u201cWhat news do you have?\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news at all sir. The Shalapoon has sank and we can\u2019t find any survivors. All we could find was wreckage floating in the water. \u201cHow do you know it was the Shalapoon?\u201d the doctor said back quietly.\n\n\u201cWe found this piece of wood it says Shalap\u2026 the rest was missing . \u201cOh I see. Well thank you for that. Lets just keep this to ourselves just now\u201d \u2013 \u201cThe Queen doesn\u2019t need to hear this news. Here\u2019s a silver coin. That should help keep you quiet for now\u201d said the doctor as he passed it over.\n\nJan 12th #gistlidia\nhttps://gistlidia.xyz/deception/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWqupmNhNG25AXs1CUXqEA8ueKq4ogPbAqddyMuhnpDNw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcPWf7ZNGvCSGNFMXhmRNEGsVydEkmhkDLyKzexp28xUQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWqupmNhNG25AXs1CUXqEA8ueKq4ogPbAqddyMuhnpDNw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhqH6bkJkfgdgJbWSnKhUuhPx8aaBV7TQ"], "tags": ["shalapoon", "gistlidia", "ship", "story"], "extra": {}}
