If you were in a place that was a completely perfect pristine and unending place where only good things happen, wouldn't that eventually be like hell? Nothing would change. No ups and downs. Nothing to; only unending bliss. And vice versa applies because in hell there would be some people who would get used to the pain and suffering of eternal damnation. Obviously, this is an extreme look at what is considered \"normal\" by most monotheistic religions around the world. What happens when we scramble and jumble HEAVEN & HELL as an anagram? We wind up with the phrase, HEH, ALL EVEN. Ironically within two extremes of eternity is that common middle ground of being even. Is this art, fate, or pretentious ramblings of a madman?
