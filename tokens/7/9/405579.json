Ridley Scott's first Alien movie keeps me up at night, off of set design alone. As I venture deeper and deeper in the the future of art with NFTs and Web3, I can't help but harken back to the technology and aesthetics that have always inspired me. Combining footage captured from my circuit bent analog video equipment and audio created from my analog synthesizer, I crafted this piece that feels wholly and entirely \"me\". Edition of 24, priced at 4.2 tez because 42 & 24 are my angel numbers. I hope that you vibe with the vision and take part on this creative journey with me, as this is merely a jumping off point.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ64DzgdTFVTfm7GB65ppr827FL3YStEJBgWE5HHGykUh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWtH5hsLPsf2E7D3RL4TKB8vBSuXX8nXaRNSLeAgSkeQh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ64DzgdTFVTfm7GB65ppr827FL3YStEJBgWE5HHGykUh", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MVJ3aaMDn8HukkkeHekkhQDUGUVJyBtMD"], "tags": ["audio", "visual", "analog", "digital", "vhs", "aesthetic", "retro", "future", "trippy", "psychedelic", "videoart", "circuitbent", "generative"], "extra": {}}
