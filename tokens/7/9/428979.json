She is glamorous, beautiful, clad in headgear of various hues of green. You pause and look closer. Is she... Does her neck resemble the trunk of a majestic tree? If so, is her headgear less fashion and more like the top of a tree? A glamorous, gorgeous, alluring tree. It depends on what you see in this artwork. Imagination brings her into our brains and makes bus want to know her story. What is her story?\nHer blue mask fiercely protects her, her eyes convey her openness to experiencing life, her jewels proclaim her to be a woman of means. She is, simply, the woman in the blue headgear.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYnAZtobRhyL1ZT8Cxmx31FHBuqo2GgCTySDEn9ZVfzPG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYnAZtobRhyL1ZT8Cxmx31FHBuqo2GgCTySDEn9ZVfzPG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYnAZtobRhyL1ZT8Cxmx31FHBuqo2GgCTySDEn9ZVfzPG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1X1ToMENirSHmj89avqhfxhRZpqiiXNohX"], "tags": ["woman", "mystery", "fashion", "headgear", "hat", "1920s", "1930s", "flapper", "tree", "branches", "trunk", "Hollywood", "supperclub", "green", "jewels"], "extra": {}}
