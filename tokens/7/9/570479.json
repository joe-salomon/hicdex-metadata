Maybe, for some of you it was just a normal thing. But it means a lot to me. Sometime ago I was doubting myself, doubting my art, but this community gave me a huge support. I can't thank enough for all your support. I got my confidence back. To believe in my art. It feels really good, knowing someone out there appreciate my work. Thank you so much NFT Community.\n\nMaybe I don't deserve to celebrate anything right now. But I just wanted to say thank you, in the way I know. Sharing the joy I felt. This is my favorite piece of art I\u2019ve ever made.\n\n1000px x 1000px\nLooping forever", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb95ADgu5rpTLReeuFfmdhSg1L4WYUCgev5hD8SUnvwHK", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb95ADgu5rpTLReeuFfmdhSg1L4WYUCgev5hD8SUnvwHK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb95ADgu5rpTLReeuFfmdhSg1L4WYUCgev5hD8SUnvwHK", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1angFtqvvLdZnoPhqPcUeNL7oFGYs5T2gv"], "tags": ["gif", "illustration", "digitaldrawing", "looping", "joy", "gratitude", "happyplace"], "extra": {}}
