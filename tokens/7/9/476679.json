{"__version": 1, "token_id": 476679, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "FADED AF", "description": "One of my personal favorite palindromes of all time isn't really a palindrome in the traditional sense. FADED AF spells faded af backwards and forwards. The AF stands for \"as fuck\". Because of the advent of texting, social media, and memes in mainstream culture, shorthand writing using initials of words has become almost endemic to most people under the age of say 40. Sorry Boomers, you're probably not going to get or understand this. When people use the terminology of FADED AF, it's usually in the context of being absolutely high or under the influence of cannabis to the point of mental intoxication and the state of being completely \"out-of-it\". With the work here, we can see as the word progresses downwards it becomes more and more visually faded from left to right. This is to illustrate the effects of cannabis on the individual as time progresses and the higher they get. It's a great palindrome to personally express the feeling of being under the influence of cannabis edibles. In fact, this work was made under that very influence, kinda meta.
