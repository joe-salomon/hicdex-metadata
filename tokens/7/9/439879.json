Filomenus was only six years old.\n\nWhen he was 18, Filomenus went to his first Night of the Frogs event, accompanied by his great friend the magician and conjurer Calixto. It is said that since that night the King was not the same. Not only did he return with mystical and philosophical delirium but also with a terrible smallpox. They also say that it was Calixto himself who managed to transcribe in his \"Inefficient Book of All Non-Absolute Truths\" all that the Peppos dictated to Filomenus while he was in transe.\n\nAfter that night and based on the writings of Calixto, King Filomenus ruled that Peppology would be the new religion of Morondanga.\n\nFilomenus was the first king in history to die from a fright caused by his own reflection on a crescent moon night at the age of 35.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmajiErS9Y5ZEibgCrMQdCBdb5xUQGsdiHfohcBXFWfX1o", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbNFJpT5jpcWGvu5rJbLJ4otUoxE612QiyqJLWwFYPJbE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmajiErS9Y5ZEibgCrMQdCBdb5xUQGsdiHfohcBXFWfX1o", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "king", "Stamp", "Illustration"], "extra": {}}
