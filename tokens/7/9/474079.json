For his freedom, the devil spared Jack 10 years of his own.\n\t\nStingy Jack tricked the devil twice.\"Pick me an apple and I\u2019ll gladly follow you after.\" The devil climbed a tree and Jack carved a cross on the bark. For his freedom, the devil granted Jack an everlasting one.\n\nStingy Jack died and denied by hell and heaven. The devil gifted him an ember for his lantern, and now Jack roamed the earth forever.\n\ntjhinoz, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaV6rpTZ2NwJ2rqrum5Kv9L9JYfn9JhJ3vDGXRGJFRiDx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaV6rpTZ2NwJ2rqrum5Kv9L9JYfn9JhJ3vDGXRGJFRiDx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaV6rpTZ2NwJ2rqrum5Kv9L9JYfn9JhJ3vDGXRGJFRiDx", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cixKdkeRAhzLafcL7FFW8i3eveiwmjhDE"], "tags": ["stereoscopic", "gif", "pumpkin", "jackolantern", "immortalface", "henhalloween", "#henhalloween", "moon", "bats"], "extra": {}}
