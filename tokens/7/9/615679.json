She takes the viewer into an idealized vision of a world where interference colours cover the sky, creating a subjugating sense of calm. In this piece, seconds become years. Gradually this mesmerizing world is being transformed into a darker, but equally fascinating vision. 14 seconds to experience the metamorphosis of utopia into dystopia. 14 years to reach carbon neutrality or the point of no return.\n\nDiane Drubay is a visual artist working with photography and digital media to create visions of alternative realities. She nudges for more Nature awareness and positive change for better futures.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfXLpauEMESpFo1QvrKPMBv1Lf9Uova67wFTcJpSe9Zui", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYCtWJL2w7XxTRYW5GpS99hGCbWEmxoxwkhxt6ZmFgbGv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVo3J9eJfkAvmwuksGBW26LCh1Hiyn6zZkvZHcciNbG4N", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfXLpauEMESpFo1QvrKPMBv1Lf9Uova67wFTcJpSe9Zui", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WDKWWCC22CmumaU2yAY4z714FvhgED4Q4"], "tags": ["alterhen", "cards"], "extra": {}}
