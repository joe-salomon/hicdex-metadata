I remember houses built and schools running with fishes and rays swirling around. There was no need to go to the surface because you could also see the blue sky and the storms that sometimes screamed for solitude. It was not a split thing where people were on the surface and people under. It was just like that, we were submerged and enchanted. At night you could walk around neon midnite bars and enjoy a city filled with gatcha games and vending machines while Air sounded in the background. I didn\u2019t want to tell you sooner. I think this will destroy you.\" \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPWYysAfc8Pfoyp1D6YvrMbUqBSCVHvfFKCu5NdqdpDY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXKMoCuUqJbrzcG9xgoGxRnSavU4uJxjK5X6WkKpCzVLm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPWYysAfc8Pfoyp1D6YvrMbUqBSCVHvfFKCu5NdqdpDY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MyVLKn4jt4CAx6QP8fdVG2UgDCXeCm3SD"], "tags": ["DigitalArt\uff0cDigitalDrawing\uff0cFungi\uff0cIllustration\uff0cMushroom\uff0cNature\uff0cOcean\uff0cPsychedelic\uff0cSurreal\uff0cUnderwater\uff0cWater"], "extra": {}}
