Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. Academicians have identified four reliable theories on the origin of the Chinese dragon: snakes, Chinese alligators, thunder and nature worship.They traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, typhoons, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck for people who are worthy of it in East Asian culture.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSDbti6aWuhHcvTQwq4FuFeyUues6rVmcoq2QxJ8wxt1S", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSDbti6aWuhHcvTQwq4FuFeyUues6rVmcoq2QxJ8wxt1S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSDbti6aWuhHcvTQwq4FuFeyUues6rVmcoq2QxJ8wxt1S", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2PvQhnwgrnYrZN1JxWHa9mzMhX1CoT65rA"], "tags": ["Chinesedragon"], "extra": {}}
