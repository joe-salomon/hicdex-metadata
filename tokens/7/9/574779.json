I... \nI have to whisper and try to tell other soldiers in the future. \nBut I believe, \nNo one will ever listen, before they face the death themselves...\n\nWell mother, this is not even a letter, not a message, because I have no time to send or write or type. \nJust a whisper to wind, to come and find you guys in a warm spring night, calming you with my love.\nGoodbye ma, hug my dad, say hello to everyone, I am...\nNo more...\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbd3i3RqE4cyVtWrgeVy7A1buR2QJ5bWR5pQpycid4K6w", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmaymt9v7hU42sjCe8rPNHWdksfzHVDUsEqXZzKLWN9fCd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbd3i3RqE4cyVtWrgeVy7A1buR2QJ5bWR5pQpycid4K6w", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1U7ve7hvzHdnFhFEyHE3WZT2Pcgt5y7KJB"], "tags": ["war", "ptsd", "shellshock", "death", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
