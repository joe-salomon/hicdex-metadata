Frogs at night, with their choral chirping. In the days you could spot wallabies, when our dogs weren't tearing through making a ruckus and scaring them back to their little Wallaby abodes. Everything now seemed eerily quiet, only crackling and the occasional crash of falling trees. Smoke lingered and ash drifted hauntingly on the breeze. This was no longer a valley of brimming life and green. Just black and grey, silence.\"\n\nPhotography by Jay Moon, during the Australian wildfires; November 2019.\n#12 of 15.\nAll funds generated go toward the ongoing recovery.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSGsmJZwnXtPjStJnNGBRqrqhNWypbEWU6iMjnronQyfC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdFVak2j5G7xi19PrVEaq957HvgxHBAu4hU6iFAAh9Dkr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSGsmJZwnXtPjStJnNGBRqrqhNWypbEWU6iMjnronQyfC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2G2NzfXg5JDLcCQxGmToT8goBBGPwo1dtj"], "tags": ["photography", "fire", "australia", "wildfires", "natural"], "extra": {}}
