I sat there that evening to recharge after my day and take in the beauty of my surroundings for some respite.\nThe conflict in Darfur is still ongoing at the time of minting.\n\nTaking a moment to find tranquility to feel grounded and at peace is important no matter where we are or life's circumstances; for some this is a challenge to do.
