I ran into him first while out shooting with some friends.\nAfter ruining the entire first roll I shot of him and his friends, I said we'd have to try again. He invited me out another time after that, and I've been going at least once a week since. That was almost 3 months ago. I talk to and take photos of all of them all the time now. \nThe series started with him, and he really embraces me and my work. It works. He tries whatever I throw his way so we can get the best shots.\n\nA photo from \"Wheelies on Travis St.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicaxupy5hxe2oz2zrnzib7m3bzh6lfijpfwhjd26h7hvuoy67poje", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreia565hnf27ng5fr6xib43dueiqy5b6lvv3f6lvnaeyj4bsrshv2ti", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicaxupy5hxe2oz2zrnzib7m3bzh6lfijpfwhjd26h7hvuoy67poje", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
