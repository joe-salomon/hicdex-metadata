{"__version": 1, "token_id": 509179, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "grid.token.art.01", "description": "Owners who collected and burned a grid.token get the chance receive a unique artwork created by Mark Knol. The artwork will be creatively and procedurally painted using provided avatar/photo/art of choice and send to their Tezos wallet as NFT. The collected grid will be the base for the new artwork.  \n---\n\nThis OBJKT is the second result of the first collected + burned \"grid.token.01\" (OBJKT #347713).\n\nPersonal note:  \nChris requested this artwork to be a tribute to an artwork called \"Oprah\" by Michele Petrelli (OBJKT #164776). The abstract portrait has a really good composition and great contrasting lighting. The result has a sense of a portrait, yet it stays very mysterious. Thanks Chris!\n\nMore info about grid.tokens https://grid-tokens.stroep.nl/\n\ngrid.token.01 was claimed by \nChris Cassano (tz1NM2GD7d8L9oYurYSy3R1Cy7ZAU1ExDyC6) @chriscassano\n\nMore about Michele Petrelli (https://hicetnunc.xyz/MPetrelli) can be found on michelepetrelliart.com and instagram @michelepetrelliart", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNt8hLHsputytLAccg3rnepeECbw1GKPfVrAi8d8cMwKv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPioUZwugYKkhKcKmGo1YKTgxfeMqL4vaKL8aiiL3H72R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNt8hLHsputytLAccg3rnepeECbw1GKPfVrAi8d8cMwKv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XrutuvkFRG15HmV2gdon86F38NMMGMAXr"], "tags": ["gridtoken", "generativeart", "markknol"], "extra": {}}
