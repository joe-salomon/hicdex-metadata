The only time I've been to Colorado I was invited to participate in a group show at the Kidrobot Boulder store and my wife and I flew out there for the event. While I was there I happened to catch a pic of this beautiful vintage sign. It's funny that I took  hundreds of photos of the mountains and nature while I was there and am still most drawn to this piece of advertising history.
