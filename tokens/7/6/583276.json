We were informed early on in my pregnancy so we were able to be prepared mentally. Nothing could emotionally prepare us for what was to come. She had 3 surgeries before she was 2 years old (which left permanent scarring which is what this piece is based off) and weekly hospital visits. She has to wear boots and a brace to sleep till she is 5 and is in pain every night. She is the most amazing and strong person I know, which is why her middle name is Maeve after the Irish warrior Queen. \n\nToday is her 3rd birthday so I wanted to finish off this piece and mint it in celebration of how far she has come.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU9zpAz8ZCCaTvrB56CJESMyN728CNieEji6WAbyDWB3v", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU9zpAz8ZCCaTvrB56CJESMyN728CNieEji6WAbyDWB3v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU9zpAz8ZCCaTvrB56CJESMyN728CNieEji6WAbyDWB3v", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2WNACb1WD61a4jXwMzu5dSAe7nXCaphEK3"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
