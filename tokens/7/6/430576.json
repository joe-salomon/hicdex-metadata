Heightmaps are generated by GANs trained with custom datasets and then prepared and rendered into Unreal Engine as 3D terraformation. While the concepts of map and border appear as mere theoretical and functional superstructure,  the landscapes and territories with their nuances, inlets, breaks, colors and topological diversity  depict the meeting of human data in the border points,  marking the landmarks of meeting and fusion of thoughts, feelings and experiences.
