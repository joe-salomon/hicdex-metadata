Please Stand By, Kanye Was a GOP Plant. A new investigation by The Daily Beast, uncovered that Kanye West\u2019s failed political campaign for president in the 2020 election was funded by a covert group of GOP elite\u2019s in a bid to take minority votes away from Biden and help pave a way to a Trump victory. \u201cAt the heart of Kanye\u2019s political operation was Holtzman Vogel, one of the most powerful well-connected law firms serving major Republican political and nonprofit organizations today\u2026 Federal disclosures also show the campaign enlisted legal services from an array of firms with links to Trump and the Republican party - including leading voter fraud conspiracy theorists.\u201d It is at this time unclear whether Kanye and his team were aware of the links to said funders due to the discrete nature of which many of these donations were listed and reported but the one thing that is clear is that he was being used as a tool to try to get Trump elected. Either way a sad and disgusting tactic in which minorities were exploited in service or aiding white elites at keeping control of their power and money.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYFGzyJtqybJDd7HpcGomYBDZvqowEJvSVaahz2X2cXNm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRKy6KJE8u99TvhtjmqKMkFV4oByC6qu1beFYNBRRqfzJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYFGzyJtqybJDd7HpcGomYBDZvqowEJvSVaahz2X2cXNm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
