I submerge myself in a bath hoping to see the spark of a bathroom light filter through drops spilled across skin,\n\nbut only see bubbles,\n\nair confined in a makeshift space.\n\n \n\nWhy then do I reach for bubbles when all I get is soap seeped into skin? What is hope in a time of despair when it\u2019s as      weightless      as a breath, never making impact? Why submerge myself under the ocean, look up to see the water-morphed sun, and think it\u2019s more beautiful\n\n \n\nthen,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthan when I was surfaced?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has 2 effects:\n\n1. The image it is!\n2. If you have some 3D glasses lying around, try one on and look at the image! Just make sure that you are using the retro 3D glasses. The red and blue kind.\n\nThe image in 3D creates depth and a portal into the image to make it look like a window into a new dimension! So if you want get the 3D glasses and try it out!\n\nWidth: 900px\nHeight: 900px\n\nOriginal Image: 3968 x 2976\nExposure Time: 1/6410s\nFocal Length: 26mm\nISO Speed: 100\nF-Stop: f/2.2\nCamera: DJI Mavic Pro\nLocation: Switzerland", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYV1o99nGQa9C9zCbcPEACWwX7n7c61dhdhyicHyNjrVP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYV1o99nGQa9C9zCbcPEACWwX7n7c61dhdhyicHyNjrVP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYV1o99nGQa9C9zCbcPEACWwX7n7c61dhdhyicHyNjrVP", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SFQD7VLwDVkiWBmyeR8PoyFaifRtaeKTa"], "tags": ["landscape", "mountain", "neon", "pixel", "pixelsorting", "photograph", "rainbow", "loop", "aftereffects", "gif", "animation", "sky", "aurora", "stereoscopic", "3d", "anaglyph", "telescope", "observatory"], "extra": {}}
