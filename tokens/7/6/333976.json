The fading sunlight hides behind the curtain.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she frowns, \u201cI have an appointment.\u201d\n\u201cDisappointment,\u201d an almost indiscernible breath.\n\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cI said that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\nThe assistant smiles and runs her nail along her thumb. \u201cI do apologize for the inconvenience. It\u2019s an urgent appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mistake me.\u201d The boss stares. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for you. You will stay late.\u201d\nCrazy bitch, she thinks and thinks to quit.\nThe little git should die, and a familiar flash of anger momentarily seizes her.\nShe shakes the thought and simmers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a doctor\u2019s appointment for my daughter,\u201d she murmurs.\n\u201cThen the father can take her.\u201d\nShe glances at the placard on his desk and sighs.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll pin her death on you then.\u201d And she realizes she\u2019d said it aloud.\n\nHe looks at her, a glimmer of surprise surfaces his eyes.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\nAnd she realizes she could handle his contempt no more.\n\u201cI quit.\u201d\nShe leaves the office and stretches her sore back.\n\nAll photography\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f was produced and edited by \ud83d\udd25Dennis Sarovski\ud83d\udd25, Poem is by my Wife :) \nCheck me out on: https://www.instagram.com/dennis_sarovski/\nCheck her out on: https://www.instagram.com/thewrittennomad/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSpdQebvQmDk2YPpRmskcWQzPcLBv4t61PB7goqPgPt1s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYaQwukWr64iJL3dcyiN1ofRd5YVFevkGe84vZUJJTahe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSpdQebvQmDk2YPpRmskcWQzPcLBv4t61PB7goqPgPt1s", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SFQD7VLwDVkiWBmyeR8PoyFaifRtaeKTa"], "tags": ["trending", "animated", "girl", "neon", "photo", "cool", "abstract", "popular", "effect", "sexy", "acid", "tezos", "nftart", "art", "cyberpunk", "pic", "techno", "digital", "irl", "artwork", "photograph", "chrome", "rainbow", "blockchain", "urban", "loop", "hen", "hicetnunc", "aftereffects", "creative", "nft", "rare", "crypto", "digitalart", "cyber", "mp4", "animation", "symmetrical", "motion", "colorful", "objkt", "cryptoart", "trippy", "render", "heatmap", "lingerie", "lsd", "goddess", "ethereal", "rain"], "extra": {}}
