{"__version": 1, "token_id": 558376, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Break of Dawn", "description": "\nStaring at the ocean has the ability to change our brain waves\u2019 frequency and puts us in a mild meditative state. The constant ebb and flow and soothing sound of the waves has a de-stimulating effect and provides a euphoric escape from our busy lives. Moments like these are ones to cherish forever. Feeling the warmth of that first sun ray, watching the lagoon illuminate with color, and being one with the flow of the sea. Sunrise is a universal language. Whether you just got through a tough day or lived the best day of your life, the break of dawn is a clean slate for us all. A breath of fresh air, a rush of energy, and the heart beat of life. That's what I hope to share with this photo. In the end, we\u2019re all just dreamers looking for our slice of paradise. This is the first piece in Eric Rubens\u2019 \"Colors of French Polynesia\" collection - the first location to be featured on SuperRare. The initial collector will receive a signed physical print of the image as well as unlock GPS coordinates to find this precise location in our beautiful world. Size will be determined by the collector after purchase.
