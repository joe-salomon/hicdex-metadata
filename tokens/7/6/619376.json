Unfortunately, Unicode, the organization responsible for the standardization of digital symbols, declined both proposals in its first selection rounds.\n\nUnicode adds a selection of emoji each year, based on incoming proposals. Anyone can submit an idea for an emoji. The total selection procedure can take up to a year from submission to implementation. Many devices and apps use their own design sets for emoji, so the proposal is more a conceptual defense than a design challenge.\n\nThe Stone Tool and Hand Stencil proposals were deemed to be used not frequently enough for implementation, although I argued their conceptual merits would outweigh those, since especially the prehistoric cave art of hand stencils are the first examples of pictograms. \n \nThis .pdf - originally a Google Docs file - contains the submission for an emoji proposal at the Unicode consortium (p. 2-12), and an addendum concerning the result (p. 12-13). This document is minted on the Tezos blockchain as an archival NFT in January 2022. \n\n------------\n \nConsiderable segments of my artistic body of work arise from attempts to connect my digital practice to the origins of art - or image - making within human evolution. Parallel to this, I\u2019m interested in using consumer technology as a tool, and digital \u2018pop\u2019 culture as a mature, additional language of art history.\n\n\ud83d\udd17\n\nalexandracrouwers.com | i. alexa_crwrs | t. @acrwrs\n ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVm6b4TytPq5yd2huAzu3BHXfBFC4zS7VY2AYt1WCD9px", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP28LAaAKHHWHPDAhtuzxKmUdjfBxDt7kUuUVECDyGJxu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVm6b4TytPq5yd2huAzu3BHXfBFC4zS7VY2AYt1WCD9px", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1hHkndmCoSd7LNNK9QZwDJbaWnBmjpQeQX"], "tags": ["unicodehandstencilalexandracrouwers", "acrwrs", "archive", "pdf", "conceptual", "prehistory", "hand", "document", "emoji", "proposal"], "extra": {}}
