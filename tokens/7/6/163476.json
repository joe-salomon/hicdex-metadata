I wanted to share this Repin drawing because it's quite relevant for me at the moment. There is a big Repin exhibition at the Ateneum art museum in Helsinki going on that I haven't yet visited (because of covid) and I hope to see there the originals of these studies of Repin I've done and of course all the amazing paintings.\n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39\u200e\u200e\nI'm not sure why, but I've always found drawing and painting in the style of Repin quite easy. It comes quite naturally for me. I love his sketching style, especially on portraits where the face can have a lot of rendering and focus but secondary features are drawn with very loose lines. Obviously this was to save time on drawing from life for him. If I would draw portrait on a \"classical\" style these days, I would most likely want to do it in similar style as Repin.\n\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39\ud83d\udd39\u200e\u200e\nI have few artbooks of Repin artworks which are great for practicing drawing. They are bit larger than A5 and with great quality photos. I hope to draw from the actual artworks over at Ateneum.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPSY1sMk5xDbK4q5H6Xud3c9tKWNEhNKVkpKyLtwSZkS1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTSomLeGSjyeEmvte83gxrho7qx6cNUfC5kzLAMqWd5Xu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPSY1sMk5xDbK4q5H6Xud3c9tKWNEhNKVkpKyLtwSZkS1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2HKNUtWphTJVEsqM8A4hPir4y9mk6S2CXE"], "tags": ["waltreunamo", "sketchbook", "repin", "masterstudy"], "extra": {}}
