Yates (Holy Fool)", "description": "[Photograph of trash can from Three Rivers Mall in Kelso, WA, USA with digital drawing, embellishments, moshing, and color. Animated with a free application on my phone.] I'm a huge fan of the \"TRASH ART\" ethos, although I've made very little \"OFFICIAL\" Trash Art. (Can something so renegade be \"official?\") My take on the whole thing is that it's akin to Pop Art, taking the least revered elements of society (in this case the process of waste disposal) and elevating them to \"ART\" (which is sacred...for artists...) My piece also has a monster in it! (Pop culture note: Oscar the Grouch was originally orange before he had some kind of fur disorder that changed him green!) ---Richard F.
