We saw a crashed a massive space vessel when we scouting the planet and that's where the SOS signal come from.\n\nAfter we proceed to land near the crashed vessel, we slowly approached the site and we founded like hundreds of these aliens, some of them heavily wounded due to the crash. We dispatched an evac fleet to help them up, it took 2 vessel to contain them all. The captain of the vessel spoke to the Methuselah and it seem they can understand each other. \n\nJimra told me that these aliens are \"Chressa\" but we prefer to call them \"Blues\" and they were escaping from a massive invasion on their home planet \"Kepler-22b\" by an unknown hostile alien race. The invasion came without a warning as they told us, they came in guns blazing and pretty much wiped their population quickly. \n\nThis whole situation kinda changes everything...we gotta prepare for those aliens bastard, with a shared technology between the humanity and Moxxapha I'm pretty sure we could hold them off. We just gotta wait till' they come for us...don't mess with us humans you filthy aliens!\n\nCol. Abraham C.
