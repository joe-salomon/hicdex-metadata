Children were told to \"keep away from the marl-pit or rawhead and bloody bones will have you.\"\n\nRuth Tongue said in Somerset Folklore that he \"lived in a dark cupboard, usually under the stairs. If you were heroic enough to peep through a crack you would get a glimpse of the dreadful, crouching creature, with blood running down his face, seated waiting on a pile of raw bones that had belonged to children who told lies or said bad words. If you peeped through the keyhole he got you anyway.\"\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPVHRUErU2cdEUvH3qUZvuuGNT728RJxcJMJXGzjKQfZx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRVrRKwTUAPRYhWSg376zBSBavRgDaB3Djaosd5xnQmJy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPVHRUErU2cdEUvH3qUZvuuGNT728RJxcJMJXGzjKQfZx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fdyejDESzzH8wiVq6WBBJnfyPdCN5xBjn"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
