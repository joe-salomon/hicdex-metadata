We started off a shabby punk rock party in abandoned restaurant on Khaosarn Rd. In the past 19 years we threw our parties in various spaces; bars, clubs, galleries, park, street, bus, boat or even on a plane. Can't believe we come this far.\n\nFor our birthday party this year, with pandemic situation we can't have a big party like every year but we would love to introduce you to our permanent home \"Bar Mischa Cheap\" on Khosarn Road, the street where we were born. The bar is under construction but it's good enough for a little gathering.\n\nUse this NFT as a ticket to get in. Hope to see you :-)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdkjMjnYiQGi58Y6nRchsCSVpUnaK4uQrC17NyA8pskVz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbRGUMcbRzYEkCqkgfGM3Bx5XFCH9zQ3r1j68ddMQPyvN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdkjMjnYiQGi58Y6nRchsCSVpUnaK4uQrC17NyA8pskVz", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1R4z5SJVUSUHpfSRXuLrP1WFnfnyaz9HmJ"], "tags": ["dudesweet", "bangkok", "thailand", "Party"], "extra": {}}
