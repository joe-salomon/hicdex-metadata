My friends acted very confused and weirded out I took a picture of trash. One asked \u201cwhat ARE you doing?\u201d I responded - it\u2019s art.\nI tried to submit this piece multiple times as a teenager to school and local art shows for it to be rejected. I still held the photo tho because I thought it was valuable and honestly pretty.
