The works suffered enormously in the process, losing a large amount of paint.\n\nThis feed from the old galleries demonstrates how digital enhancements have altered the images over time, we see distinct fluctuations in hue and saturation which obscure our perception of the original work.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSg4SbUL3WhuocVAxfjRYUZURuK4k5wxWxZZTCq4QruNj", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1w82sYnBCMNZfDSGggx7ZS8KRcDRbrf7JmnxCqDvFDB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSg4SbUL3WhuocVAxfjRYUZURuK4k5wxWxZZTCq4QruNj", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1f9TBznxnaPVmh6V7JRXQYK3qkPQfFn5wV"], "tags": ["remastered", "goya"], "extra": {}}
