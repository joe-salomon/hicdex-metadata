In the animation, the museum\u2019s architecture has been simplified and positioned on a small island, appearing like a futuristic bunker or an insular fortress. As such, this work is meant to be a playful and critical commentary on western cultural institutions and their architectures, as structures and symbols of centralized power. \n\n100% of the proceeds from the primary sale of this artwork will be donated to Urban Native Youth Association. https://unya.bc.ca/ \n\n1280 x 800 pixels, 384 frames, 256 colors, 25 fps, 2021.
