Left that cause I conquered every win I wanted. Design and UX got me 3 years ago, Art got me 2 yeas ago and for the last year I create art and concepts in the NFT space. I explore, I dig into new tech, I experiment and express! I dig into wins and I am competitor with myself! Hardworker and believer. WGMI guy!\n\nNot many people know what kind of dedication, persistence and control are required for 75kg person to Deadlift 250 kg. And I am willing to put even more in the fulfilling act of creating nft art.\n\nThe source material of this was video of me DEADLIFTING 250 kg and a digital collage of some of my favorite trashart works. Video was sequenced into separate images, They were given style via AI. Made additional drawing and clearing before all was combined with another AI tool. Glitches, sound and editing done manually. \n\nBruta. 01.11.2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaaGTuScXsyx2UuZZkFypCEYD5YpbbtntDfUow3ruLy6u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUp3uNZ96qznYw3iwDE7JLnkt9GpK9QZusZgxQmcwgMED", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaaGTuScXsyx2UuZZkFypCEYD5YpbbtntDfUow3ruLy6u", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ez9EzqaaZWWTuYiRsPKKm3UrDQP3owYva"], "tags": ["trashart", "deadlift", "brutalisti", "trash", "glitch", "GAN", "AI", "soundon", ""], "extra": {}}
