Every number you see is the corresponding amount of TWh usage of a random day ranging from 2010-2021. The higher the jump, the higher the realized gain growth.\n\n(It should be noted that the 4000+ samples were formatted to whole numbers, which explains why some values show up as \u201c0\u201d)\n.\n11.16.21\n1920x1920", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUAH5ARXrP6JkquZiTYzdUwJb7WYzbF93ui5zcVgLAJXK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmViAU98H1DaFFPzYwPLsycjKW7pW9zxc2octG2L6QcncR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUAH5ARXrP6JkquZiTYzdUwJb7WYzbF93ui5zcVgLAJXK", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1dRE4DecACtjxqwsCfa8DKejWyUC9ia512"], "tags": ["touchdesigner", "blender", "codeart", "contemporary", "contemporary3d", "newmediaart", "generative", "generativeart", "creativecodeart"], "extra": {}}
