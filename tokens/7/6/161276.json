Local blockchain enthusiasts were enlisted to walk the group through the basics of blockchain, and the recent rise of NFTs as art. Topical issues related to this phenomenon were explored and discussed \u2013 from the basics of private currencies, digital money, claims to \u201cdecentralization\u201d, the political affiliations and ideologies commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, the electricity usage of \u2018Proof of Work\u2019 consensys mechanisms and emergent alternatives like \u2018Proof of Stake\u2019 and \u2018Proof of Spacetime\u2019.  The session was concluded by a group exercise: minting a collective NFT on a \u2018Proof of Stake\u2019 blockchain. It was decided that a \u2018time capsule\u2019 format would be used, where all artists in the group submitted a file. These would be collectively compressed into a password-protected ZIP file (https://slate.textile.io/ipfs/bafybeih5ardh2bjns72wz5vjvzfqfcocjivyo2mogtvllomfa4fxzbe6eu), which would then be stored on a decentralized storage service (https://slate.host). An HTML file was minted as an NFT, containing the links to this wordpress webpage (https://klassedenny.space/nft). And in order to access the time capsule, a second page (https://klassedenny.space/nft/key) is timed to go live in 10 years \u2013 providing the key to unlock the zip, and reveal the aged files in 2031.  For the NFT, a fixed price was set for sale (1 Tezos for every participating artist), and a german GbR was set up to split proceeds in the future equally among the participants. Further, a 25% resale rate was saved into the Tezos smart contract, so that the minting wallet would receive this percentage whenever sold.
