There is no bright side, only a terrified look of the future. \nFirst experience with watercolor and ink. Some improvements were made on photoshop.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXMYDN3R3frpa6hy6EXpByhK4nv6dYGVcjBRQTvJCpYtQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXMYDN3R3frpa6hy6EXpByhK4nv6dYGVcjBRQTvJCpYtQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXMYDN3R3frpa6hy6EXpByhK4nv6dYGVcjBRQTvJCpYtQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1X9hBgBJhzVEyJsJu1GkFiBFD2Jrgb3vhi"], "tags": ["collection", "portrait", "jpg", "art", "expressionism", "series", "traditionalpaiting", "nft"], "extra": {}}
