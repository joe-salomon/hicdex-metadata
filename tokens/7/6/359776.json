From photo filters, to diets, to cosmetic surgery, is there anything off limits? \n\nAs we preen and pluck away at our flesh, we lose pieces of ourselves in the process while circling around for our next fix.\n\nPUSH, PUSH, IN THE BUSH. The things we do to ourselves in order to be attractive or desirable, to people we find attractive or desirable. Why are we so focused on our external, superficial skin? It will age, wrinkle, scar, and loosen, but what continues to grow and gain strength is what lies within. Our intelligence, compassion, patience, our ability to empathize and to nurture.\n\nSure there are people who aren't intelligent, compassionate, or patient, but those qualities wrapped in an attractive skin, are not at all desirable. \n\nLet's focus on what lies within and not on our skin.\n\nA collaboration between @dehiscenceart (collage titled, \"Ich Glaube, Ich Spinne\") and @helldreamer00 (animation/music) 2021.
