Was going to mint another piece, but the phone that it was on broke. At the same time I salvaged some files from a HD of a meltdown computer from 2014. I found some video from time between 2010-2014. I used to find weird figurines on street markets and make worlds and small videos around them and then integrate them into live visuals. This sequence is originally longer and a recording of a live sessions. Three of the videos overlayed and then glitched. I liked to mess things up for live sessions, certainly not always to everyone's liking. I feel this piece is right because while one vanished into the hardware limbo, another arose from another dead machine. I never thought I would see Skully and co. again. Congrats to all HEN people on more than half a million mints!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV1zZs99gtSwCKEeSP457n3rW7pECnWSL9XtHkZHbMJ3r", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV1zZs99gtSwCKEeSP457n3rW7pECnWSL9XtHkZHbMJ3r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV1zZs99gtSwCKEeSP457n3rW7pECnWSL9XtHkZHbMJ3r", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1TqDPZMv4bq1WsnJrddopnXhXbwTV8DFwS"], "tags": ["HEN500K", "glitch", "video", "gif"], "extra": {}}
