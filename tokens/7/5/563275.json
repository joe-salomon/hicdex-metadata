All researchers, doctors, soldiers are busy saving themselves instead of looking for solutions.\n\nBut there is a middle-aged scientist who is abandoned by his friendship and dumped by the institution he has been defending. He felt that there was still hope for this city even though it was only equipped with a strong curiosity and the remains of ancient ruins in the sewers of Metahill City. He believes that real healing does not come from biological, religious or generic chemical forces that are available in various corners of clinics provided by the government.\n\nVaccines don't work, drugs don't work, people lose hope... the only way is to turn back time! Only with a 1,000 watt power supply, a female japanese dolphin, a gaming grade computer and a mysterious nameless statue down there.\nSounds ridiculous, but this is humanity's last hope. \n\nWEll, the old wisdom said, \"TIME WILL HEAL\", right? but it will not heal by itself.\n\n(the end) ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSVfYQp8iQrWzbxTPenHWvcnJcrU6rz4RZ6gj6sLb1WcF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSVfYQp8iQrWzbxTPenHWvcnJcrU6rz4RZ6gj6sLb1WcF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSVfYQp8iQrWzbxTPenHWvcnJcrU6rz4RZ6gj6sLb1WcF", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Z3VsEiJo2UJLKGtgsteUaBVhrV4Qbe9xa"], "tags": ["AMJO2", "Tezos", "NFTPrizedMoments", "pixelart", "HEN", "Hicetnuncart", "movie", "movieplot", "storyline", "Sci-fi", "illustration", "pilot", "8bit"], "extra": {}}
