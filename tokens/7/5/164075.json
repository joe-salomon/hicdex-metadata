{"__version": 1, "token_id": 164075, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "OBJKT history (v2)", "description": "This is an updated version of OBJKT#25459 and OBJKT#46415, that stopped working due to changes in the API calls and the H=N smart contract address. Type the OBJKT number and you will get all the associated transactions since the moment it was minted. OBJKTs with a lot of transactions might take time to load, so be patient. Note that this tool depends on API calls and it might break in the future.
