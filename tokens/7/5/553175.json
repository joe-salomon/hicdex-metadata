There\u2019s also vanity and apathy all covered in pink. \"Liquify us\" There\u2019s a color for each moment I wanted to frame. There\u2019s a moment for each memory that holds on to a hue and a contrast. I don\u2019t remember when this relationship began, color and me. I\u2019m sure that along the way I hated it, it was not correct to introduce color to all of my friends so I went with gray. And for a while gray was good, and for a while it wasn\u2019t. And there I was... thinking nothing could define me better than all the strokes that I was forgetting on a paper and not bringing to life, color has been my personality and my mistakes and because of that I\u2019ve decided to liquify us. 1/4 \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSyCQoxs4HzNK6FLG3VuFKCKqsCGBctWHVDt5iNQhLwA5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbNm5rDEizDHZPKhya16tTdXUY6QjX6qPp6TsqmXWQJBM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSyCQoxs4HzNK6FLG3VuFKCKqsCGBctWHVDt5iNQhLwA5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MyVLKn4jt4CAx6QP8fdVG2UgDCXeCm3SD"], "tags": ["colors\uff0cdigitalart\uff0cliquify\uff0cportrait\uff0csurrealart\uff0csurrealism"], "extra": {}}
