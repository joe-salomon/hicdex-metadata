In order to carry out this avenue, some buildings of historical value dating from the colonial period were demolished, while others were reduced in size, such as the Palace of the Condes de la Cortina or the Temple of San Bernardo, and others of recent bill were raised in the so-called \"neocolonial\" style.\n\nThis series of portraits focuses on the people who work on this avenue, people who spend many more hours in the historic center than in their homes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSBhgBkH1RT31g6VCYxLzmo58ow16DQj9t8WMAiGWXhRd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXBUT2iH7WMZHG6irX5ik64GiP5Vq1ksSGZiCH2pUdhJ7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSBhgBkH1RT31g6VCYxLzmo58ow16DQj9t8WMAiGWXhRd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4Q8g7vx5EXGysLkWridBqnbjJXikMYSu"], "tags": ["portrait", "latin", "monochrome", "people", "Mexico", "CDMX.man"], "extra": {}}
