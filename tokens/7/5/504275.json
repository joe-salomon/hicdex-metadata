Its mission given by God was to take care of those who abuse too much of their free will, and even break the eternal laws of this universe, and there with Madrepora they stay much more than trillions of eternities, purifying their soul with this mysterious and powerful being. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZXem3D1ckMJqhZ6BffxnW9sEwN51TfR3ZtjdCz7Us51s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQUDkLkGKDXm7dkbACM1bJWXrqo4kQ13kEE2cSKrdpciF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZXem3D1ckMJqhZ6BffxnW9sEwN51TfR3ZtjdCz7Us51s", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ro3NdaGmfMq9jZNtMUQnWMmA1goKiXPSv"], "tags": ["HEN500KDarwinCryptoDarkLight"], "extra": {}}
