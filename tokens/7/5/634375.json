A tale about perseverance, in which David takes on and defeats the giant warrior using only his smarts and a stone. Famously depicted by Michelangelo's David statue.\n\nFast forward to the present day in 2020 and we as humanity are faced with our own Goliath. An uncontrollable pandemic spread around the globe. Now with the entire planet being affected by this we understand the gravity of the situation at hand, whether it be a virus we\u2019re fighting or other forces at play, there is indeed an energy out to shift the balance of the Universe\u2026 Regardless of our differences, in this moment must unite as one. With diligence, trust and belief we as a whole can come together to triumph against \"the enemy\".\n\nStay vigilant my friends.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTb5UfCfnmGSbcP6xBWk8syLjfUR2hUYXns9kE3NL6zG8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWkjMigBFPeo919jyu6RJS5udqoLxwP6jM45rn8MGtnzL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTb5UfCfnmGSbcP6xBWk8syLjfUR2hUYXns9kE3NL6zG8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1dm89w4H8A4TU94BMQdV3NzsuJXnrxCG5N"], "tags": ["covid"], "extra": {}}
