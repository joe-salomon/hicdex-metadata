These dolls, though typically red and depicting a bearded man (Bodhidharma), vary greatly in color and design depending on region and artist. Though considered a toy by some, Daruma has a design that is rich in symbolism and is regarded more as a talisman of good luck to the Japanese. Daruma dolls are seen as a symbol of perseverance and good luck, making them a popular gift of encouragement.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ9vfy2LXo6rNgLS2RimjvbmPkejWRfdNkz3b6pL7MNqC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZwzXxhDV35ssb4nbd1fV8HaUboiGRyyhUzt4gWrzZYRb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ9vfy2LXo6rNgLS2RimjvbmPkejWRfdNkz3b6pL7MNqC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UtykaYBGprV4nHEUMrF3FSpvemAi9S6uq"], "tags": ["daruma", "trippy", "psychedelic", "rarejarz", "woodenlid"], "extra": {}}
