{"__version": 1, "token_id": 394875, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Unconscious", "description": "Conscious things are much more interesting to them. They deliberately ignore what I say. They perceive it unconsciously, therefore there is no interference from consciousness.\n And it is very important that a person understands that his unconscious is smarter than he. A wealth of material is stored in the unconscious. We know that the unconscious can act on its own, and it is important to reassure your patient that this is possible. They need to be willing to let their unconscious work and not rely so heavily on their conscious mind. This is a great help in their inner work. And so your technique is built around directions that allow their conscious minds to withdraw from the task and shift it to the unconscious.\nArtwork by Maksym Denysenko spray paint on canvas in 2016 3424x2583 pix", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmat3uZqCTJaskntC6n89qvRnGwsrmscuvpDhWotGKpCbh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmayQ7KFAJig2nCuBhsPURT1EePQKiozfKjEdFGSkdeFzQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmat3uZqCTJaskntC6n89qvRnGwsrmscuvpDhWotGKpCbh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["colorful", "painting", "spraypaint", "Maksymdenysenko", "artist", "denysenko_art"], "extra": {}}
