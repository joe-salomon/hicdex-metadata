You are sure that this reflection is your voice. The voice sings with you, it is silent with you! But his song is not your song! ... this feeling; It was exactly the narrator of my days!\n\nThe last days of spring 2007 were the end of college and college. Those days could be the beginning of my carefree period. In those days, it was the gateway to the real world.\n\nI remember well that I had ideas about the world around me, which after a short tour, among people I had known in a different way, these ideas were shattered.\n \nI was like a man who suddenly wakes up and does not know it is time of night or day? I Didn't know Do I had to give up or start?\n\nIt was as if I opened my eyes and saw that I was born into a world of unknown words and my first reaction to it was fear! ... I'm not ashamed to say it! ... I was scared.\n\nWe are all afraid of other languages! We are afraid because we do not know what the meaning is behind the words! Fear like the fear of the darkness, the fear of unknowing, not knowing the purpose of others! It is like being with others, but you are separate and alone!\n \nThe album \"Millions Alone\" was written in 3 months and it is my first experience in presenting coherent non-verbal music. This album; My first dialogue with the world around me is in the language of music.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSjsrjSCEA8UQn2TK2VoPn9meTYSJrTVPwRsjQonp3X2j", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmepoiZZzLr1eEaSVEFovwWshCgGeoAvRXyfDhpJfMiX7m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSjsrjSCEA8UQn2TK2VoPn9meTYSJrTVPwRsjQonp3X2j", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XwW4rKyYiCcV7pgdx7eXZtfZUtRZ4qgfc"], "tags": ["Music", "Instrumental", "chill-out", "Electronic", "Orchestral", "NFT", "hicetnunc", ""], "extra": {}}
