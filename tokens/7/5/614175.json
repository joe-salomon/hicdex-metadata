I can't help but imagine that even if he came back from the dead as a walking corpse that he would still be rocking his wig and looking as stylish as always\n\nZombie Warhol White Acrylic frames will initially be limited to 100 editions and will be given to folks on twitter, discord and other social media outlets. After 24 hours of the initial sale going public, the remaining editions will be burned.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmezbo5ueZeXueSR6uGMaSezmhq7cGicLkZd37jxwH3igW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYY44tnuE9B46G6Jivv8jpJEy5byrxZLDrdnqjKYGJ3tU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmezbo5ueZeXueSR6uGMaSezmhq7cGicLkZd37jxwH3igW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["popart", "andywwarhol", "undead", "zombie", "warhol", "zombieart", "art", "horror", "goofy", "undeadart", "stylish", "artist"], "extra": {}}
