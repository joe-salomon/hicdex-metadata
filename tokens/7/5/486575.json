In \u201cCold Shoulder\u201d, the artist investigates the term literally. Defined as \"A display of coldness or indifference, intended to wound.\"\nHistorically the origin of this expression which is often repeated is that visitors to a house who were welcome were given a hot meal but those who weren't were offered only ' cold shoulder of mutton'. This is repeated in several etymological texts, including Hendrickson's usually reliable 'Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins'. There's no evidence to support this view though and it appears to be an example of folk etymology. The first reference to the phrase in print is in Sir Walter Scott's 'The Antiquary', 1816: \"The Countess\u2019s dislike didna gang farther at first than just showing o\u2019 the cauld shouther\". 'Cauld' is Scottish dialect for 'cold'. alison williams 2010 video 16:9 stills\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYfrrfox3svuFCTnKkjeLWeYTFqx4rJA2hTfnUUarroGP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYfrrfox3svuFCTnKkjeLWeYTFqx4rJA2hTfnUUarroGP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYfrrfox3svuFCTnKkjeLWeYTFqx4rJA2hTfnUUarroGP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2GrFRgAWXLhT62DM7b9WMqhEsBH1bWR93u"], "tags": ["#coldshoulder#NFT#videoart#videonft#hicetnunc2000#hicetnunc#cryptoart#NFTcollectors"], "extra": {}}
