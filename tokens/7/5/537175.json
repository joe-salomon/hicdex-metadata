The journey and the experience. The travel from point A to point B becomes negligible in exchange for convenience or computational assurance. This image is a seed, a keyframe, a point of reference in Giving Up On The Space Between (objkt #534827). This series explores methods of transitions through various machine-generated paintings. The AI model attempts to find the similarities between the artworks and paint the hidden divergent spaces. We must be the custodians of the interpolations between our thoughts and our actions; even when implemented via machine.\n\n3072x3072 pixels | Ryan Thompson, November 2021 | www.ryanthompson.name", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdHzkWztaH3zJVESpfSH99SgmDW8z4Ur9YGASDGtnF69E", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcHebfmvheBYkx4itqjf2twB1ivcJm6QgFCKYL97A7vMk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdHzkWztaH3zJVESpfSH99SgmDW8z4Ur9YGASDGtnF69E", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YokFzMR1hX4m4aBqgutxLSUKFDdNoYGEN"], "tags": ["computationaldesign", "ryanthompson", "creativecode", "ai", "abstract", "motiondesign", "machinelearning", "postphotography", "neuralnetworks", "gan", "computerart", "generative", "code", "loop", "aiart", "artificialintelligence"], "extra": {}}
