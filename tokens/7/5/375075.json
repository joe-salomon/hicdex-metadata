They had been on strike since March 12 to raise their wages and achieve a best deal. (For example, unlike whites, African-American workers were not paid when sent home due to bad weather.) 1 2 3\n\nOn April 3, King returned to Memphis and addressed a group of people, giving the speech titled \"I've been to the Mountaintop\" (\"I have gone to the top of the mountain\" in Spanish) at Mason Temple. Church of God in Christ, Inc.-World Headquarters). King's plane was delayed due to bomb threats against him.\nMartin Luther King is shot in the head by a sniper while greeting his followers from the balcony of the Lorraine motel, accompanied by his collaborators, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson. King, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize four years earlier for his work on behalf of racial equality and civil rights, was 39 years old. The attack causes stupefaction in the nation and is the beginning of serious disorders and fires that spread to other states, resulting in about 50 deaths.\n\nDEFEAT is a collection based on people whose death historically had an impact on power, quite remarkable in history, either by homicide, convictions or natural deaths, these people marked the beginning, or the end of a corrupt era within universal history.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd9jRBWLffo6KzePyseGRVwwbcvLSgAoxYexvw98F9ug9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbGneDAccroERYSx7AnXVWQa5tcmsAhGKqEm9uR7Amw1o", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd9jRBWLffo6KzePyseGRVwwbcvLSgAoxYexvw98F9ug9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eCSidkZBu6nXnmAzAqGZvbUER7xBCitzf"], "tags": ["pixel", "collection", "digital", "arte", "assassination", "illustration", "art", "defeat", "magnicidio"], "extra": {}}
