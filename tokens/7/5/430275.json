It is a huge species, it may reach an astounding 12 meters in height. The individuals have a very thick skin, able to easily survive in harsh sandstorms.\nScarabeus has constant connection with other parts of its spirit, those who are mostly creatures living in dense oceans on different galaxies, so it dreams of swimming, while it helps to keep the wind flow in its own planet.
