During this era of civil unrest and anti-war protests in Austin, the Ku Klux Klan received permission to march in a pro-Vietnam war demonstration. They were received by a largely peaceful but quite vocal opposing group of citizens and students during this moment in history. This photo shows a good look at some of the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan in the Texas area as they proceed with their march. The men in the dark green shirts are part of the KKK security detail. Taken with a Praktica FX2 camera on 35mm Kodachrome film.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcUk7ScDTzKsTrvtP1ez4kUi8KBFG9hK3MA3qhihbEhiX", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb18f3LYAvqYSjLeHuhJWxJsaEK9CnPnTZSoWUgyx7iRQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmcUk7ScDTzKsTrvtP1ez4kUi8KBFG9hK3MA3qhihbEhiX"}], "creators": ["tz1YmwJZfEerVMbc8uuJc7xUzE64ma3Xfu7L"], "tags": ["KKK", "Klan", "Clan", "history", "protest", "Vietnam", "Austin", "Texas", "series", "peace", "60\u2019s", "civilrights", "anti-war", "city", "1965", "march", "black", "lives", "matter", "blm", "white", "supremacy", "security", ""], "extra": {}}
