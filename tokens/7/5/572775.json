I have gut feelings about people and their intentions that I usually ignore but they turn out to be right. This piece is a reminder for those who have such instincts and to trust them or it will manifest a black hole that will eat away at you from the inside. It also resonates that feeling of not being able to get over trauma or pain which will see no closure.
