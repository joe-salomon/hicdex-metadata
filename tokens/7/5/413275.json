Al-Ahad is the One who was, is, and will ever remain alone. No one can ever be equal to Him in essence of all His beautiful attributes!\n\nSay, \u201cHe is Allah, [who is] One (Quran 112:1)\n\nFor your god is one God, so to Him submit. And, [O Muhammad], give good tidings to the humble [before their Lord] (Quran 22:34)\n\nOne of the worse things is to make associations with Allah. Here\u2019s passage from Quran regarding this:\n\nAnd they say, \u201cThe Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.\u201d You have done an atrocious thing. The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation. That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant. He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting. And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone. Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds \u2013 the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection. (Quran 19:88-96)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdY3TBJirppKG2ho47YKTnunCLfxtb886PmSGSinYxddB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUC3FLounMRws9Kfvpd12tcutrHFzSnqdtfxxx96bub7Y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdY3TBJirppKG2ho47YKTnunCLfxtb886PmSGSinYxddB", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["god", "asmaulhusnanft", "1of1", "religion", "moslem", "islam", "asmaulhusna", "allah"], "extra": {}}
