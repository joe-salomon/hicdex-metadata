In honor of this spooky holiday, I did a watercolor of Pikachu and his pals on their journey to get as many Rare Candies as they can before the night ends!\n\nHope you all have a safe and happy Halloween.  Whether you're going trick-or-treating with your kids or partying with your friends.  Stay safe.  Stay happy.
