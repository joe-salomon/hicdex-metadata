Below is a poem inspired by the artwork & various life circumstances. I create from the heart, always in all my various forms of media. I hope it shows more & more as time goes on.\n\nYou approached me\nwith warm intentions\nyet somehow over time\nthey went cold,\nnow we're frozen over.\nWhere did you leave them?\nCan we find them again?\nThat warm intent of yours,\nwhere did you leave it?\nIt's all I wanted love,\nit's all I ever wanted.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeih74gar3a2hphuoymtp3yqntzl5shywehop5cjhmqtqkctglpfgnm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeia46mc2obw4mkc7sdpivaqiutilqcklnvbbb7tf7zeny5ogjgkp3m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeih74gar3a2hphuoymtp3yqntzl5shywehop5cjhmqtqkctglpfgnm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hMVUBL9X749hPqxUNjG1V6CK4Cb8M1EZL"], "tags": ["abstract", "digitalpainting", "digitalcollage", "collage", "painting", "poetry", "poem", "writing", "originalpoem"], "extra": {}}
