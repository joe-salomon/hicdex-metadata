This series is about geometric shapes, compositions and simplicity.

The more you look and examine, the more fascinating details you find. Sometimes the less is definitely more.\n\nSize: 3500 x 3500 px / Format: jpg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVPMjH98HvSkVjXBXiLTgGuhQwqr2Jz17fVZsFQcZ99ua", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUqbLp87ch9U3ETsiySD4nea2K4GBiAYN4sgFRpYCqDjW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVPMjH98HvSkVjXBXiLTgGuhQwqr2Jz17fVZsFQcZ99ua", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TSqWk6wy9A9FQt8Ecj772f1c7UncyafoT"], "tags": ["minimalism", "art", "geometry", "simplicity", "art", "minimal", "design", "geometric"], "extra": {}}
