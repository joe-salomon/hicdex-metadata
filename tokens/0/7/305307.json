I was afraid to take images head on, so in order to build confidence I took all my photographs through the window. When I first started shooting I wasn't to fond of this practice, but looking back at these images always re-sparks my interest in these type of photos.\n\nMy tribute to @jjjjjohn Window Still Life #OBJKT4OBJK\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYTHgDQdj35cauLA4o3PG4ivZQ7Curche7QNaXqxDxpUi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUxfSxDsoJ1tRBJdcWUJ6qnsRVjWqjo5CcNuLz68XePM9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYTHgDQdj35cauLA4o3PG4ivZQ7Curche7QNaXqxDxpUi", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bcX8AVkdUvAzSXuctK8o2zKQLJVCU8Qoz"], "tags": ["bnw", "keenanrivals", "ttw", "photography", "blackandwhite", "streetphotography", "objkt4objkt", "throughthewindow", "street", "jjjjjohn"], "extra": {}}
