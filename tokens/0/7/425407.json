It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus Pan. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that Pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is humans' closest living relative.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbA84LyBQB8YmiWznrz3jfnzL2HfaCRiYzkLg92ooJa1t", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSSHDkaofGFjf3rQUefZLRzPMum8BVqiGyLjfMbFrdZLo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbA84LyBQB8YmiWznrz3jfnzL2HfaCRiYzkLg92ooJa1t", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cYeLzaQ5mPLdJGj4CRdZbWJheFcDtZRtc"], "tags": ["2D", "draw", "apes", "ape", "nft", "nftdrop", "drawings", "animal", ""], "extra": {}}
