In the Knesset of Israel, the Speaker of the Knesset is Mansour Abbas, with whom Naftali built the government in a lie and Ganit Da'at Ha'am.  The two bastards divide the State of Israel into Palestinians constitutionally approve electricity, electricity and other infrastructure for people who stole and took over land by force.  On this day, the thief's prime minister, in collaboration with Mansour Abbas, presented the State of Israel with a tray of money for Hamas and the terrorists.  In a picture taken from the Israeli television screen, on the Knesset channel, Mansour Abbas is photographed answering to conference member Dudi Amsalem, you have lost power, your cars, everything.  The flag at the back was originally the Israeli flag hoisted behind the Speaker of the Knesset and replaced with a painting of the Palestinian flag.  The blood on Mansour's clothes is the blood he shed from the Jews.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeknF7HbkYiPxxpssTMVGHZ9BRjfJ2fguNpQzGYyRbKQq", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdj5XhxCiqtoEza3aheVp39Mf8qhDeQujHHrjmacasyTU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeknF7HbkYiPxxpssTMVGHZ9BRjfJ2fguNpQzGYyRbKQq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Vp57uiqyeqKrUEUsRkp3ZY1i98pYJ5V2g"], "tags": ["Jew"], "extra": {}}
