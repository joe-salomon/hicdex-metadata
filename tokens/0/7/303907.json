For so long I have neglect it, photography serves me as a medium to appreciate where I am, here and now. Never forgetting that life is constantly in movement, changing. Here we are, next second we don't know. To the buyer of this piece, I will gift a print and reveal the special location of this place.\n\nThank you to my friend Braulio Lam for letting me use his music.\nSong: Kinetic 1", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeshuDiqdKZZ9oTkj6pwJYHj9GYumonPFtT7tbYs98Ea1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQN8vAVDqEt6ZNoPZwTpeTqDenfuGV2E8v97HSdDoCfBS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeshuDiqdKZZ9oTkj6pwJYHj9GYumonPFtT7tbYs98Ea1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1W9cbZVq8ic4QViATJjYevUnoiwGc3tXDf"], "tags": ["moment", "gif", "anodetotime", "movement", "life", "nature", "presentmoment", "music"], "extra": {}}
