AS I SIT HERE IN THE SHIP WITH THE OTHER XTZ COMRADES I LONG FOR THE DAY I CAN RETURN HOME TO MY RANDOMLY COMMON SKELES NFT. HOWEVER, NOW IT SEEMS NEW DAYS ARE ON THE HORIZON AS WE HAVE SEEN NEW XTZ COMRADES BE SENT IN AS REINFORCEMENT. MY ONLY HOPE IS BEFORE ALL THIS IS SAID AND DONE IS THAT WE CAN GET A JOHN KAREL NFT INTO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEIR WALLETS.  EVERYONE KNOWS AFTER FIGHTING A LONG BATTLE IN THE MUD THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN A CLEAN NFT. UNTIL WE SPEAK AGAIN MY FRIEND YOU ENJOY THE VIEW OUT OF THAT STILL WINDOW.\n\nMOON SOON,\nXTZ ARSENAL", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcScfjcEpA2VhR39oCEBw4FKPr4o7reHtEAiqSnzUy6G1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcScfjcEpA2VhR39oCEBw4FKPr4o7reHtEAiqSnzUy6G1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcScfjcEpA2VhR39oCEBw4FKPr4o7reHtEAiqSnzUy6G1", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1f5b8bLpX4r6SDbvQmgQBBV8SZCSLsfZZq"], "tags": ["objkt", "digitalmarketing", "nft", "customgun", "xtzarsenal", "xtzcomrade", "moonboots", "tezos", "xtzarmy", "xtz", "3dart", "blockchainmarketing", "tezosarmy", "tezosmarketing"], "extra": {}}
