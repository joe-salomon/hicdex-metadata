{"__version": 1, "token_id": 343407, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Khao Manee Cat", "description": "Khao Manee cats are lithe and muscular with a pure white, short, smooth, close-lying coat. The ears are medium to large and the nose has a gentle curve. The eye colour is the cats' most distinctive attribute and can be anything from blue to amber, yellow or green, or a mixture of blue and any of the other colours. In Thailand the odd- eyed Khao Manee cat is considered to be the best, and is often given as a good luck cat. Sometimes white kittens are born with a small darker mark on the top of the head, which has disappeared by around 1 year of age. This is normal.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQQGWGiCbwkAe6yrGbFyANkuKuWsv5BvnMNWQqCbojstL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQQGWGiCbwkAe6yrGbFyANkuKuWsv5BvnMNWQqCbojstL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQQGWGiCbwkAe6yrGbFyANkuKuWsv5BvnMNWQqCbojstL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["pixel", "pet", "animal", "objkt4objkt", "pixelart", "cat"], "extra": {}}
