For I can't see\nA reason for the suffering and this long misery\nWhat if every living soul could be upright and strong?\nWell then I do imagine\nThere will be sorrow\nYeah, there will be sorrow\nAnd there will be sorrow no more\n(Bad Religion - Sorrow)\n 2848 x 4288 \nJpeg", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSMe2bE3EkV1uPEpv5fA2dTPHRPoWyLN7Dodwknd4JDXW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYh5X6sF7KiPhtvamMCj1PZDbzTBt4F56omQ8bBCDxQ38", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmPwnTDtFRF3ZnQQchxQKhbRRN6ZS7nXKkC12KUmquXsZM", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmSMe2bE3EkV1uPEpv5fA2dTPHRPoWyLN7Dodwknd4JDXW"}], "creators": ["tz1dpS3Gi9U8VzCvrn3xAiJLUKdpJd9gVcP4"], "tags": ["Sorrow", "Depression", "Sad", "Photography", "Photo", "Human"], "extra": {}}
