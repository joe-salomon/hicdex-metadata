If it hits the left, the right or the top edge of the space too many times, it will pop. No-one knows how many or how few knocks will be enough to destroy. It\u2019s at once both random and pre-ordained, like fate.\n\nThis is playable so you can knock the balloon with a mouse clicks or a touch. A knock towards the top will nudge the balloon down. On the left will nudge it to the right. On the right will nudge it to the left. But beware, if you knock it towards the bottom you\u2019ll hasten its trajectory towards the top.\n\nHow long can you keep the balloon alive?\n\nYou cannot save the balloon. It will pop. The game here is futility and death is inevitable.
