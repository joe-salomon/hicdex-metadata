The spider is overwhelmed by the size and speed of the incoming Box-Elder Bug. Rather than attacking, the spider curls defensively as the bug steps on its abdomen to hold it at bay. After a few moments of sensing the spider with its antennae, the bug continues on its way leaving the predator in its defensive position.\n\n2018. Nikon D60, 55-200mm Lens + 68mm Extension Tube\n\nPhotographed in situ, without the use of artificial lighting or staging.
