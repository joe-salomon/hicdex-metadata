My obsession with the mountains many times guided me.\n\nThat day I reach very high in the Himalayas. The sunrise started when we were up there and I felt grateful and exhausted, after trekking for four days to reach that moment. \nI was in Nepal and the mountain remain inside of me. When I have to take myself to a peaceful place, I think of them.\n\nMountains are respect and humility in the purest form.\nI will keep this moment till my end.\n\nPicture from MARDI HIMAL TREK - ANNAPURNA - HIMALAYAS - NEPAL\nCreated in 2019\n\n3704 x 5185 px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcu53YSaRdCFcY56Ttz9Q4Dv1Lm8U6szyWU8tLAT2vqhb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUSGo8xP8wB2iGjUZjZEx664CUJNsMgJmRST8VtKs3sQS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcu53YSaRdCFcY56Ttz9Q4Dv1Lm8U6szyWU8tLAT2vqhb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ichPK6qRDokxcguriiARTvsLkFzRvoXGp"], "tags": ["photography", "himalayas", "nepal", "asia", "travel", "juancolacioppo", "landscape", "foto", "travel", "photography", "elviajedemisfotos", "monta\u00f1a", "land", "landscapephotography", "viajar", "mountain", "photo", "trek", "mardihimal", "annapurna"], "extra": {}}
