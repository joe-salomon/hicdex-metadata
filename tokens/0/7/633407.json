It's oriented in a portrait style to touch on the ideas of personal view, like profile pictures. Look within.\n\nThe pieces are drawn in Photoshop exclusively, I wanted to make the textures simple and using a variety of shapes and sizes I created this series with the intention of simplicity. The composition is based on human / plant like figures that are moving upward, either like hands or leaves. \n\nMy personal style of using shapes and forms derived from graffiti and abstract mark making is included. I also wanted to touch on hiding small areas of smiley faces as one discovers the piece, there is happiness if you keep looking :)\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZK7kTuVuowKgXGZHDWMc3GJYxV26qEKtfPSMTVetyugY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdX7j5wkkJiAiXPLcaWyYKizWgQQNKYJa831YeXUHduSt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZK7kTuVuowKgXGZHDWMc3GJYxV26qEKtfPSMTVetyugY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Pajdkp6peGQsLShYcA5EhfJ6ND858hn5U"], "tags": ["rainbow", "landscape", "digital", "photoshop", "abstract", "graffiti"], "extra": {}}
