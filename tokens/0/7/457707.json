It is written to be played in an infinite loop. So people who like to work with sound and animation/video might be able to do something cool with it. \n\nNo rules. Free license to use this however you want. Enjoy it as sheet music, or accept the challenge and record it, re arrange it, add more, take away, print it out and make a thousand paper airplanes. Whatever.\n\nMy vision for this is to get some musicians out there to record it as they will, and then mint their work. We are lucky to have so many talented people in the HEN community. Hopefully they will allow visual artist to use the audio recordings of this sheet music with their animations, video, etc. I want to see how creative and open the NFsheeTmusic community will be. I invite others to use the hashtag and do this as well.\n\nPlease feel free to tag me on twitter with what you create!!! I may buy a few of the pieces(hopefully your awesome enough to send me a copy or two though!).\n\nThis is the first community driven project I'm starting up, so bare with me on the bumps, and buckle in for a wild ride through the unknown.\n\nHave Fun everybody!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWasQCkYcgFWNmDbAni5k6jd18eaGN9zzV4TyFu9jDCDc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRVaSFqSWNkPaqxeT4KqwwoEsqG2y5QWNjm74BKpASThJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWasQCkYcgFWNmDbAni5k6jd18eaGN9zzV4TyFu9jDCDc", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1SGi6muypKkTWpc4LC18a7GHp2HE8Gq7BS"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
