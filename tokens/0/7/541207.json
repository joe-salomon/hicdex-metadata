{"__version": 1, "token_id": 541207, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Levitate Me", "description": "This painting is based on my interpretation of the song \"Levitate Me\" by The Pixies. During the time this piece was being created a good friend's sister took her own life after suffering from a long history of depression. This event had a tremendous effect on myself and fueled the creation of the painting. This painting is dedicated to her.\n\n2011\nMixed media on board \njpeg\n6357 x 9379 pixels\n600 dpi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPSF24iX9z8y72gVz7Zxsxxg2xStFVCjPd9KyJswwHVKx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ2YzsyZBgg6hyCvzfBXGAMi4gB4MsVueKM6u7BGP3Kpi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPSF24iX9z8y72gVz7Zxsxxg2xStFVCjPd9KyJswwHVKx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gmLwV8iyjMBedacsx8n5dw6H6P1BbRshg"], "tags": ["levitate", "levitate_me", "thepixies", "pixies", "life", "death", "ropes", "balloons", "mixedmedia", "nft", "suicide", "depression", "nude", "supernatural"], "extra": {}}
