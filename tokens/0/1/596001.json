The powerful boughs twisted occasionally and stretched themselves. This was an ancient tree growing deep in the centre of the forest, to find it was a difficult thing as it hid amongst the others. Time spent with the tree was magic indeed for it sparked something in those who could see, those who were ready, those who appreciated the special beauty.The silence of the tree filled the forest. It captivated its viewer for hours on end holding them there. In the deepening connection a nugget grew inside the one who watched.\nAfter a time they left the tree and sometime after that the nugget grew and grew inside them until every cell was filled and finally spilled and unfolded out into the world until the end of their days.\n\n'The mission of art is mot to copy nature, but to give expression to it! You are not a base copyist but a poet!' The unknown masterpiece, Balzac.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRjsKWLrJ2WBatDuJ9SUN8JBc9QGz2sWnCErvXEACHu8H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdPuzmWqdRDswxKQphoRCLx7r1j7oGpxcJwZFePN36k1v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRjsKWLrJ2WBatDuJ9SUN8JBc9QGz2sWnCErvXEACHu8H", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
