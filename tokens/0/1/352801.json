{"__version": 1, "token_id": 352801, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Corals #2 | Leptogorgia virgulata", "description": "Leptogorgia virgulata, commonly known as the sea whip or colorful sea whip, is a species of soft coral in the family Gorgoniidae. It is found growing on rocks at depths down to 20 metres (66 ft) along the western fringes of the Atlantic Ocean, commonly found on the coastal shelfs of Southern states and on rock and limestone edges.[7] The range extends from Chesapeake Bay south to the Gulf of Mexico and the species also occurs in Brazil.[5] It is found on shallow water reefs, and also in estuaries and bays as it can tolerate low levels of salinity,[6] but it typically prefers high salinity environments.\n\nI made this piece while exploring a simple growth system but this time I used Perlin Noise for the rendering of the corals. It is part 2 of a series of 3 of this series.\n\n20x20 inches\n7500 x 7500px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcvqv8SkEmzBiKGT5tCo1CFWxxb9GohrC3qrLakjzYNm5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRvmow6GQ29vc3bReKGiZFhev8dQZT82JYAXDH7L4dpyb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcvqv8SkEmzBiKGT5tCo1CFWxxb9GohrC3qrLakjzYNm5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aTHPgADTSw2a7kZe9b1ASpYvNmkc1vNDB"], "tags": ["javascript", "p5", "generativeart", "art", "genartclub", "processing", "generative", ""], "extra": {}}
