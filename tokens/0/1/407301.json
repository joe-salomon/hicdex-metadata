This woman always wears a red or black dress to delight lonely men who drink in a bar.\n\nShe is a lost soul with a young and seductive body that approaches lonely men leaving them enchanted.\n\nThe girl quickly asks the man to take her back home and he, enchanted by the girl's beauty, readily accepts. When they come across a high wall, she descends and invites you inside.\n\nWhen the lonely man realizes that it is a cemetery, the girl disappears and the church bell rings that it is midnight. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeunF53tVa7AeBs2KPd1ug7SeEf2gM7cuN5crbG1eDznn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWNv2X9Lr3bvakiHkbRezm8wJVieSW85tbViCmDQfcrAJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeunF53tVa7AeBs2KPd1ug7SeEf2gM7cuN5crbG1eDznn", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["legends", "brazil", "cryptolegends", "characters", "forest", ""], "extra": {}}
