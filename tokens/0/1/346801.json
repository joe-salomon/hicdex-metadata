Divided into a number of ranks within this category, oiran were considered \u2013 both in social terms and in the entertainment they provided \u2013 to be above common prostitutes, known as y\u016bjo (\u904a\u5973, lit. 'woman of pleasure').Though oiran by definition also engaged in prostitution, they were distinguished by their skills in the traditional arts, with the higher-ranking oiran having a degree of choice in which customers they took, and the highest-ranking oiran, known as tay\u016b, not engaging in sex work at all.The term \"oiran\" originated in Yoshiwara, the red light district of Edo in the 1750s, and is applied to all ranks of high level courtesans in historical Japan.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTZHduGE8ZHTXTpusarVEH9cBcMaUPMcgBHgDZxN1e3U8", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4qSK5iopcEyxq3dBuMK1vGoenWxAVCz5BPUn5BqXfSt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTZHduGE8ZHTXTpusarVEH9cBcMaUPMcgBHgDZxN1e3U8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1aAX5PQPrWnzehpxKC6vhDrjbea9UCpaJ4"], "tags": ["digital", "art"], "extra": {}}
