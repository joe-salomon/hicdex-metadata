Joining the military has taken me away from being fulfilled spiritually. There hasn\u2019t been time to take myself out of the current setting and reconnect with God. A few days ago, I\u2019ve reconnected and invited God back into my heart initiated by the love of my life. It\u2019s time to turn a new chapter of my life and live only through love and light. Thank you for everyone supporting me and giving me the strength to keep going. I will forever be grateful of you. Once I\u2019m settled down in my new duty station, I\u2019ll do a hoodie giveaway.
