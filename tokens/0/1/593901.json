{"__version": 1, "token_id": 593901, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LC 02 - The Jester", "description": "LOST CASES - The Jester\n(from the DARK series)\n\n\"In a land governed with fear and surrounded by misery, the Jester provided the temptation of hope. Every night, she would perform in The Royal Court for the Ladies of Horror and only on special occasions would be presented in front of The Emperor himself. She committed a grave sin by falling in love with laughter and was banished to the Underveil, an underground asylum in the lower parts of the kingdom. She was labored to the horrific task of making the captives laugh while bearing witness to them, being mercilessly torn apart. Her laughter perished that night and the Jester was never heard from again. To this day, the Great halls of the kingdom echo with faint screams and despair.\"\n\nCurrent holders of \"THE ELDER\" have been sent this piece to their wallets. Not only is this a token of appreciation to all the holders but also these special daguerreotypes possess utility that will be applicable very soon. \n--\nLOST CASES offer extended insight regarding the background and expand with hints on the lore that not only give you the chance to piece the puzzle but also provide the timeline of events within the DARK universe.
