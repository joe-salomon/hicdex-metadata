I chose to create an old Wizards reading spot. The goal of this course was not to create game ready assets, but more to learn ZBrush and sculpting hard surface objects in a more stylized way. I chose to do a quick ZRemesh and unwrap so I could get them into substance painter and practice some stylized texturing in there, which is something completely new to me. I had so much fun creating this! Let me know what you think!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNYX5PC4H2CgR896MkacPz6oCmunKTo8PAWFVUMsk8Y6d", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZFoEX1RjenViSK6zgXfLXxUPdJKT2wxa7uLcfWLufhr3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNYX5PC4H2CgR896MkacPz6oCmunKTo8PAWFVUMsk8Y6d", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1e4kxCf7UXR1UvKib4zPESfsdfPShwgNir"], "tags": ["Wizard'sReadingNook"], "extra": {}}
