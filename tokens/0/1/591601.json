Generated by a hand-coded python application, it is the first objkt series minted by @TheMaxBore. The Pessimist series is built on an instruction set that combines rectangles, ellipses, clipping paths, and fills to create geometric, conceptual, modern works that are structured in their composition, but organic in their rendition. All quantities, sizes, positions, and pallets are generated by the application. xi-14662 arranges shapes, colors, and fills to create a remarkable example of how randomness can produce results that seem anything but random. The art exists as an svg to preserve the integrity of the original and allow viewing and reproduction at any size.\n\nGenerative art created by MaxBore.\nOfficial wallet: maxbore.tez\nOfficial Twitter account: https://twitter.com/themaxbore", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWJXPiAgVZT2Ljz61o92RAossiVaDmRZ1namnvr4yz3NP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWJXPiAgVZT2Ljz61o92RAossiVaDmRZ1namnvr4yz3NP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWJXPiAgVZT2Ljz61o92RAossiVaDmRZ1namnvr4yz3NP", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1fZnsguzqqSryegHiirsUVnNJmJcqUbtWR"], "tags": ["abstract", "abstractart", "algorithmicart", "art", "artoftheday", "codeart", "conceptualart", "contemporaryart", "creativecodeart", "design", "digitalart", "generativeart", "generativeartist", "generativearts", "generativeartstudio", "generativearttoys", "generativedesign", "geometricart", "graphicdesign", "mathart", "modernart", "nft", "proceduralart", "processart", "visualart", "MaxBore"], "extra": {}}
