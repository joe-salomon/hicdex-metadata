Those who one-eyed the soul, who knows what the shadow holds? What treasure is left untold?\n\nAs the desire to be figured out is inevitable, this \u201cproject\u201d is made as a coping mechanism to uncover creator\u2019s shadowed thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe title always simply tells about the artwork, the way to interpret and represent is up to you. The main idea is always the same, to see the beauty over the beast, it's just another side of beauty that is covered by the shadow.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYRMUZQ3GGtuBr3TrmQgqmxNbXKfzDS6NZzviD6cDirWq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUM6tSXCVj1my77sbvYAoasfx21wx4SVYwMyVNSmkPY1e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmbxwecyhRJcQzscog23GCc5xW5HgBuWsvzmpXZXs812jx", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYRMUZQ3GGtuBr3TrmQgqmxNbXKfzDS6NZzviD6cDirWq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1cWLbmsf34rt3K4azx9DoiQkddvLZndMq5"], "tags": ["illustration", "artist", "nature", "beauty", "flower", "snake", "naja", "beast", "beatthebeast", "fantasy"], "extra": {}}
