As tech progresses i vow to keep up and send updated versions of any piece i make to collectors if it provides a better viewing experience for them... that being said even as of now only certain phones have AR capabilities. So if your phone does not support i hope you can still enjoy the 3D experience!\n\n DISCLAIMER: Depending on devices , your AR experience might be different than others! \nInstruction: you can pinch and zoom and move around the ARTOYs in the camera view, it might be not as intuitive tho so just keep messing with it lmao.\nPS. Every ARTOYs will have words or phrases that might be useful to keep in written because they may or may not be used to unlock a \"prize\".\n                                 -BLE77", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaFNHbJG5QR8yzPBaB2ph2xNvtQRGNbPUvbwqhS2k3dLq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWVWNAciNbYiTuefek1Kw4bhuRJfvY1FyMhegC4HoBvxy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaFNHbJG5QR8yzPBaB2ph2xNvtQRGNbPUvbwqhS2k3dLq", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1RauySVaAKZy6S45arKTTqCFVfcAHLZLBw"], "tags": ["ARTOYs", "john", "glb", "3d", "blender", "tribute"], "extra": {}}
