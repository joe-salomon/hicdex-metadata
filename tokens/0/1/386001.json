{"__version": 1, "token_id": 386001, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Poiesis #02", "description": "\"There is no tenderness comparable to that of caressing something that sleeps\" is a verse that comes from the poem Nocturno by Oliverio Girondo.\nThe poem tells us about the inability of human connection in the city and the idea that there is no place for nature in it. So much so that man needs the caress to console himself from the loneliness of the urban night.\n\nGirondo was one of the greatest Argentine poets of the 20th century and perhaps the most avant-garde. His work revolutionizes, with delicacy and finesse, the limits of the poem.
