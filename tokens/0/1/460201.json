Every time you buy 2 or more I use small portions of the profits to help out a small or growing business, a family in need, homeless shelter, the start of a business, and projects to help the community in hopes to be the light of the world to slowly make someones day or life change for the better. Buy 25 and you will get a digital wall piece for free. Whats beautiful to me is making the world a better place and making something out of nothing. follow me on twitter @cannonjones973 and instagram @cannonjones_973\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUegviCk3xywXLTWyz3VnfgqtND5DP355yCmA8gHUZyTM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTNHzaPb2XHZGSWyWozBNSLpCwYkjnepbR5HzbNu6rw7H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUegviCk3xywXLTWyz3VnfgqtND5DP355yCmA8gHUZyTM", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2RWbByYGdhGAoE8EbJ4suxEdJc1FAAmuQq"], "tags": ["#cannonjones#jerseystrong#nftart"], "extra": {}}
