Every image in this series is an individual moment in the Conscious Growth generative timeline, never to be repeated.\n\nConscious Growth is a hybrid of gneural's traditional, freehand art and Cacheflowe's creative coding, brought together through the magic of custom software. The combination of these disciplines merges traditional, hand-drawn illustration and generative digital art.\n\nFormat: 5400 x 7200px PNG file, suitable for printing at 18x24 inches\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTvDhTc46ap6pcLBeqca6GHSLgTM2rZdL1mnGq9X7kZT5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNc3csMAQvRVii8VbjwtsAVZQcPjgyqs3G4bxsthYzqBh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTvDhTc46ap6pcLBeqca6GHSLgTM2rZdL1mnGq9X7kZT5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fyS7MrBNTKNnL8ZBaPqMynyrABquf2VMy"], "tags": ["generative", "illustration", "collaboration", "print", "image", "polygons", "patterns", "colorado", "installation", "concentric", "iterative"], "extra": {}}
