It was a set of cards with an abstract pattern in the middle made of pressed ink. I managed to identify 250+ images from those abstracts ink patterns while other test subjects only identify 20 - 30 images. An initial sign of the light schizophrenic mind.\n\nSince then I learned more about this mental health 'issue' and it explains many things about myself. \n\nSometimes I see the world in a very different view, sometimes the world is much more interesting in my head, sometimes the world in my head is a little bit too real and sometimes my head is much more alive than my body when it mixes with emotions.\n\nI believe this condition is a blessing in disguise that helps me think differently and channel it thru the art that I create.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVXWKkrS2FYjxXNQSXZDAokE5hgpxb8otiaAt1iJ48h2D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVXWKkrS2FYjxXNQSXZDAokE5hgpxb8otiaAt1iJ48h2D", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVXWKkrS2FYjxXNQSXZDAokE5hgpxb8otiaAt1iJ48h2D", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2DoRP4a4gFwxuaGwrnG1jNyKmPPynWWUjB"], "tags": ["Mentalhealth", "gif", "cryptoartweekasia", "rumantra", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}
