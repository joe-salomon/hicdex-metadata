Their creations will be displayed in the picture frame for all to see. If they have not created any OBJKTs their collection is shown instead. Below the frame is the title, creator and price of the OBJKT being displayed. \n\nYou can click the link (open in new tab) to go straight to the OBJKT's page in hicetnunc.\n\n**Disclaimer:\n\nThis is a beta version of this technology. If the hicdex API changes, this will break.\n\nAPI requests are currently rate limited, so refreshing constantly will cause errors. Please wait at least 20 seconds before refreshing again.\n\nCurrently this only queries addresses who have bought this OBJKT, meaning you will still have a chance to appear if you resell.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcyJSwco9Be6wmDSmnMfL4VdcaDDjhrpmVPhJ5mGrJn6H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTEE33Q1LvBGTMeTLduuF949QdxrsFupfkEmZxNfzLZr1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcyJSwco9Be6wmDSmnMfL4VdcaDDjhrpmVPhJ5mGrJn6H", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1gsR67rvm99Cuh1EtqxwSnoKwvtzEMaTS5"], "tags": ["fc43d9f93a3bb", "interactive", "beta", "javascript", "html", "css", "gallery"], "extra": {}}
