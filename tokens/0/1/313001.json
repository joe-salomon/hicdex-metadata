Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYGSFq7gi3DMosLgiJVtinseEqF2cvjViAXjZjnbqioMY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR6s282kew36jHhqxWWmTyp3YzrA35we6fnWNs5iQ1q4i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYGSFq7gi3DMosLgiJVtinseEqF2cvjViAXjZjnbqioMY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1N5YbuVycdtPW38A2q3dLs6sPdQgzevpjP"], "tags": ["photography", "nft", "phoenix", "fenix", "art", "sun", "firework", "fantasy", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
