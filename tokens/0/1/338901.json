{"__version": 1, "token_id": 338901, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Vynr", "description": "Vynr are composed of limbs and appendages that all wrap and converge into a single point. What they lack in physical strength, they make up for with their mastery of and attunement towards negative space. Material is split apart, creating a temporary rift in the world. Despite the brevity of the rift, it often quickly spreads and ripples before finally dissipating, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. With their physical presence being a mixture of positive and negative space, they are highly resistant to their own destructive capabilities, but not entirely immune to prolonged exposure within the Abyss itself.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaTLNBtGBT82EDJRtWZP3MYgFMV2bCZboHhfgaEZhcV5C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmapuBGjhzvSiBQq6QRcEB2WJLFBNhhvVFWqxx3PtiCMNZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaTLNBtGBT82EDJRtWZP3MYgFMV2bCZboHhfgaEZhcV5C", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bAocPoQKdzpsWdN2BxAC3jR32PhqZkX57"], "tags": ["digitalpainting", "graphicdesign"], "extra": {}}
