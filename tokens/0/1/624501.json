We use a Layered Depth Image with explicit pixel connectivity as underlying representation, and present a learning-based inpainting model that iteratively synthesizes new local color-and-depth content into the occluded region in a spatial context-aware manner. The resulting 3D photos can be efficiently rendered with motion parallax using standard graphics engines. We validate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of challenging everyday scenes and show fewer artifacts when compared with the state-of-the-arts.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmatENT1z3iSihgf3KVY5PV68rMQserAG2KPmw7EDoV1bB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmebHYW9Lu6FFDdBA93tsSn9ip5RWTjakEnF4hNvHwq9yM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmatENT1z3iSihgf3KVY5PV68rMQserAG2KPmw7EDoV1bB", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cY5u6TUBth4mRSYhpW1PNBAf6VBYjZbTd"], "tags": ["vqgan", "digitalart", "motiondesign", "3D", "animation"], "extra": {}}
