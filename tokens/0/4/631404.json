The captain was disciplining a crew mate who had caused a brawl over a bottle of rum. The Captain looked fine in his uniform with long dark hair tied at the back. His frame was muscular. His eyes were as blue as the ocean.\n\nThe princess was quite taken by him. She was eager to see how he would deal with the situation. She stopped out of sight and listened.\n\n\u201cWho did the rum belong to he asked the sailor?\u201d. \u201cIt was mine, I found it!\u201d. \u201cYou found it hey?\u201d stated the Captain. \u201cWell if you found it then it wasn\u2019t yours and you had not paid for it. You took what belonged to someone else. You only own something if you have paid for it or have been given it!\u201d said the Captain.\n\n\u201cSo my fine young man you neither owned it or was given it. So it is not yours.\u201d He then went on to say. \u201cWith this in mind you owe your fellow sailor a bottle of Rum. Here is a silver coin. Go buy a bottle then give it back.\u201d \u2013 He paused then said \u201cNow you owe me a days wages which will be deducted from your pay.\u201d", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb7cVgVxaVo87TbQp7B7poYcTfv8AWzsHoRVuBk3jdnoJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb7cVgVxaVo87TbQp7B7poYcTfv8AWzsHoRVuBk3jdnoJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb7cVgVxaVo87TbQp7B7poYcTfv8AWzsHoRVuBk3jdnoJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhqH6bkJkfgdgJbWSnKhUuhPx8aaBV7TQ"], "tags": ["rum", "gistlidia"], "extra": {}}
