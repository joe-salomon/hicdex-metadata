And I also love donuts, don't get me wrong.\n\nBut some of us are so clueless and we do it in the name of so-called \"self-care\" expecting the long-lasting happiness. I know because some people in my circle often make excuse to do that.\n\nI agree with the importance of self-care, but caring oneself is more than giving some treats.\n\nI'm interested in how we expect to have healthy mental states and healthy thoughts when we, ourselves, only eat something that look cute but gave our bodies no nutritions that they need. More arts on this in the making!\n\nP.S It's okay to cry now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWZA2aRRarN5vKU1GBNme7JXVihwjv1LyF2dsQoftUWu1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWZA2aRRarN5vKU1GBNme7JXVihwjv1LyF2dsQoftUWu1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWZA2aRRarN5vKU1GBNme7JXVihwjv1LyF2dsQoftUWu1", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1isv3NsALsXZEEVHPxDRffBnk5mZ1hKQ5h"], "tags": ["self-care", "donut", "donuts", "doughnut", "memes", "selflove", "animation", "bakery", "snack", "sweet", "stopmotion", "cute", "colorful", "handdrawn", "drawing", "sprinkles", "sweet", "foodie", "food", "tasty", ""], "extra": {}}
