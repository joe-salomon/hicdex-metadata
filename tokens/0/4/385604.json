There is no indication that these symbols have any other function than to facilitate the transmission of thoughts during silent rituals and as a frequency indicator during gargling. However, there are older writings that emphasize the function of the symbols as keys. In fact, in some of these very difficult-to-interpret writings, the symbols are not referred to as symbols but as keys.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPZBKN9Ma1xQGibqp78dSQCEqCDsWbFCWkdRobhZ51oYj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRkDi2Hfk87PK1JYM1Hup4hodnELPKDWwhamJLrxdQbKe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPZBKN9Ma1xQGibqp78dSQCEqCDsWbFCWkdRobhZ51oYj", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Nyf292zVjfmg8y99Y3SFA6z3akhbAVHuF"], "tags": ["occult", "theeraofqueenoftheabyss", "symbols", "emblems", "collectibles", "cultafbrockbrock", "meta"], "extra": {}}
