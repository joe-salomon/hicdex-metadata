{"__version": 1, "token_id": 472804, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "GIN KING", "description": "Although there are many examples of syntax crystals within the English language, this one is a very rare example of a palindrome syntax crystal. If you think diamonds are rare, this is rarer. Not only does each line create a new word when we introduce a new letter, but the whole thing can be spelled backwards and forwards. I've chosen specific colors to illustrate the effect. Eventually, I will repeat this pattern into something really interesting; probably will mirror the words to the right and and them mirror both of those underneath. These make for fun educational materials to teach children about spelling, speaking, words formation, and of course abstract thinking. This happens to be one of my personal favorite works. It's so simple, so rare, that it feels like a little egg of amazement. I never get tired to coming back to it. Hope you enjoy it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUasNV2DZdx2NcDCZz2WPSrzcM53THXg9tqpp9UBBNmkH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU7ig2FtvuZvJyR6bsArL8yqBmSXWM2amjvhrtvfhBwSk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUasNV2DZdx2NcDCZz2WPSrzcM53THXg9tqpp9UBBNmkH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
