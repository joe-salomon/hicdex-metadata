I was walking in Tokyo around Akihabara. The sky and colors were surrealist, I was feeling to be in an 80s anime. Waking up us always complicated after such a dream.\n\nFor this photograph I took in Japan, I wanted to give it a vaporwave aesthetic that I love with a purple sky, pink, blue colors and a dreamy vibe.\n\n[Fine Art print for collector]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZxbDR9Bk4fj2cuzA8HMaN7dgDF8KRvwwxwzjeayTQPFa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXPHuT99FDqi5XZQ2Pr7owN9xafXBWFUY5MxvZmEaNxCC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZxbDR9Bk4fj2cuzA8HMaN7dgDF8KRvwwxwzjeayTQPFa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QLaPAN88xQ6MBAZALWsLeukGemgdM4M7e"], "tags": ["art", "beautiful", "blue", "city", "colors", "colour", "cryptoart", "culture", "digitalart", "expedition", "fineart", "landscape", "photography", "surreal", "vaporwave", "aesthetic", "japan", "pastel", "pink", "Cyberpunk"], "extra": {}}
