The skull's resonant frequency is in tune with the electromagnetic field emanated by humans. The POWERSKULL would disintegrate the physical and ethereal bodies of the skull-bearer, to instantly reintegrate them wherever the human so desires.\n\nOther living forms' magnetic fields would not be tuned to the Iridium Teleportation Cranium and would not activate it.\n\nThe POWERSKULLZ are part of the POWERVERSE, a reality where humans have achieved their highest potential and live as gods.\n\n_\nGIF - 50 fps - 1080 x 1080 px\n\n_\nThanks to @billellis for the superb skull model.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXah9aMMhsRx99rGrDxfSYpnXTmqaHRYHNQfCunYsVVan", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXah9aMMhsRx99rGrDxfSYpnXTmqaHRYHNQfCunYsVVan", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXah9aMMhsRx99rGrDxfSYpnXTmqaHRYHNQfCunYsVVan", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cALi4cQRKtSMCU92nkmtQtZPZGppeHke1"], "tags": ["billellis", "cranium.porwerverse", "death", "powerskullz", "skull", "cyberpunk", "glow", "mementomori", "objkt4objkt", ""], "extra": {}}
