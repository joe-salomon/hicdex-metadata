Three stories high it produced electricity for him and his family.\n\nToday he retrofitted it with solar panels, selling electricity collected back to his city's network.\n\nHe is the primary reason for my creativity \u2013 when I was a kid he would spend hours teaching me how to weld, build and modify anything we could think of. Because of him, anything seems possible.\n\n--- \n\nProceeds are used to print the project's photo book \"Markings on the Kitchen Wall\"\nEvery 1/1 holder is able to claim a physical copy for free (no shipping cost)\n1/1s available on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/motkw\n\n---\n\nPicture taken, developed and scanned by Richard David.\nPhotographed on analog film with a large format camera", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCYDcWrxZnMSUGAs3ugSuiuBdbsR9hVpg8VFKc7sAXYK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZbv8e41uZxXvvkaQ23yD2tQw7vcQq6GZ4CxYhipYuvbg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCYDcWrxZnMSUGAs3ugSuiuBdbsR9hVpg8VFKc7sAXYK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YPt35mLaWxZdvUgzz3rvChEbpzyQtanWa"], "tags": ["photography"], "extra": {}}
