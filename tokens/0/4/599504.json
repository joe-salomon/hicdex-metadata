It manifests itself on the end of the year dates, and the legend says it will bring nice things to people with good behavior during the year... However, people who misbehaved or did wrong actions on purpose, no matter how small... They will have to face the consequences, the Animatronic Claus will punish them... So, be good, and you'll be grateful... Merry Christmas :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf5wP2AegSGzDgDDHWGBhR8stprWDbQajTjaM2RsYGHTJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXY8wHP2YhANmWEw5dnXPKbhejU3ywBXRREELCc5SRiFw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf5wP2AegSGzDgDDHWGBhR8stprWDbQajTjaM2RsYGHTJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i3T3yroaR1D3V7HY5oJyd6ZQoyNYxGheB"], "tags": ["Animatronic", "art", "christmas", "gift", "tree", "santaclaus", "red", "xmas"], "extra": {}}
