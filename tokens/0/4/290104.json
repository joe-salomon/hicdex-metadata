This pattern is then replicated manually in a non-adjacent cell. When no non-adjacent cells are remaining, the next available cell is filled - if there is a complete cell above this one, an attempt is made to match as closely as possible the cell above. \n\nThe result is a grid of broadly similar cells that summarises, through a form of abstract visual storytelling, the story of a failed human attempt to mimic the exactitude of mechanical systems. The four images are unique and non-repeatable.  \n\nThe Nucleic Asymptote series is lightly interactive - click to read a machine translation of the original drawing.\n\nCode for interactivity generously provided by Liam Egan - @neuromantic6", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVaqzBHiZPXC2vL3rKpgpeppqMDkTspWBiM2sBdZRBLZA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVZW6JGnoaqcavahNwXvxBq7zjjwP8yuDRdjkHBehRWGY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmcFjEsKYrT9jJpabB6A63KwoFXBsexGgdMfE8p9CeaMM1", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVaqzBHiZPXC2vL3rKpgpeppqMDkTspWBiM2sBdZRBLZA", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["monoguys", "liamegan", "deleuze", "lines", "DNA", "light", "codeart", "genart", "organic", "failure", "systems", "drawing", "blender", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
