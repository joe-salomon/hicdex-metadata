The invigorating feeling when you didn't fall off and rode so fast for the first time...every time. Remembering how it was to see the world through the eyes of a child. Feeling free and like you're riding on the waves.  Having the wind flow onto your face, and seeing the world so vividly.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcm8pf1nbvkqLGEG3xvKoPeHXnkBuXAjP63PexYjANUgH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYmZmCNQnnEe228i9Jw7LvCdaRohEG9o9hKrmimXjreuo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcm8pf1nbvkqLGEG3xvKoPeHXnkBuXAjP63PexYjANUgH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gNpHaAHuChEc94A1F6Cu96uqtDewej6sm"], "tags": ["handpainted", "watercolor", "markers", "vivid", "fantastical", "surreal", "childhood", "bicycle", "waves", "clouds", "ocean", "sea", "jpeg"], "extra": {}}
