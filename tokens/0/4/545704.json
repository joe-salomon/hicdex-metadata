Fragmented, undiscovered and non-assimilated parts of our selves/subconscious, can conflict and compete with each other. This often results in self-defeating behavior, or a lack of will or energy to move towards what we really want in life. This occurs because huge amounts of our mental energies are wasted in conflicts/competition with each other.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUFB3BUjZFckU3PeZG3au9EYE6Ukrs9hPp5pEUNJUJTBg", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmakro6XctAzm1121yyBNQAnjqZSaDiiqxgHAwLRPutiy1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUFB3BUjZFckU3PeZG3au9EYE6Ukrs9hPp5pEUNJUJTBg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UEqCxFos8ViCLUTre9brJSZS7XYbtX9GT"], "tags": ["Meditation", "sunrise", "love", "heart", "light"], "extra": {}}
