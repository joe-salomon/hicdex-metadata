In addition, the show is also often performed as a ritual when a disease outbreak occurs in a village in Bali. As the show's name implies, the mystery about Leak comes from a supernatural being named Calonarang who is the highest ruler of breeding or the science of Leak in Balinese.\nAccording to Balinese belief, Leak is a human who studies magic. But the magic is not balanced with good behavior. That said, the bad side of the figure appears at night where the Leak hunts a small boy in order to need embryonic blood in order to live. It is also said that Leak can turn himself into a pig or a ball of fire, while the real form of Leak has a long tongue and sharp teeth. Some people say that Leak magic only works on the island of Bali, so Leak is only found in Bali.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR4HXVnNMZKgtACnN2C4rPDDcY3Ee8ePa1gEdoVNEJ4XU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSXrvoi6yawPeQcF3PwLaAdZz9G74Yt55FRkdWEvpNeEz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVuL6PWbiG8XPbgLuvSigsQ1DWwQrEajRwVhhrEQwAkfk", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR4HXVnNMZKgtACnN2C4rPDDcY3Ee8ePa1gEdoVNEJ4XU", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Cpe65nW33Fb8MwmuHKFGuc1g3M29Ahkbu"], "tags": ["Bali", "Leak", "Calonarang", "Blackmagic", "art", "traveling", "dance", "performanceart", "historical"], "extra": {}}
