And these can be cut even further into smaller subatomic particles. Many of these particles act like waves and particles and blah, blah, blah. Get on with it Andrew, we know all this from our science classes. Yes, but have you ever considered that we are part of these waves and particles? From the moment of conception to birth to life to death and even beyond we are just recycled atoms and particles throughout the vastness of the cosmos. In quantum field theory we learn that the universe is made up of layers and layer of \"fields\" of particles and these particles are actually waves at the same time. It's a difficult concept to wrap your mind around at first, but that's the universe...just hiding in plain sight. We are the universe experiencing itself. You are the consciousness of the cosmos. Every thought, every movement, every action...EVERYTHING. Everything is a direct result and/or consequence of the universe's existence or whatever you call this thing we call life. By you reading this very sentence, you're part of the universe experiencing itself. It's kind of meta and trippy, but probably true. Either that or I'm just taking way too many cannabis edibles lately.
