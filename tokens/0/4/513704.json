Fasting is an extremely powerful transcendental key, the master-key to connect to your spirit, to consciousness, to eternity, to everything. There are no other messages or advices, this is the only message, the only advice. Everything else, every detail you\u2019ll find out yourself as you start using the key. There are different kinds of creatures selling their \u201cfishes\u201d, but with this key you can connect to your spirit and you\u2019ll find out how to catch your own.\n\nI don\u2019t want to sell you anything, (except my amazing NFTs :P - this would be the worst strategy, fasting is not a bestseller topic) I don\u2019t want to change the world neither, I\u2019m confident with everything, so if you think that this is just bullshit, it\u2019s okay, but you really don\u2019t have much to lose if you give it a chance\u2026 Whatever problems you have, you can solve everything by fasting. If you\u2019d like to try, you don\u2019t have to buy anything, because you literally don\u2019t need anything, not even food, 2 bottles of water/ day, that\u2019s all. Disseminating this type of information has no benefit, but it certainly has an effect for sure, that \u201cnormal\u201d people would think that I\u2019m a crazy mentally sick loser (and that\u2019s also okay, 10 years ago I\u2019d have thought the same way), so why would I then go into a bar Saturday night and preach about fasting and praying, to the drunk guys around? I think, that humor is an important key of this material dimension, if you have good sense of humor, you already know everything, you can unlock pretty much doors with it, and doors that can\u2019t be opened with humor, are not even worth opening at all\u2026 :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcyWZ5CZMoadFTdedmqNDkmWjzttBarHM7uE8rag6mPF5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcyWZ5CZMoadFTdedmqNDkmWjzttBarHM7uE8rag6mPF5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcyWZ5CZMoadFTdedmqNDkmWjzttBarHM7uE8rag6mPF5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iofz19pHfHgwM1zb5iuoLwzshJbTFQBWc"], "tags": ["chocolate", "brownie", "vanilla", "icecream", "fasting", "spiritual", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
