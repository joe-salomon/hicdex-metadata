The man\u2019s hand lovingly scratches his dog\u2019s side while he keeps his face down and his hand out. Does he keep his pet for comfort, protection, or is it that people are more sympathetic to the plight of an animal? \n\nThe monochromatic, grainy nature of these shots lends a sense of anonymity to the subjects, people who are so often treated as invisible despite the fact that they are living in plain sight. By placing people experiencing homelessness as the central subject of this series, we are forced to confront the lived realities of homelessness and urban poverty as experienced around the world. \n\n102,400 represents the ISO or Film Speed that my camera is set to capture these images.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTWoxY97XwqJ5cNr1yjGRSkXm1GFmPRUQdaPfKW1TUE6v", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcBSkWsnmcfDpVz98pACrtoBgMaqRFqp5C2NPwKnUoddG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTWoxY97XwqJ5cNr1yjGRSkXm1GFmPRUQdaPfKW1TUE6v", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Fm2Ax1h2cAuFo996rptPW279HSzThdzSy"], "tags": ["homeless", "street", "streetphotography", "mono", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "grain", "prague", "czechrepublic", "czech", "euro", "europe", "beg", "beggar"], "extra": {}}
