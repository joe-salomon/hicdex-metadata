I am too discouraged and desperate to handle things.\nAt the same time, I also have many things I want to do which I never thought I could do. I\nlove drawing and will always keep drawing until I get old. I want to grow up strong and try my\nbest in everyday life.\nPastel Sky work communicates about conflicts that arise in myself. Even if I am sad or fail at\nsomething, I still have a bright sky with me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNVTpnzUb4aHns2YfmF5jNvbjSBQc1kHzBGq6aYoMU3PJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcVtkHgCJ9Hnj1e7k649oUnWkBGc8tqxx9L5UULsfHoc7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNVTpnzUb4aHns2YfmF5jNvbjSBQc1kHzBGq6aYoMU3PJ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TXzW17SYR956HRaVuLq54ioQ4VNbrm7Zo"], "tags": ["anime", "girl", "animegirl", "sky", "pastel", "blue", "dream", "angelofdeath", "Halo", "Japanese"], "extra": {}}
