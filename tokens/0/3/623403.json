The cryptic amount is either 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, or 500, so six related trading cards make up a set. The Cryptic Sphere is a 3D graphic experiment by The Vectorizer. It is a play of changing shapes, lights, colors and surfaces. Each Cryptic Sphere is created individually by hand with great effort. There are recurring elements but no automated generation processes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSZe628ajWM2efT3D8dw78Scz2xbZNGYRHrT3d8HFcaHx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT4KygwoyK9BXi5zaFXxLUdJfPiQbryHrHYFqxH4VMmc5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWXB9AWy1n5Yi8zdq3izjAt4Z3JAsvwmeQ6AtFjn4iu6N", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSZe628ajWM2efT3D8dw78Scz2xbZNGYRHrT3d8HFcaHx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fdgiHWujDz1bbmRQKHTPdYpBwMdstu5hB"], "tags": [], "extra": {}}
