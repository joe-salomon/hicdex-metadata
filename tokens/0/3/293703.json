{"__version": 1, "token_id": 293703, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "", "description": "Native to Central America to the northern regions of South America, this tropical rainforest dweller is a small-sized member of the Tucano family. It features a black face surrounding a contrasting bright-red skin around the yellow eyes. It receives its collared name from the reddish color around the back of its neck. When reaching their adult age, their colors tend to get brighter to indicate sexual maturity.\n\nAs an inhabitant of the tropical rainforests, this colorful dweller's diet is composed of arboreal fruits, insects, eggs, lizards, and small prey. Differing from other toucan species, they socialize to nest in the same hole accommodating up to six adults and some younglings, with their graphite-black tails folded over their backs.\n\nIUCN Red List of Threatened Species status: https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22726200/94914704", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidbgc7otekxg6nw6fagq3m4m7zzr4pqxsrfvnfdpziaviidiamf4q", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifshbmvzgoli2az6fckvqhjs3a5d7xiisb3fdjwjkwvzoss3g42s4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidbgc7otekxg6nw6fagq3m4m7zzr4pqxsrfvnfdpziaviidiamf4q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QrygyS7ATny4HZ6po93nxWCH16q55bbvV"], "tags": ["biodiversity", "wildlife", "latinamerica", "digitalphotography", "wildlifephotography", "colombia", "bird"], "extra": {}}
