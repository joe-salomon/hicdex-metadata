The seeds can lay dormant for years on end, waiting for a special confluence of events forming the right conditions for their emergence \u2013 a year or so after bushfire followed by rainfall. These special flowers covered our land a year after the Black Summer. They provide a ray of hope and their Flower Essence helps with healing the emotional trauma from experiencing wild fire.\n\nPhoto taken early 2021 ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmURsW8gYa7qqQc5CqHDtfUFCFHQW4UagCxmBE15pXCJSN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWVm4RU24Az8XF6HXTLrEGt8wBysAUvivkPdjP6oDmaDF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmURsW8gYa7qqQc5CqHDtfUFCFHQW4UagCxmBE15pXCJSN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ePmqcpv4QakmRAiiBedgq1GNq6Sch1Bcq"], "tags": ["flowers", "nature", "rosejackson", "photography"], "extra": {}}
