This generative artwork was released as a set of single-edition [1/1] iteration mints (numbered: 1-4) on Hic Et Nunc by Kenny Vaden. A smooth omnidirectional flowfield was used to produce 50-60 squares with ex-Guassian distributed sizes that were drawn in outline, shifted in size-scaled random directions off-center. The squares were drawn as thin outlines, followed by random numbers of edge points that were transformed based on the flowfield over a series of time steps. Each segment that was produced by the flowfield was drawn as a square, rectangle, tangential rectangle, or narrow rectangle based on a random draw. Colors were based on the square number. Line thickness was randomly varied for all of the shapes. A small proportion of flowlines were smoothed using spline interpolation and plotted in dark gray or colored lines. The image dimensions for this file are 20x20 inches and resolution is 300 DPI, which produced a file size below the limit, which provides a higher resolution (more detail) than the original version shown online.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPcNb5BG1JbBdcHqbtURBiwuKxkfdP87r4SwQS8QTr1EV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcDzHHkynWTpmdTvgGEfPArL22AKNEbaXrRCzCqVxuEfs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPcNb5BG1JbBdcHqbtURBiwuKxkfdP87r4SwQS8QTr1EV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bEHdSDNdTTPmuin84c6LWqruepu6a5sc5"], "tags": ["Flowfields", "GenerativeArt", "RCode"], "extra": {}}
