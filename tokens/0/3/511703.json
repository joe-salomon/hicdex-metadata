The original painting was made with acrylic paint for the abstract background and all the black lines were done with an acrylic ink. This is a 1/1, which means only one of these will be minted to the blockchain. There are 3 different color versions available, but only 1 of each, so they are totally unique originals. I hope you enjoy it!
