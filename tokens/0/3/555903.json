However, the idea that the dire wolf should be transferred to the genus Aenocyon has surfaced in 2020, based on genetic factors, and published in 2021. The genome of the dire wolf shows that it belonged to a different lineage of canids, diverging earlier. This evidence supports the theory that the dire wolf should be transferred from the genus Canis and into a more suiting genus; Aenocyon.\n\nFive genomes were analyzed between 13,000 and 50,000 years ago. They were likely morphologically similar to the 5.7 million-year split, and it is highly unlikely no gene flow was present between Aenocyon and North American grey wolves or coyotes, with the dire wolf evolving in isolation from these species. Despite other North American canids evolving from Eurasia and colonizing recently, Aenocyon representing New World origins.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVojkbCxuCU82eoV5zd6iYkJ5bMCisoniKDMjgBQZQAvy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVojkbCxuCU82eoV5zd6iYkJ5bMCisoniKDMjgBQZQAvy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVojkbCxuCU82eoV5zd6iYkJ5bMCisoniKDMjgBQZQAvy", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1N4g4qAJcGCVQeJLDzQiDiGB2R7A54BGEG"], "tags": ["Direwolf", "werewolves", "wolf", "darknft", "nftgif"], "extra": {}}
