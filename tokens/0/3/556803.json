I was a little lost but pushed by the flow towards it. In front of it the crowd began to pull ropes and open the box. Inside there was a gigantic ogre full of colors and smallpox starving and licking his lips; the crowd began to move away as I stood alone in front of the ogre, the size of his shoes, and then the hunt began... The massive crowd who lined up as 2 magnetic blocs, lurking, clucking and screaming, was even more frightful than the 3 headed ogre... and we never run as fast as we want in dreams.\n\n\nThis is the last of 3 on this nightmare.\n\nAquatint etching", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU8qhtvYEoKRsFgxFDVERHZLYmZHYu3w2LUvtLRXuUbLK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUfw8AxGHrTzknFTaWYmt8Ka7XpsFzvq1ga7TjAnGFaBd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU8qhtvYEoKRsFgxFDVERHZLYmZHYu3w2LUvtLRXuUbLK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RTyG19vPkLKBghpvn14gzkJNfqDuNiBFu"], "tags": ["grotesque", "demophobic", "aquatint", "nightmare", "childhood", "etching", "recurringdreams", "jeansaucisse"], "extra": {}}
