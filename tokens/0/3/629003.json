{"__version": 1, "token_id": 629003, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ULTRA RARE FIND ULTRAREFINED", "description": "What do we value in life? Money? Status? Power? For me, it's knowledge or at least perceived knowledge. It's all about finding that ultra rare find, similar to the feeling of going to an old record store and sorting through the records; on the hunt for the one record you know has some rare sound or melody you've never heard before. It's being the arbiter, the filter to perception; being the one who sifts through language looking for gold, gems, and glory. When we let go of materialism, we gain a new sense; awareness. An awareness or sensitivity to focus on (seemingly) more important aspects of life. When I let go of trying to be someone I was not, I discovered the ultrarefined version of myself; I was the gold, the gem, and the glory that I was looking for. It's hard to let go of the destructive vice-like grip that American Capitalism has on us. Once you're in it, the darkness becomes a part of you. So, looking deeper within we discover all the old records, all the memories, all the desires and dreams, and all the catalysts of change. Be the change that you seek.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbUDmJiow74H7t9FjidisG1M999phDeLQXLU1wqumUdgh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQrZQBpGDxR4yvD2pvYZsBATkGxaiYenkG6y3VssHBaAw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbUDmJiow74H7t9FjidisG1M999phDeLQXLU1wqumUdgh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
