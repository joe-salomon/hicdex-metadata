Using archival images and text copied directly from captions, the pieces highlights how the Filipinos were portrayed as uncivilized and underdeveloped savages and how it contributed to perpetuating a condescending view of their culture. \n\nThe title comes from the caption in one of the images: \n\"Every day in the week is receiving day with these good natured savages.\" \n\nActual caption on image:\n\"The most ambitious and advanced of the Igorot community are not above fascinations of the dance, nor can they resist the life long habit to appear without clothing. Antaero is far in advance of his people in his efforts to go the white man\u2019s road. He not only speaks english but sings English songs. When the President of the United States asked him how it was that he spoke such good English he said it was because he went to the Filipino school at the World\u2019s Fair every day. His ambition is to teach school when he becoes a man, but when asked if he would wear American clothes, he replied, \u201cI like string breech.\u201d This is the name Igorot apply to the clout.
