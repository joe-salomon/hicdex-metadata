These lumbering creatures have eyes on their knees in order to better see the humans they prey upon, using their various pseudopods to pick up humans and other living things in order to devour them and metabolize their skin into nutrients. \n\nFlesh Golems, while massive, can be destroyed through terrestrial means. They have an incredibly large bulk of flesh, and since they control most aspects of their body, they won\u2019t stop until all of the flesh has either been destroyed, or removed from the nucleus deep within their body. The massive amount of damage needing to be inflicted upon this creature to stop it thus classifies it as a Nightmare-level demon.
