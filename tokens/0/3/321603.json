{"__version": 1, "token_id": 321603, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Manx Cat", "description": "The Manx cat closely resembles the British Shorthair in type with the obvious exception of the tail. The body is compact and solid, with a broad chest and short back. The rump is rounded and should be higher than the shoulders. The legs are short and powerful, with the back legs being slightly longer than the front. In the show cat there must be absolutely no tail and the rump should be completely rounded but stumps of varying lengths are allowed in the breeding or pet cat. The Manx cat's coat has a double quality with a short thick undercoat and a slightly longer overcoat. Any combination of colour and markings is seen with the exception of the Siamese cat breed's pattern.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUb38eWgzRquPJMc3N8hVeYKdnzjhYYyAHfq7ak2LE3u7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUb38eWgzRquPJMc3N8hVeYKdnzjhYYyAHfq7ak2LE3u7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUb38eWgzRquPJMc3N8hVeYKdnzjhYYyAHfq7ak2LE3u7", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["pixelart", "cat", "pet", "animal", "objkt4objkt", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
