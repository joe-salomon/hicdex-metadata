Maybe we didn't think about how much without a mask until there was a corona.\nAnd it is pleasant to breathe carefree. We may have forgotten how much air and oxygen there were.\nIt's delicious! We may not know how much to be in a group that some\nWe complained and did not want to be present in them, we need it. We do not know how much\nTouching the hands of our loved ones and even a stranger with whom we shake hands for the first time,\nWe have become dependent. Maybe we forgot how much sitting next to friends and family\nIt calmed us down. Maybe we didn't even think about how much we thought and acted.\nThe health of the whole society is affected. We may not know that the day will come when the life of our compatriot will be in our hands and we will be able to protect the lives of our loved ones with a mask and observe social distances.
