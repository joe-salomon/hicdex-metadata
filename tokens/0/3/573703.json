You give strength to our team to continue our romantic and artistic life, I hope we spread love all over the world.\nAll material and intellectual rights of this work officially belong to me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeHY7maTbN7CFidP8HDaPC6ejiRrsXTn9EhWqS9dGXh3H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcBW4fuPQ256FZffhpNUvBMK8oNrXbmYCMUeXRL3L59pB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeHY7maTbN7CFidP8HDaPC6ejiRrsXTn9EhWqS9dGXh3H", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1TKMgSDoVT46jp2g5V8Yru2QNeGwE65cFr"], "tags": ["Illustration", "art", "face", "red", "eye", "beauty", "beautiful", "pretty", "love", "trpo", "calligraphy", "persian", "persiancallygraphy", "lovelyface", ""], "extra": {}}
