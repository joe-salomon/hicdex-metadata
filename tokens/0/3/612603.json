From meeting wonderful collectors to being consumed into collecting,\nI found myself with almost 200 NFTs in my personal collection as the year ended.\n\nI have been awakened yet again into another year this time better, stronger, with a Legion of Hunters & an amazing community.\n\nSending a gift to all my OG collectors who believed, supported, and loved my work always. \n\nWishing you all\nA Very Happy New Year. 2022 ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZdN32MrMostTG6aWg9UxUXXM3ooZSAyfzxe6zgxJdRuJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcv85XFzr128Hi7T51gFCFGGNAM3QQPzgbu2X2mrjjo2c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZdN32MrMostTG6aWg9UxUXXM3ooZSAyfzxe6zgxJdRuJ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1axwR2BopdZzaR9bPH9E5Zvx5PtGH99BhC"], "tags": ["dark", "alone", "room", "window", "city", "glitch", "noise", "horror", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
