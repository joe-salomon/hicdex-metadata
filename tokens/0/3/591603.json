I spent time with Erica, a local optometry student having fun with modeling here and there, and we created some cool images. She wanted to incorporate the little dandelions into a couple shots. My goal with this piece was to take the focus on the dandelion theme was to make the entire piece of artwork look and feel like a pretty little weed. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb6ir5EfVJe2kyY4NbS2UYjGUd67bB5fRfHNVp2soseBg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXPhHDsykcgcRq5XkTtW3QB5bKfyDziGreeNqmS4SHP9E", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb6ir5EfVJe2kyY4NbS2UYjGUd67bB5fRfHNVp2soseBg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["art", "photoart", "photography", "flower", "weed", "digitalpainting"], "extra": {}}
