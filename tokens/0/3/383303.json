Moods are audio and visual tidbits from my inner vision, creative re/interpretations of the world around and within. Mood339 is the first Mood minted in this series, and given a random number between 1 and 999. Hodlers of my Mood NFTs will become members of my new blockchain community, with the potential for certain advantages to be bestowed upon them at times tbd. This is a creative, learning and social experiment! The goal is to expand my creative scope and my support network as a musician and artist. Where will the moods take us?\n\nIf you hold this mood, make yourself known on twitter: @georgelepauw", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma7CXSNMNad1DStxa1Zj78P9YnvXTM7mCysHiFGAMGNc3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaZiryEk4bdxxW11bLe8dQiBgJu4cgLpa2jMdv7T3Mkiw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma7CXSNMNad1DStxa1Zj78P9YnvXTM7mCysHiFGAMGNc3", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1ZZKnEKTUaFxVJ8QYNBG4W5TVpJSbjqsMR"], "tags": ["mood", "audionft", "musicnft", "art", "music", "composition", "georgelepauw", "lepauw"], "extra": {}}
