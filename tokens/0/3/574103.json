That's how bad this book year was. Ever hear a word or a sound and think that sounds so odd, but it works? Am I the only one that thinks this? I happened to hear a track from a band called Mind Gamers, entitled \"Come to America\". There's a line that goes, \"suspicious vicious blonde\" and it just sounds so ridiculous that my partner and I were joking about it and he began to say \"Suspicious vicious splishy splash.\" It was a fun moment that I wanted to cement into an artwork so that I will never forget it. Whether or not it's good \"art\" doesn't really matter. I could careless if someone hates it, it means a lot to me and that's why it's in this book. Oh and...buhhhhhh bye 2020. You were the absolute worst.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZb54kRmhFsoyRGpqViiFCRKaPB6bVFAVrXtqZURjt2hm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWXoomPmAJosTyjBTkzaq5LJngtkPo452N6SsjZJq3KVd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZb54kRmhFsoyRGpqViiFCRKaPB6bVFAVrXtqZURjt2hm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
