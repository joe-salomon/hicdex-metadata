{"__version": 1, "token_id": 400003, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "IN CHALLAH WE TRUST / INCH'ALLAH WE TRUST", "description": "I love a good entendre, especially when it's a double or triple entendre. In this case, American currency have the words that most of us have seen at one point or another, \"In God We Trust\". Playing on the theme of the illusive abstract of money as a unit of measurement (just like inches, grams, etc.) and religion, we arrive at the 2 cross roads (see what I did there?) of mental abstraction and utter ridiculousness in human behavior. We can take the saying In God We Trust, and use a bizarre coincidence where the words In Challah (Challah, a special braided bread made by Eastern European Jews eaten on special holidays and Shabbat evenings.) & Inch'Allah (Arabic word for \"God willing\" or \"if God wills it\") replace the words \"In God\". The result is wordplay crossing over into 2 separate, yet equally abstractions of human existence. Both equally dangerous without proper systems in place to prevent abuses of power, which leads to a higher question, \"Who are the arbiters of trust and truth?\" Do you trust money? Do you trust \"god\"? Do you trust your fellow human? Do you even trust yourself?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQYxLP8F7YyvAxHCJs733d2s7xTP4EYXLWEabcU7yXSAp", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma4zC7nbJRKkTTk6oiKiKbea6cuHk8FSJ6UTc58Mpz5MH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQYxLP8F7YyvAxHCJs733d2s7xTP4EYXLWEabcU7yXSAp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
