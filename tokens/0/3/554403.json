Legend has it that a young girl had the bridge built because her sister lived on the other side of the canal - so they could see each other more often.\n\nCouples who kiss on Magere Brug stay together forever - at least that's what the legend says. We can't find a better place to kiss and it's definitely worth a try.\n\nThe white baby swan feather, floating fragile and untouched before an inevitable wave on the most busy spot of Amsterdam will engulf it, to me stands for innocence and a first step into the future which lies ahead, whatever it may bring.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZR3iqmgg2yDXHJuEUFMye26Zitne89j6JXpDnYBPpqCL", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf2c3bwey2oanQXUgShjvnBYrcsVNtfCgoCCsD5RR2WcY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZR3iqmgg2yDXHJuEUFMye26Zitne89j6JXpDnYBPpqCL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1h3ca9zaSo62fECYDbDHmhejkQYVxArv5r"], "tags": ["amsterdam", "canal", "skinnybridge", "youth", "feather", "legend", "swan", "innocence", "future", "magerebrug", "floating"], "extra": {}}
