It was my last day in town, i decided to take a walk around the lake. As i was walking to get back to the festival venue, the brokeass-cheapskate me took a 'shortcut' by entering the Lausanne M\u00e9tro with no tickets. I was filming the front view of the train with my blackmagic pocket cinema camera when those muscular polices caught me without any tickets. I got fined 150 CHF for not paying around 3-4 CHF lol. I learned the lesson the hard way.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSEPcnYn2DoFL15F7uVSx1jzCHZnkDtx4VYrzG6m2moY5", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme4iGkYUxGQ4iGSjns33LASr63kzqSpqFYSiehArApSma", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSEPcnYn2DoFL15F7uVSx1jzCHZnkDtx4VYrzG6m2moY5", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gErsfuf2JHL4EBR4jb7myo6JMytN6WKAb"], "tags": ["breakcore", "LausanneM\u00e9tro", "lausanne", "train", "cinematography"], "extra": {}}
