I really enjoy playing with these. It's exciting to see how the color just defines it's own parameters. It's like trying to control the flow of water down a mountain from a bucker. You can release the water, but the water will go where it wants. The only thing we can control is where the water starts. I always imagine this type of artwork like that process. It's a physical and mental exercise in letting go of control to achieve, ironically, a controlled entropy. I definitely will do more of these later on. So many ideas to get out.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPmob8nqyGhVba5ixL1KiE7y6fNWbmVdQFHjrtcsXA3AH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWJY5ZSvWS61gmXJRdufFnPJHiBxvjpHERriKAJvdkorY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPmob8nqyGhVba5ixL1KiE7y6fNWbmVdQFHjrtcsXA3AH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
