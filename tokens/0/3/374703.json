It seems to me alone that this is disrespect for smokers?) In my new series of works, I fantasized about how the packs of cigarettes would look if I worked out art for them. I hope you find something interesting for yourself :D ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXtARvDLx1rHvgNSrAbp8CnRqDDChPShtMznK1i5AmmzM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWY7UCKTq1pxq1VdqqFgwK2ow4gGEYLg6d1x9j84ctfQG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXtARvDLx1rHvgNSrAbp8CnRqDDChPShtMznK1i5AmmzM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1c2FCVECYwmvvZrXR7RHjchHmZAyn1D5Kh"], "tags": ["Illustration", "digital", "art", "hand-drawn", "111"], "extra": {}}
