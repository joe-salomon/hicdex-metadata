He is The One who\u2019s mercy will endow whoever he willed among His creatures. Whatever Allah decrees is done with perfect judgement and He is never harsh or unjust in his rulings.\n\nAllah has already forgiven the Prophet and the Muhajireen and the Ansar who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a party of them had almost inclined [to doubt], and then He forgave them. Indeed, He was to them Kind and Merciful. (Quran 9:117)\n\nIt is He who sends down upon His Servant [Muhammad] verses of clear evidence that He may bring you out from darkness\u2019s into the light. And indeed, Allah is to you Kind and Merciful. (Quran 57:9)\n\nAnd [there is a share for] those who came after them, saying, \u201cOur Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.\u201d (Quran 59:10)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXcRpAkQnSgjCLnKWMyAm7ghLGgNLUiVHgf3oGT15okJy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQvwhZGH11xjYkkFbkDCVHk3bfGBzuR2SJc1aZFkAA6zn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXcRpAkQnSgjCLnKWMyAm7ghLGgNLUiVHgf3oGT15okJy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["moslem", "religion", "colorful", "1of1", "asmaulhusna", "god", "asmaulhusnanft", "name", "allah", "islam"], "extra": {}}
