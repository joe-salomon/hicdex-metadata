{"__version": 1, "token_id": 465503, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Glaze", "description": "This simulation incorporates an exclusion process - if something tries to enter a cell that is already above a certain threshold density, then it's velocity is set to zero instead. The result is something that behaves as a liquid at low densities and speeds, but jams into a solid around a particular threshold. Here, combined with weak gravity, that results in islands of frozen material and a sort of cracked glaze texture. / @ngutten\n\n2560 x 1440 mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXnqUHH7E9PQJPa8su2KVX8FzLm3djuncFbBWRLf7Lf4P", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdS5P5JEibWfqLkP3QWXhB69vsENn688qtKmPs5idFFq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXnqUHH7E9PQJPa8su2KVX8FzLm3djuncFbBWRLf7Lf4P", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["glaze", "video", "simulation", "generative", "neural", "advection", "cellularautomaton"], "extra": {}}
