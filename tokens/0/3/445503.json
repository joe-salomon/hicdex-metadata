Based off of the South Korean TV series.\n\nEach day, players are eliminated at random until one remains! The winner will have their address displayed for all to see.\n\nTo enter, simply collect the objkt from my address. Buying on the secondary market will not enter you into the game.\n\n** Disclaimer:\n\nThis is a beta test. The game may break, and depends upon the HicDex api to work. If the api changes, this will likely not work.\n\nThe randomizer is seeded by the total number of objkts minted on the days after the contest begins and is not determined beforehand, meaning I have absolutely no control over who wins.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfFy7cLjSQxxqdXynYfeYWFRpDvqToBuuQho1mvQJG3ty", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYtoituZfV2KD6eL311gpspvBwjbtzhxYZ83oEt7zbF1P", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfFy7cLjSQxxqdXynYfeYWFRpDvqToBuuQho1mvQJG3ty", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1UT9xFATwBZN9qwMa4YsoRWGKpVpnPMoui"], "tags": ["squidgame1", "interactive", "game", "javascript", "html", "css", "squidgame"], "extra": {}}
