Can you believe it?!\n\nDriving Ferrari's car F2004, he was the ultimate champion on that year... 13 races as the winner!\n\nUnfortunately Michael had an accident in December 2013 while skiing at French Alps Resort of Maribel. He hit his head on a rock while skiing with his son Mick (who became a F1 driver in 2021), and stayed in coma for almost a year. \n\nHe's receiving treatment within today and very little is known about his condition.\n\nWe hope you can get better, live a peaceful and glorious life, and be fine, champion!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW5eyafF1QSVDJRKs57EtV5U4x9rCzGepqQn5wQmbLHL1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWLRqnvgqotneo9g6E5wkerCrvhLJyhaCQyynwtF3QKRz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW5eyafF1QSVDJRKs57EtV5U4x9rCzGepqQn5wQmbLHL1", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VCxT6pT12ZDYS7iVUzVLtiRCw6BbVCM5g"], "tags": ["michaelschumacher", "schumacher", "f1", "formula1", "ferrari", "car", "driver", "drive", "race", "racer", "gp", "grandprix"], "extra": {}}
