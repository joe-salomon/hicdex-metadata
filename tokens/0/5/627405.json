The philosopher Plato concluded that they must be the fundamental building blocks, \"the atoms\" of nature.\n\nPlato assigned to the solids what he believed to be the essential elements of the universe.\nHe assigned fire to the tetrahedron, earth to the cube, air to the octahedron, and water to the icosahedron. The dodecahedron represents the constellations that make up the universe.\n\nThe polyblock series: \"Perfect shapes seem to be carved out of graphite, coal or glass, and crossed by arrays of rare metals, networks of silver and gold, only revealed by reflections of light.\"\nThere are as many editions of a polyblock as its amount of faces.\n\nThis NFT was originally released on NiftyGateway (https://niftygateway.com/collections/joanielemercier), a platform now dismissed, and this replacement NFT provides better provenance, ownership, conservation and higher resolution.\n\nhttps://joanielemercier.com/null-and-void/", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZgxyWAiLNANXVLob8sHhre4JXaUfwKsizcX8KGyqx3qw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVFCjMAJZpPkRrq1hmDRf6YAvbZSkRyfM4VKPTFCFmfMh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZgxyWAiLNANXVLob8sHhre4JXaUfwKsizcX8KGyqx3qw", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1P5Za1TUMsDejgzMM5iMNfHAxDUpPCHiwZ"], "tags": ["Octahedron", "polyblock", "platonic", "solid", "nullandvoid"], "extra": {}}
