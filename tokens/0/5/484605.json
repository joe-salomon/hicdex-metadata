It is chemically similar to both stimulants and hallucinogens, producing feelings of increased energy, pleasure, emotional warmth, and distorted sensory and time perception. MDMA was initially popular in the nightclub scene and at all-night dance parties (\u201craves\u201d), but the drug now affects a broader range of people who more commonly call the drug Ecstasy or Molly.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmarRzyZoiBDKj2MetChdVnFAceuuaq5CwLPsjkHvnZ2qw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmarRzyZoiBDKj2MetChdVnFAceuuaq5CwLPsjkHvnZ2qw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmarRzyZoiBDKj2MetChdVnFAceuuaq5CwLPsjkHvnZ2qw"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "nft", "drugs", "ecstasy"], "extra": {}}
