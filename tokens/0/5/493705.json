Only in these cases we should call it reverse Halloween: it's monsters disguised as people.\nThey will tap on your door three times. They will charm you with their plastic heart and without you noticing they will get you out of your house, keeping your keys. They will put some melted candy in your hands and then put a price on it. No refunds are accepted, now you owe them everything. If you reveal yourself to them they will show off by displaying their violence, as if it were a beautiful art they cultivate with the lights off. Then they will confuse you with their neat victim disguise.\nYou will not be able to fight them. They have no peace, only an insatiable emptiness.\nIf you don't run, they will crush your head with their delusional superiority.\nYour pain will make their mouths water.\n\nHave you met such nauseating people?\nNarcissism is not a horror tale, you'd better inform yourself about it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNfTLYXcYTKLGrNzhF2kRg781DTN7bGaxCyxyMUEZV9UU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXQVsjJRQPNyyiNBrvvw6jPLJhv3t9L61qCgCh3aFUi9z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNfTLYXcYTKLGrNzhF2kRg781DTN7bGaxCyxyMUEZV9UU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LkZeTk6UoisEM1VvE7qWewjcE25hP9qNk"], "tags": ["nftart", "nftartist", "tezosart", "nftcommmunity", "henlloween", "tezos", "nftcollectors", "henhalloween"], "extra": {}}
