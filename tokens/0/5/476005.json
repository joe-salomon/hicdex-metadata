Built in 1921 by eccentric artists Eleanor and George Bridges, the home was a gathering place for influential artists such as Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway. Edgar Cayce is reported to have been inducted into the Theosophical Society at this property. When I visited the property with the current owner I was allowed to observe the energy and see if I felt the presence of spirits. This property feels like there\u2019s always an orchestra, a party that will never ever end. \n\nThis small door separates two adorable sitting areas outside the house. There are so many little passageways and details in this home, and this door felt like it could be used as a portal to another time, maybe back to the spirited days of the 1920s. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSoZuVq8QZRrpPhWeKkNKKBnFBSBRnDQr3jtKbiLtWB62", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSh6c6AotaDN769gvnocfaYewAaHAdyFFofD9fXE4cCHc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSoZuVq8QZRrpPhWeKkNKKBnFBSBRnDQr3jtKbiLtWB62", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hZ4xUe27QGrigjR7Qk1YYZ2mrWpkaHYDQ"], "tags": ["Pink", "historical", "doorway", "iPhone", ""], "extra": {}}
