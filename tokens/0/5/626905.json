He used \u201cHowler\u201d to flirt with me. That was crazy, because \u201cHowler\u201d was such a bad omen to me. Its high-pitched voice spoke sweet words.\n\nIt's not compatible at all.\nBut you know, what's crazier?\nIt's how I like his flirting trick.\n\nI heard he consulted his friends on how to behave. To be with a daredevil like me. He didn't even realize that his friends were always telling weird ways. and sometimes teasing him.\n\nBut I want him to know....that he doesn't need to change himself. Just being a bit clumsy yourself, always smiling and giving warm hugs. That's enough for me to fall in love.\n\nAlright!\nWhat I want to say is today is a special day Because we decided to get together after learning each other for a long time. More than half of the people in the school said we were too different. But I don't care! 'Cause I know the difference will fill.\n\nAnd know that I will live happily ever after with the man I love the most. even if it makes them shudder.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ5V76qxV1YSU2dMayxccGa4V2ozybK9ShLpwFgEYsmJK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVokqJ8YAqPmchRaW2ZkZpFheWfWZNk9AF6oLb6q9icK5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ5V76qxV1YSU2dMayxccGa4V2ozybK9ShLpwFgEYsmJK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2H6fY4k8mjNaJrXdncH23SdXZLMBVQ8siz"], "tags": ["Illustration", "nftfiction", "yaoi", "magic", "Hogwarts", "LGBTQ", "novel"], "extra": {}}
