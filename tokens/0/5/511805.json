But she couldn\u2019t, because this someone was her ex-boyfriend of two years already, and she knew she had to keep her distance.\n\nOn that night, she decided to download an online dating app, to look for someone to talk to, in order to distract herself from her loneliness.\n\n\u201cI was distracted in the moment while using the app that night, but I realised from using it more, that it\u2019s frustrating that getting a response doesn\u2019t happen immediately, so it\u2019s not a very good way to talk to someone quickly.\u201d\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPFBmM99WY3q6hn2jTmzJ9WvhJ2xW5xfn4LgVqQmtukwX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPFBmM99WY3q6hn2jTmzJ9WvhJ2xW5xfn4LgVqQmtukwX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPFBmM99WY3q6hn2jTmzJ9WvhJ2xW5xfn4LgVqQmtukwX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2BmgosYQvrJhXmPqLFy44RjygiwdjyjTyj"], "tags": ["portrait", "photojournalism", "mentalhealth", "expressionism", "digitalart", "love", "copingmechanism"], "extra": {}}
