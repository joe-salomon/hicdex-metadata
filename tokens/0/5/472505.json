A ginguette, musicians who play guitar and accordion, something to eat, and above all something to drink: wine and beer. In this atmosphere nobody tries to show themselves, they are, and that's perfect. At the turn of a game of \"p\u00e9tanque\", there was this woman who seemed to come out of a novel from the end of the 19th century. This shot is my favorite of this evening.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbhQGZ52HNEvLGgPWr1B7e7Y2YfPC5yceSdweYtvPFCP2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR2VcABpUaPVMtHTDRYW5ezbvSDkMXi519T3Bkr5Y32P2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbhQGZ52HNEvLGgPWr1B7e7Y2YfPC5yceSdweYtvPFCP2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bdQSVe6rYXDRnd7QDvhV5wfp1sUQJ8QBX"], "tags": ["photography", "B&W", "Art", "France", ""], "extra": {}}
