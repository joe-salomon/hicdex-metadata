Laziness plays a small part on the reason why. After spending much of our time in a room working on our newest \u2018Casement EP\u2019(released on our Bandcamp page), inhaling some fresh air outside actually feels that refreshing. \n\nIn the middle of snapping some pictures for our own stock images around that park, we witness a komorebi \u2014 a ray of light filtered by the tree. Well, it looks so beautiful, we decided to capture it with our phone as it reminded us to this sketch we had. \n\nAfterwards, as we remembered how nice of an experience we have had on that park, we decided to name this release as \u2018Komorebi[\u6728\u6f0f\u308c\u65e5]\u2019. We hope this can also be your strolling-around-the-park-while-sunbathing soundtrack.
