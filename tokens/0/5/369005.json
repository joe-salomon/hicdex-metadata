In Still Life with Fruit Dish he created a shallow, compressed space that flattens the sculptural volumes of dish, glass, and fruit. This painting was a prized possession of the artist Paul Gauguin, who described the picture as \"an exceptional pearl, the apple of my eye.\" It was only when he needed money for medical care that Gauguin unhappily parted with it.\n\nCollated via Google Image Search. Due to varying degrees of compression artifacts each search result displays a unique version of the original with little continuity between results.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfKhnU438E9bMRmy9EtbpDWwTNor4E54yVX6YMDK82EhP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaGm2Zf5gvrzTo1Z8pgURVLYhCTGwR5G5TmpG3FCQ4K74", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfKhnU438E9bMRmy9EtbpDWwTNor4E54yVX6YMDK82EhP", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1f9TBznxnaPVmh6V7JRXQYK3qkPQfFn5wV"], "tags": ["remastered", "cezanne"], "extra": {}}
