After he died, i discovered he was a photographer, apart from his work as a radioman and a sailor. He was travelling the world while USSR remained under the Iron Curtain. Nobody was able to leave the USSR and see what is happening with the rest of the world. But he did have ability as he was on the ship. My collaboration is a story about the history of Russia from 1970\u2019s till today. Are we still chained to the past? Are we able to sail to the waters of future ever? What are we searching for? What does it mean to be Russian in modern world? I share just a feeling, not pretending to have the answers. The diaries of a sailor is a series about eternal, never ending search of home that doesn\u2019t exist", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQHqnJUAHZ2jG2EKNrgHRVwdrpPVndUWEt2H4VeBHtggk", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme54Gbpf7JMjrNSJBanNsT7A3t95RY68Xi3kYh9WPy1jh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQHqnJUAHZ2jG2EKNrgHRVwdrpPVndUWEt2H4VeBHtggk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L8RSMjxuEupFEscUk1UYJ9iFktojwvJTJ"], "tags": ["photography", "russianart", "nikitapirogov", "lighthouse", "hope", "sailor", "radionman", "ussr", "grandfathergrandson"], "extra": {}}
