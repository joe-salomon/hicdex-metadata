Chef Anthony Bourdain", "description": "My homage to the best chef.\nTo cook is to create, is to live, to breathe, to love, to laugh, to be. Cooks beat to the tempo of a drum that most people never will understand, and some fellow cooks for that matter will never understand. To cook free is to find appreciation with what you're cooking. To be able to harbor a so called \"endangered species\" from an \"unknown source\" and cook the hell out it into something amazing. It's to take a shark filet and make a tartare, it's to be able to deep fry something in whale fat, it's to put foie grais on a club sandwich, it's to make a dish out of sweetbreads.\nRest in Peace Boss!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbADYjb7oTtsi24bJdWbthJDFvAQy8EU71aWopiZx2uiE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbADYjb7oTtsi24bJdWbthJDFvAQy8EU71aWopiZx2uiE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbADYjb7oTtsi24bJdWbthJDFvAQy8EU71aWopiZx2uiE", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1LzzvGAAeAzMKmpc1P2abTkRQxwP8suon4"], "tags": ["pixelart", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
