When we go to a carnival, festival, fair, whatever, she insists on having her face painted if it is available. This was special. It even had jewel-like stickers integrated into her face artwork. The original photo was rather simple, but it seemed to need something that emphasizes how fantastic the face paint really was. It was almost cosmic, hence the flares and purple tones. This was very much inspired by \u2018Doctor Strange\u2019. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR8YBxYXWY9NgbbaVa9wWFGXTnhdbaWiTmNLoUhV2iL3f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSxkbF5EkXfenLkRfd6vzafNyPjvwy6EmULxGZD9DBMBp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR8YBxYXWY9NgbbaVa9wWFGXTnhdbaWiTmNLoUhV2iL3f", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["facepaint", "photography", "portrait", "cosmic", "strange", "digital"], "extra": {}}
