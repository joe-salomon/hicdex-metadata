Embracing the roots of Brazil, she brings a powerful geometric work that inspired us to create a piece celebrating all women who enhance culture and diversity in art. \n\n\"Tinta \u00e9 poder\" means Paint is Power. When we have the art materials to express ourselves, we can share experiences and value our identities, reaching people. Expression is Power, express yourself.\n\nIllustration by \n@_isabelarts\n\n\nColors, motion & music by \n@numadessas", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNamQc3WQ5wGb7YuhhcwkRXxZAyANeSmhR8hYFmWp9cK2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdFgnPqtDTfLMM6dP1shDa3VreeEYTXvMuZapTJf7kfDa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNamQc3WQ5wGb7YuhhcwkRXxZAyANeSmhR8hYFmWp9cK2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fLdyJqakB3v9CQN8mLCFRxNfFThmYHGmo"], "tags": ["woman", "power", "powerful", "colorful", "purple", "red", "green", "yellow", "brasil", "brazil", "graffiti", "writer", "performer", "paint", "paiting", "spray", "beats", "beatmaker", "girlbeatmaker"], "extra": {}}
