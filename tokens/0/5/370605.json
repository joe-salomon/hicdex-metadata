Everyone uses it in their own way. And it\u2019s also used in different ways. Someone just wanna looks cool and buys different types of bongs. Someone smokes through a pipe like Pablo Escobar, but I think if Bob Marley lived in Russia, he would be smoking pot through a leaky plastic bottle, because there\u2019s nothing more aesthetic like a homemade appliance and a dirt access.
