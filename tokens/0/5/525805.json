In the early 2000s warnet used to be one of favorite places just to hang out. When internet wasn't as common as it now, some people come just to know how the internet looks, how does it work, is it a real thing? or just looking for a place with loved ones. So I called it the dark age and i kinda miss those times.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeQgA4Ve6T4Tq4N1sh1XewNHSeNaoFqTUDTXeecYPhJFe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcUghnwYkWFsiWD3QQNmhKCjPbb1EjvB2gLGi61QtJZEi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeQgA4Ve6T4Tq4N1sh1XewNHSeNaoFqTUDTXeecYPhJFe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2NkYyrKEXifZnvZ8xrYQM1TvXe3Ho1d4zW"], "tags": ["internet", "warnet", "illustration", "cafe", "people", "tech", "vintage"], "extra": {}}
