{"__version": 1, "token_id": 406305, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Cyborg Shia", "description": "Preface: A quiet peace settled on Metallon. Meanwhile there were rumours that a starship believed to be one from the fleet of the old guardians was sighted near the twin moons of nearby Pacedonia. It became clear that the starship is one of the old guardians' accompanying frigate that was reported missing during the final Shakintara assault. On board were the infamous Phantagenians, a race of cyborgs came to rejoin the alliance.\n\nProfile: Shia is super-humanly strong, resistant to damage, can leap large distances, and can breathe underwater. Her most prominent ability is the power to move at a speed so fast that everything else looks like a statue to her, this is triggered by a switch embedded in her teeth. Shia is unable to touch any living creatures, such as humans, when she's in this state, as the high speeds would kill or otherwise seriously maim the creature through air friction.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcHcS8DJYA66wx4xTCDNdix9taRpgVctR7r9vtrkBTodi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYQkp8ZvAfpfYk48oHHCYsTKhHunZpn2CaLPWAwcfviTu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcHcS8DJYA66wx4xTCDNdix9taRpgVctR7r9vtrkBTodi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YMe6ai849tbaf6jiLGuHP48nPHqLKc7Ay"], "tags": ["crypto", "cyborg", "robot", "gun", "alien", "halo", "planet", "thebizzare", "outerspace", "fantasy"], "extra": {}}
