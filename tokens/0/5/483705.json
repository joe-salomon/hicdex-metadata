{"__version": 1, "token_id": 483705, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SHEATHER HEATHERS", "description": "(You just had to do another one of these Andrew, didn't you?) Yeah, I did. This time it's more unique than the previous one. What makes this one unique is that HEATHER is the main word we can add an S to the front or the back of it and it creates two completely separate words. We wind up with SHEATHER (a person who makes sheaths) & HEATHERS (a plurality of a small dense Eurasian shrub). Out of these we can create the narrative: SHE EAT HER & HE EAT HERS. Looks like 2 women and 1 man are eating and one woman ate the other woman and the man ate either woman, we don't know. It is absolutely absurd and abstract; the way fun writing could/should be. Besides the nonsensical nature of the words, we have the fact that we actually could create a chain of SHEATHER & HEATHERS together in a never ending cannibalization of these three people. The root word HEATHER can technically be placed in a state of SHEATHERS and thus repeated for an infinite number of times. Might be interesting as a print perhaps; just a thought.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaPLDt8ri9CBFufJyoxrUoex3jGMXR633m35jCdXTSDBm", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc74wifyJ31z8uZYnRW57SxgmmsvS95L2EuzbgNeqsA72", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaPLDt8ri9CBFufJyoxrUoex3jGMXR633m35jCdXTSDBm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
