I am a multi media artist that uses fluid acrylics on canvas, my camera and digital editing to capture an image.   I use my camera to explore movement, depth and composition on my canvas then digitally alter my images.  My art is whimsical, trippy, bright and fun.  I play on the unpredictability of the process and use music and my love of surrealism as my inspiration.
