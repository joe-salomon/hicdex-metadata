Even today 'bakelite' is sought after as rare signifier of 20th Century material culture pre-WW2.\n\nThis digital \"token\" confers upon you\na portion of the aesthetic and para-natural\npower of this radiant meta-object.\n\nThink on the maker of this physical item\nand send them your gratitude\nthrough the centuries - for the\nprivilege of holding it's\nmeta-verse avatar.\n\nI took this photo and was blessed\nby this object and the sincere\nexpression of it's maker.\n\nI truly hope my photo gives a portion\nof that warmth and comfort to you.\n\nHPL", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmer4uMFCCHB7kMTqxWY1iEKnFHXXeYRGCBHrv6gD3UHM3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTvND74QECE2q34Y4SpaK5ymHjh8dagWCwPzCwZoip4hU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmer4uMFCCHB7kMTqxWY1iEKnFHXXeYRGCBHrv6gD3UHM3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Nh672Ln1KRwVgXVdS6NR3NcSWjUSPaFuB"], "tags": ["bakelite", "mirror", "20thC", "industrial", "vanity", "American", "magicitem"], "extra": {}}
