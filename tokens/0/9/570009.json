Most wouldn't survive the severe bleeding or the acute pain.\nOne day a man was unjustly sentenced to wear the Stone Mask of Penitence, he died within hours and so they removed the mask and tossed his body into a mass grave.\nSince that faithful day, every time a new act of penitence is forced unto a innocent victim, the mask is said to cry rivers of blood from every thorn, crack and orifice.\n\n\n\n800x800gif mouse drawn on a Deluxe Paint emulator for the MS-DOS", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPzKnYRqen1WxyMCySm3dzXkxu3GeRBLGHmVg5s15jAZy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPzKnYRqen1WxyMCySm3dzXkxu3GeRBLGHmVg5s15jAZy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPzKnYRqen1WxyMCySm3dzXkxu3GeRBLGHmVg5s15jAZy", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1g1vaPjfjPj2q6gsg7ddNQAQao955YTGAQ"], "tags": ["abandomware", "occult", "sigil", "mask", "penitence", "deluxepaint", "voidhands", "magic", "ms-dos", "blood"], "extra": {}}
