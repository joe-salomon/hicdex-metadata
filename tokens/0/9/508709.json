{"__version": 1, "token_id": 508709, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Spearit Bear - \u201cSword Tongue\u201d Music NFT", "description": "This NFT comes with a downloadable file of Spearit Bear's song \"Sword Tongue\" and a piece of GAN art (AI assisted) that also acts as the album cover. Purchase of this NFT transfers ownership of the digital file and image, not the right to ownership of the music itself. Commercial use of the image or the music file, aside from the resale of this NFT, must be requested and approved by Spearit Bear beforehand.\nThis song was written just before Spearit Bear moved to Puerto Rico in 2021. It was made actually in the place of another song, 'What is Due', that had to be put on hold once some of Spearit Bear's music equipment broke and they were unable to record their instruments. This is a full on expression of passion and a little frustration. Great for when you need an energy boost!\nThis audio NFT qualifies as one that can be collected to add to the 3 needed to be considered a \u2018Promoter\u2019 to receive referral bonuses from primary sales, and the 5 total needed for a collector to be considered a 'Distributor' and receive monthly Distributor pool payments from secondary sale royalties.
