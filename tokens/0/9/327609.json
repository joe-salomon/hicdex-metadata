Starting at \u00bd to \u2154 the height, the tree develops into a rounded, costapalmate fan of numerous leaflets. A costapalmate leaf has a definite costa (midrib) unlike the typical palmate or fan leaf, but the leaflets are arranged radially like in a palmate leaf. All costapalmate leaves are about 0.20 inches or 5.1 millimeters across, produced in large compound panicles up to 8.2 feet or 2.5 metres in radius, extending out beyond the leaves. The fruit is a black drupe about 0.5 inches or 1.3 centimeters long containing a single seed. It is extremely salt-tolerant and is often seen growing near both the Atlantic Ocean coast and the Gulf of Mexico coast.\n\nObservations: Sabal palmetto is a popular landscape plant in subtropical climates and used for its tolerance of salt spray and drought, and is moderately cold hardy. Because of their relatively long establishment period and prevalence on southern ranchlands, few, if any are grown from seed in nurseries. Instead, established plants are dug in the wild with small rootballs since virtually all the severed roots die and must be replaced by new roots in the new location. Most leaves are removed at this time to reduce transpiration. It is the state tree of South Carolina and Florida. They also grow along the Caribean coast and in South America.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUDBcLrWhcHpSEuQWi48CigHYCKZ3Q9kyzGwcGeDXkBcN", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8q3BJtPscBncaf9NDzq8NgkPQjuKyp2YTksVi3Q88Yg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUDBcLrWhcHpSEuQWi48CigHYCKZ3Q9kyzGwcGeDXkBcN", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1Nf8mQBpnaxK374yUbMLuUreYKughgwsaQ"], "tags": ["green", "collectible", "creature", "interactive", "animation", "3d", "glb"], "extra": {}}
