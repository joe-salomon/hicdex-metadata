{"__version": 1, "token_id": 377009, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Golden constellation", "description": "One of the main processes of experiencing trance is to allow mental processes to occur on their own. We ask the subject to \"relax and let events happen.\" Doing so is thus the main form of indirect hypnotic suggestion, which is especially valuable in inducing trance. Most people do not know that much of the mental process is autonomous. They believe in what they think by controlling their own associative processes. And to some extent it is. But it is a pleasant surprise when they relax and discover that associations, sensations, feelings, movements and mental mechanisms can act completely independently. This autonomous flow of undirected experience is an easy way to determine trance.\nQuote by Milton Erickson \n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2017, spray paint on canvas, 70x50cm. 3520x2477 pix\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTa8fCk58itNj5MsRWdSTLbrY8wznqUYtwnBZ12qKoLTd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbAz8zeoFd7Xy2ZzmSJjRVNfD9GBBkcdkjkxSqcxMYheg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTa8fCk58itNj5MsRWdSTLbrY8wznqUYtwnBZ12qKoLTd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["spraypaint", "denysenko_art", "abstractart", "painting", "art"], "extra": {}}
