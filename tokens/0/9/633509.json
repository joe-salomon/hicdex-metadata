{"__version": 1, "token_id": 633509, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "(P)RESIDENT", "description": "Looking back to recent events in the past is somewhat a hobby of mine. I love seeing the small details of things or events evolve and tracing back the change in culture or the schism in society. A couple of months prior to this point, 45 was officially out of office (thankfully) and instantly went from a President of the United States to just a resident of the United States. I thought about this work for awhile in terms of how I wanted to write it out. Originally, I wanted to do: (P)resident. As you may or may not have picked up so far, I try to boil concepts down to it's essence. By cutting out all the superfluous information and cutting to the chase, as they say, we get to the core of the art immediately. Unfortunately, (P)resident, just didn't tell enough information to express the sentiment. This is not limited to just Trump; every president will eventually be just a resident again at some point. Let's just take a moment and thank Stacey Adams for helping to register so many people to vote in 2020; elections have consequences.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY7YCp5sM1HhjUpJssuEWS5ZLFZQi678Z8682SFF2VTje", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPHsJMtXqu7KJ3JT8DjvdxguVjjLkjt8vhK7S1hxVe6up", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY7YCp5sM1HhjUpJssuEWS5ZLFZQi678Z8682SFF2VTje", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
