He is The One who deserves every manner of praise and we should exalt him. Join in extolling him by repeating \u2018al-hamdu lillah meaning \u2018praise be to Allah\u2019.\n\nAnd Moses said, \u201cIf you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely \u2013 indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy.\u201d (Quran 14:8)\n\nAnd We had certainly given Luqman wisdom [and said], \u201cBe grateful to Allah.\u201d And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever denies [His favor] \u2013 then indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy. (Quran 31:12)\n\nTo Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth. Indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy. (Quran 31:26)\n\nFalsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy.
