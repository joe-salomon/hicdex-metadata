Falling incessantly in the years of my youth allowed me to learn to fly. Premature deaths, disapprovals, running without getting anywhere, believing you were right and crashing into a fallacy. I still remember those hard years, sometimes I have tenderness or some nostalgia for them. It must be because of them that I learned that when falling, while not touching the ground, one can also experience flight. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNa5vQadY7rubt8xvZctrJYXFRFwcwdZUJawGRHby4HsH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcX1kFYXiuwnnqkR8GourYCrY6sfVvJ7GEUmtU7eqQzug", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNa5vQadY7rubt8xvZctrJYXFRFwcwdZUJawGRHby4HsH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1P3gQUxrecWX9NtRASFgecCWchPQEiqa2b"], "tags": ["metaverse", "characters", "fiction", "microstories", "photography", "portraits", "facatack", "photographer", "digitalart", ""], "extra": {}}
