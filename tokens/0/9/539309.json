The original footage is rendered natively in 8K resolution, not upscaled in post-processing. It is powered by the resolution-independent GAN that I developed earlier this year. The model is able to generate images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratios, including cylindrical 360-degree videos. Theoretically, there's no limit to the output resolution although resolutions above 8K require workarounds due to memory limitations. The first owner of the NFT will receive a version of the work in its original 8K (7680 \u00d7 3840) resolution.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmamxNsSH7VB4gRmzbMMb1Ethwcv4V7sQ36ELnAHVMhyxx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTMS59FUo2RDw92vRedmXLXRir5qBnuAWSdKwSzpK9Hcw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmamxNsSH7VB4gRmzbMMb1Ethwcv4V7sQ36ELnAHVMhyxx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YUHpSXWQ5hJoYgSXF2wZrSwwaQuHem1cz"], "tags": ["360\uff0cAIart\uff0cGANart\uff0cgenerative\uff0clandscape\uff0cloop\uff0cpanorama\uff0csurreal\uff0cverisartcertified\uff0cVR"], "extra": {}}
