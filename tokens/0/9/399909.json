The owner refused to take responsibility because he was going to prison less than 3 weeks. I didn't argue too much because I didn't want trouble focused on me. That man has connections out the ass and could get my place mopped up if he wanted to. Despite the cracks I still used it to make art for as long as I could (1.5 month). The Matte screen protector was the only thing holding it together so it bought me some time. Unfortunately now its no longer usable for my Artistic endeavors. I really need to get it repaired or replaced so I can function at my highest capacity. \n\nAll proceeds from this piece and my art will go towards repairing the biggest investment I've ever made in my art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY5xpL2E61pfVe5QPrMnw23jtbKhQRn9rzB2HLZU6taUb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmefFb3dxYcMmpx37vGGE4cD2WWwXigwWyL5BAE9RKmcrh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY5xpL2E61pfVe5QPrMnw23jtbKhQRn9rzB2HLZU6taUb", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fTki7R76gozDfUX7hfXbgww6daoKEzx1c"], "tags": ["tech", "art", "ipad", "procreate", "tez", "tezos", "edition", "crack", "cracked", "smashed", "sucks", "trash", "dammit", "godammit"], "extra": {}}
