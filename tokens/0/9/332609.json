Data on the first rays refer to the Lower Jurassic period (about 150 million years ago). Despite the fact that the stingray is a peaceful fish, they have survived most dangerous predators and natural disasters. But now their population is noticeably decreasing due to human interference in the realities of their habitat.\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of this art will be donated to The Ocean Cleanup, a non-governmental engineering organization based in the Netherlands that is developing technology to extract plastic waste from the oceans.\n\n----///----\n\n1920 x 1920 px / 25 fps / Loop", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXnd9CkhsY1uc99771kG7AyHLs7NP85vXZia8JzoTn6wZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRoxUHxdHdJ1QN7fucoAREqqq2goHMC9wdMLWiA6zXPtp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXnd9CkhsY1uc99771kG7AyHLs7NP85vXZia8JzoTn6wZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XUaJFNYXu4yEhQ53aFkfMD17cMuMmj63n"], "tags": ["DiamondAnimalsStingray"], "extra": {}}
