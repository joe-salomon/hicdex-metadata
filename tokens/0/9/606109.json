{"__version": 1, "token_id": 606109, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNFOLDINGS - Subdodecahedron Reassembly 01 / DARK", "description": "Reassembly of a subdivided dodecahedron lattice. Lattice is taken apart and put together by adding and removing nodes in various stages. Simulation is based on Fruchterman and Reingold's method for force-directed placement of nodes which includes both attraction (between nodes connected with edges) as well as repulsion (between all nodes). This piece was produced as an experiment in computational design research on lattice algebras.\n\n@lukapiskorec, mp4, 1000 x 1000 pix, 600 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfBbxGe5WKS7TXdcaWdejVaoqPLwRGmoNiMnrh3iWfawM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcfKnDYqnziLXrReyWMCatXdVf6M4PmHHi74poKm9SZgJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfBbxGe5WKS7TXdcaWdejVaoqPLwRGmoNiMnrh3iWfawM", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Lkgy2gYECvVK55yyiwjbSSZeUoQp8Azxo"], "tags": ["HEN600k", "lattice", "sculpture", "procedural", "generative", "algorithmic", "computational", "animation", "3D", "structure", "organic", "crystal", "geometric", "abstract", "architectural", "design", "graph", "matrix", "algebra", "unfoldings", "unfoldingsdark"], "extra": {}}
