Even though it's very tiring, we don't ask for anything in return, but just hope that he/she stays healthy and can actively act funny to accompany and cheer up us at all times. The days that go by are not felt until the time comes when he/she leaves us.\n\nToxic relationships that are obtained are sometimes painful but the thing that hurts more is the loss.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ4gQr6xBxE2xZk1iH66yBGpc9dDMGaDDkUx9TLq5ka9s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNNS63e7eJubCe3ouKGAeqHUXKR1i9nQ4LeS3qtxPXyQH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZD4DAj3exTSmrzgURr538NrFNPW6ux652CXH9qbqHfKt", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ4gQr6xBxE2xZk1iH66yBGpc9dDMGaDDkUx9TLq5ka9s", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Ac42Zn368R9Xxbscsu1cfmS4wSSmrdjfk"], "tags": ["cat", "illustration", "moodboard", "sad", "timegoes", "time", "metarupanft", "nftprizedmoments", "artmomentsjakarta"], "extra": {}}
