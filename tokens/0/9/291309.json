Those who know me personally know I'm from the Detroit area originally so when Tool asked me to be a part of the artist line up for the tour I requested my home town as one of the stops I'd do and they said yes! There's nods to the sculpture \"The Spirit of Detroit\" and a Michigan map peppered in for some backstory.
