Which is really disgusting for some people so they didn't get any noticed by us. But I captured them from microscope and I think this is interesting when I knew about how they moved, how their texture, etc. \n\nI want to bring people to realize there's a new way of looking at things so we get to know more about objects that are rarely noticed by most people. Maybe some people see an object based on the context of their own lives. In fact, objects are surrounded by the space where they and the people around them so create another meaning. \n\nThis video art is expected to bring people to discover and sense other meanings and a different way of looking at objects seen from a microscope.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQPQe948GxRBENVBBgChgzoH7r5Tn9WZ4j2L4ejni9PNQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPhQbai9ziCTXgjwB52Dx1q6qNbVaeYG2giv57NRD7Yif", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQPQe948GxRBENVBBgChgzoH7r5Tn9WZ4j2L4ejni9PNQ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RRwbViA2LvmfQtSJ1WD8bADqU1J86YfW5"], "tags": ["#videoart#microscope"], "extra": {}}
