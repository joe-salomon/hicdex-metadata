The family includes five genera and more than forty different species. They have remarkably large and colorful beaks, which have a thermoregulatory function for the many species that spend a lot of time in the forest canopy exposed to the hot tropical sun. They are very important for forest dynamics, as they disperse seeds far from the mother plant.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbL6tc9TQ7k6AYTotHFjW3ZdacBAumA7GGcoJaBcBjoUd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbL6tc9TQ7k6AYTotHFjW3ZdacBAumA7GGcoJaBcBjoUd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbL6tc9TQ7k6AYTotHFjW3ZdacBAumA7GGcoJaBcBjoUd", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Ng2K2Fubq3Mh4j5TJPKUCfsTv2fuKYDPB"], "tags": ["pixelart", "pixel", "mosaycs", "tucano", "illustration", ""], "extra": {}}
