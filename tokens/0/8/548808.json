It's not exactly a masculine thing to admit but I love cats. I'm a proud cat lady to be honest. In 2012 a month before Amanda and I were to fly to Hawaii to get married we discovered a litter of 5 kittens living under our parking garage. We were very short on time planning our wedding but we felt compelled to help them and spent nearly a week trying to catch them. We ended up keeping 4 of them and still have them today. We had never talked about having pets and before we knew it we had 4 of them, and I can't remember my life before them.
