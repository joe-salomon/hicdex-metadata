All the pictures show women in the best versions of themselves. The woman, like the red color for me, conveys sexuality, beauty and power. And the crimson color goes hand in hand with the woman.

A person is a man who combines style, intelligence, beauty, refinement, charm and uniqueness! A handsome man is handsome in everything. They say that by the look on your face and your eyes you can understand what\u2019s in a person\u2019s heart - so this picture doesn\u2019t need a face.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigdnr4f7ewf2of4uqiaek6lwh54qp277m2y4i34vo5gftgqb5cfzq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreia4wyokcoaphzxzly3qe5knpy74bpodpmtupeskmtqskzprxa6ika", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigdnr4f7ewf2of4uqiaek6lwh54qp277m2y4i34vo5gftgqb5cfzq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["redunion", "personality", "beauty"], "extra": {}}
