A voice came from that wound saying, \"I am the human heart, prisoner of substance and victim of earthly laws.\n\n- Khalil Gibran", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVscWJX8JxFmed8WKreCaRECk7YGy8mUEMbzvR8aCqfuc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbRCXyJh3UrtquYB4HJ64X4t5aWhPaBfVUyyCZwucPR8z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNP7vXSbXBXB4KXiJ7ECD817DCvha1NjXyKcfNYtD9zDa", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVscWJX8JxFmed8WKreCaRECk7YGy8mUEMbzvR8aCqfuc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UbeyXgCJ2MCdn9p529oDGNDPk9Fr1BZtH"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "collage", "blackandwhite", "agareds", "body"], "extra": {}}
