Abstraction 03 is dedicated to the \"Metaball\", \"Voronoi diagram\" and \"Delaunay triangulation\" transformations is operated in diferent way. The patterns are linked to draw the algorithmic abstract artwork with each other according to the linked energy of abstract processes.  Relationship of algorithms is realized with eight charged points as main triggers which are divided in two groups and are transforming the space around. Captured as a raw data from the custom \"node\" based algorithm. There is no postprocessing behind.
