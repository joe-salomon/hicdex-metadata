The problem is finding who is brave enough to overcome the fear of the Shouter's terrible screams. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW8A5fNbVK5yfa2XfDwFCoHtU7Bn1SJmJ74Z9mw8Tnyo9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf82daq6J6MJRvCVVD7gC52BxKZqnkqohopyxtv896met", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW8A5fNbVK5yfa2XfDwFCoHtU7Bn1SJmJ74Z9mw8Tnyo9", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["brazil", "forest", "legends", "cryptolegends", "characters", ""], "extra": {}}
