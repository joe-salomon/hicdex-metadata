On top, horizontal lines gently blend with the shapes underneath uniting the flow from silence to noise and from energy to stillness. \n\nIt is the space of the New, therefore of the Unknown, where the chattering finally fades away and what is left is all the silence and all the potential dissonance of the universe.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXCeixBsdQv9S49STbjjuoW7267js6R9DhuTcbsViP32S", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUzHFcf6noXYK8gEZ8FMnneTBiMZjLCU5aZarCoi2Fd5j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXCeixBsdQv9S49STbjjuoW7267js6R9DhuTcbsViP32S", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SLNVkcr3fPmAgWi4oWC9GhoGKY6brTeEq"], "tags": ["artwork", "gateway", "2d", "non-generative"], "extra": {}}
