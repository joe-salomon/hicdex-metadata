Just letting things flow, mostly frustrations of the past\u2026and one of the things I learned was burning the entry or destroying it as a way to \u201clet go\u201d..rather than ripping up pages, I decided to draw over my entries. The drawings didn\u2019t need to be related to the entry, but I wanted to flip the energies by spending time being free and feeling young again in a sense\u2026I am not an amazing drawer, I can doodle, but that\u2019s about it\u2026in 2019 I spent time doodling over a lot journal entries & besides doodling I really aimed for collage style pieces, drawing over stickers to add to the doodle, just to add more depth..I guess I was already a fan of layers & collage before realizing it. I\u2019ve always wanted to draw, but my only experience is like trying to draw anime style characters & a lot of influence from graffiti block letters in middle school during my time as a bboy & being a little more invested in hip hop culture/elements\u2026I\u2019m kind of rambling, but basically I decided to make a collage today & incorporate these personal doodles over my journal entries in 2019. By early 2020 before pandemic things, I had found a therapist and took a step back from the entries and doodles just because of time, but I still look at this sketchbook pretty often. I felt it was important to kind of refer back to them & see how to put it together with my art practice from today. I might add some of these journal doodles from that time to future digital posts here just to kind of put them in a new light and remind me of those times for a bit of motivation on future projects, etc\u2026.Being stuck today & questioning how does everyone create & post multiple times a day, I had to revisit these drawings & kind of remind myself of purpose & such..Maybe this isn\u2019t that aesthetically pleasing of a piece compared to recent works, but this practice is very important to me and my health..With that, thank you for your attention during this process.\n10-17-2021\n\ninstagram: @burnedbyairfryer\ntwitter: @no5ay_", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWwc9vQJpfefpzTL6VUn9HTfQYAUyyNJFRjcpVgvx5Dv4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU97BsobeKaSsScm9fNwAHQdUU5Yaxsn3AQufZArZ988H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWwc9vQJpfefpzTL6VUn9HTfQYAUyyNJFRjcpVgvx5Dv4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["burnedbyairfryer", "no5ay_", "digital", "art", "therapy", "mixed", "media", "illustration", "journal", "entry", "personal", "expression", "doodles", "2019", "collage"], "extra": {}}
