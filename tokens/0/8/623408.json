The cryptic amount is either 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, or 500, so six related trading cards make up a set. The Cryptic Sphere is a 3D graphic experiment by The Vectorizer. It is a play of changing shapes, lights, colors and surfaces. Each Cryptic Sphere is created individually by hand with great effort. There are recurring elements but no automated generation processes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWZqh8GZRMXD6JVdtu9XydJXMCctkWeCmWMJRwTbA465T", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR6GxMjuFfrJEbLtCdiXCA8FTwv9qdYKNHHgwyujwWzDZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXRwzcwdGPJWKo97iqQQWcQZspB9dg2X9uHudTWzA6NWt", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWZqh8GZRMXD6JVdtu9XydJXMCctkWeCmWMJRwTbA465T", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fdgiHWujDz1bbmRQKHTPdYpBwMdstu5hB"], "tags": ["art", "design", "render", "digitalart", "blender", "illustration", "drawing", "animation", "3d", "motiongraphics", "3dmodel", "3dartist", "3dmodeling", "cg", "cgi", "interiordesign", "surreal"], "extra": {}}
