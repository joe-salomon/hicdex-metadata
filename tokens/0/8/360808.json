We like to see how many people we can fool. This time I really wanted to try and create the illusion of a wet t-shirt on Natalie Mae. It's something I'd never done before.\n\nNatalie is a yogi. I'm not much into yoga, but I love being around people while they do it because the energy it puts off is super calming. Watching Natalie on the rocks gracefully stretch in her poses brought such relaxation to the already magic shoreline.\n\nAlso available on Opensea in MOTION\nhttps://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/111264837435920832084476769001979799246726519761492782389517233952528237854725\n\nperformer: @nataliemaeyoga\nbodypaint by Roustan (bodypainter.com)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcXmR4ThdfXqpbRZHVr18rbUfQACWpTzDQiay7SyJCFER", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme9VCsHT5ioMJpRxWq8aJPiaVK49FxSCbKMzXRMcoRkc9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcXmR4ThdfXqpbRZHVr18rbUfQACWpTzDQiay7SyJCFER", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QUmGXc9smSXGAgtJ3MG6LseXc5T4Ztdgm"], "tags": ["yoga", "beach", "photography", "model", "woman", "bodypaint", "nsfw", "peace", "water", "sun", "sunset", ""], "extra": {}}
