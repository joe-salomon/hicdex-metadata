{"__version": 1, "token_id": 632508, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BORN", "description": "\"BORN\" from METACHROMATIC SERIES (1/3)\nGraphite Pencil on Paper\n2550x3500\n300dpi\nPersonal Use Only\n\n- We are shall not be free from bad things. Actions based on greed, hatred and not knowing how to beat oneself. -\n\nIn my culture, freeing up birds from their cages during worship rituals as a meaning to let go of bad luck in life which also gives life to fellow living beings. This is a symbol of establishing a sustainable life with nature.\n\nIn Metachromatic Series I want to visualize in a surreal way that humans depicted as birds and unable to free themselves because they are self-trapped and controlled by the mind, subconscious and destiny as a human being. So all the bad value itself remains.\n\nI think \"BORN\" is the right title to introduce this series and for minting my first artwork.\n\nHope you enjoy and support it. Thank you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNVwJqcBCstvYBrXycVu6xoFye8M8euoPrVzMuS3EkeHy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWL4aQeCSdfq1nK2jgYCvrqjzmYx7pyMd9ZLzuPqRB3u8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNVwJqcBCstvYBrXycVu6xoFye8M8euoPrVzMuS3EkeHy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1KhHCLNtrVYrhCntjfqnviSbR1X8jXHZPA"], "tags": ["illustration", "drawing", "pencil", "portrait", "surreal"], "extra": {}}
