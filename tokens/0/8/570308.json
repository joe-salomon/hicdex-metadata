Being alone made me overthink pessimistically. I felt horrible when all the solutions you add up end up in the worst possible way. I was so afraid things were going to change in a bad way, even though it did not happen yet, even though there was so sign of it, and even though I knew it was only because of me overthinking. It was an unending loop of negative thoughts, round and round in a maze that I could not find a way out.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWkQBqxbWnJ1qtihnWyYUSUmcdTjQCKbYeNLHaWHuEj9u", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb6XyaMAX7uqbf6WMXb3raa5HvRDKFD2bEnb1CuPedMUv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWkQBqxbWnJ1qtihnWyYUSUmcdTjQCKbYeNLHaWHuEj9u", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gfSPNWJp8YtTCxntnhwHVKrF6XmkxkfMz"], "tags": ["abstract", "paint", "watercolour", "scribbleart"], "extra": {}}
