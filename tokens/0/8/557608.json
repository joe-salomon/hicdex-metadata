I found myself cogitating upon the unsettling scenario that was predicted and unfolded that evening. We knew that from the COVID19 pandemic would have a huge affect on the election. Lots of Democrats were trying to be safe and voting by mail to ensure their votes were counted and to be safe from the virus. Republicans opted to vote in person, which on election night caused what has been dubbed a 'Red Mirage'. A red mirage is the illusion that the Republicans were winning since they voted in person that day and the Democrats voted by mail, which those votes would be counted in the coming days. The white rage comes from after the election was called for Joe Biden and Trump called the election rigged and corrupt. Trump supporters showed up to many of the recount facilities and claimed that there was fraud endemic to the entire vote counting process. (which was a lie of course, proven over and over again by the 61 of 62 of lawsuits that were thrown out of court .) The blue barrage is a reference to the onslaught of Democrat votes that kept pouring in for Joe Biden. You could feel the electricity in the air when Joe Biden was finally called the winner.
