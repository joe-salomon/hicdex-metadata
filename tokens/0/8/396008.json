After finding on the Web the most famous works of Western art, a recursive neural network automatically describes them. This textual \u201ctranslation\u201d is then sent to another neural network which, from a memory of several million images, \u201ctranslates\u201d them into images.\n\nThe result is astonishing as it seems familiar and at the same time strange, like a hallucinated art history. It is because these neural networks are inductive libraries of millions of documents and send us back to our own memory. \n\nWe come back a second time on the history of art by discovering it as a first time. It resembles what we know but remains foreign to us.\n\nThis way of hallucinating the past opens the way to a new status of the truth, to a form of repair, of completion, of metabolization and of ambiguous nostalgia towards a posterior past which does not pass and an anterior future which is already far behind us.\n\n5000x5000px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRW8Q2ke11Y9eKpoYXHFCuHdvANA1sXsNo2L6FFeDedrv", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbuxao7LizpcmJH2WepuhXoii2rEq874uBcz1V65Vm2Wi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRW8Q2ke11Y9eKpoYXHFCuHdvANA1sXsNo2L6FFeDedrv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NJYgxg4SgchGgWV14FkSipkc3XGr3v8KY"], "tags": ["artificialimagination", "arthistory", "counterfactual", "automation", "fake"], "extra": {}}
