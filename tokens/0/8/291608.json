This is one of the first works in the genre of pure abstraction.\nI used a brush and acrylic and airbrush to create it. The composition is constructed as a conflict of geometric shapes and spots of paint in which only the act of the viewer's perception of the final composition is of decisive importance.\n\nThe language of abstraction is self-explanatory. Abstraction speaks body language. You just feel it like an overhanging cloud, wind, or the presence of a large object.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifuav5dfgzqz2zwgo22tpbt7ieb6asbloll7nbrdghliphtwafg2e", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibhfmqe7gl6xd6q3p5ymw4m256kzig7zr5ezj2iba7qrmc7gaj32a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifuav5dfgzqz2zwgo22tpbt7ieb6asbloll7nbrdghliphtwafg2e", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XPii2HoNJP1Qst7ukue1k9PVeKscP9qBe"], "tags": ["abstraction", "edgarinvoker", "acrylic", "fineart"], "extra": {}}
