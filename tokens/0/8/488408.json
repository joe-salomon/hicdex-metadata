They're not sure if this is a normal occurrence--this moving town's always in some sort of crisis. So they're cautious in the presence of these creatures they've never seen before.\n\nSome of the residents start asking if this has something to do with the current move, which usually comes with some bad luck. But no one's sure. Maybe it's just a random explosion happening here--which is weird because this rarely happens.\n\nThe residents start asking for more information on what exactly is going on and why there are so many lifeforms in this town. Maybe it has something to do with that nuclear reactor explosion many years ago?\n\n-----The \"town\" is produced by a random assignment of \"buildings\" in a phyllotactic spiral, while the swarm is via a random curve spline generator.
