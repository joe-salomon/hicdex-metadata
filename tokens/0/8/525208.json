Europeans briefly farmed the island in 1851, before it was turned into a quarantine station in 1875, a hospital during the influenza epidemic of 1907, and a small leper colony from 1906 to 1925.\n\nDuring its time as a leper colony, fourteen men were sent there, and two died there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTL8CMkCtSqexZciMFPmtWiyNoHXiD13Tim7WhYUnEoBV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcWsfpJsKnD6pYGEsLoSC6UKUgwTqJ67fF1BYyA46A7P6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTL8CMkCtSqexZciMFPmtWiyNoHXiD13Tim7WhYUnEoBV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YehHK3z2KRZ2pNuQBTfocF1NvTLGvvSRk"], "tags": ["island", "ocean", "newzealand", "photography", "wilderness", "nature", ""], "extra": {}}
