Ships in the distance blurred on the horizon on their way down the Channel to distant lands.\n\nI live by the sea and wake early to go out and see the sunrise. The sky is best before the sunrises, if there are clouds then the light reflects off them in many colours and the sea is dark in some areas.\n\nThe variety and beauty of the pre-sunrise morning is glorious and abundant.\n\nI love painting the sea in watercolors and using wood panels instead of paper has brought a whole new dimension to the paintings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbiQMXYY8jbf7bGLmx5UhvXg2d7PVL74YZSNaNrVvsK7u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZTCbRPSigFsAt3vbrqyS6pV7bUv5rkRfVoCV5gNjuRPA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbiQMXYY8jbf7bGLmx5UhvXg2d7PVL74YZSNaNrVvsK7u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": ["Sunrise", "Seascape", "Watercolor", "Painting", "StephanieFuller"], "extra": {}}
