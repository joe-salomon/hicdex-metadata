I had planned a whole series of GIFs based on this tool and now I can't follow through. Kinda hate the idea of getting a new phone, what if Dexter gets ahold of that? That'd be a shame. I've always been troubled by not always being able to follow through and this NFT journey on H=N is not much different. On top of all this, I recently bit into an apple and my fake tooth cracked and popped out, again. Just gotta ride this storm out and let the sadness pass.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYe9AYUmwpopHSrEDjH7op8VNVe3ScUfdMa9mf3YaC7fd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYe9AYUmwpopHSrEDjH7op8VNVe3ScUfdMa9mf3YaC7fd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYe9AYUmwpopHSrEDjH7op8VNVe3ScUfdMa9mf3YaC7fd", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2M3yNKfjHH8y8whX6xTz9MKAPUsGP6wLoH"], "tags": ["Confession", "sadness", "samsung", "galaxynite8", "animation", "sadness"], "extra": {}}
