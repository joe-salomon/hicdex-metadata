It became the exclusive religion of this country by a decree of King Filomenus(**), at the time of the monarchy. It is said that the king, under the effects of the vapors of The Night of the Frogs(***), saw various creatures who appeared before him and asked to be honored under strange rituals or else the country would burn in flames. \n\nPeppos are hermaphrodite beings that live in swampy areas. One of them is Self-Healing Peppo. This is a stealthy but curious Peppo and there are many people who claim to have seen them among the reeds in the swamp.They have a ruby color and sapphire hair, but the most beautiful thing about this Peppo is their honey-colored eyes and their scent of freshly cut grass. \n\nWhoever performs the correct rituals and calls this Peppo with caution and respect, achieves the gift of self-healing. In this way they will avoid having to visit doctors and hospitals for the rest of his mortal existence.\n\nSome say that this Peppo works as a placebo.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021\n\n(*) See OBJKTs #307756, #353041, #415410 and #538645\n(**) See OBJKT #439879\n(***) See OBJKTs #245972 and #560765\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRZauEuq9rUjGLPiwkYnoLeyeBaoDAYa94mkkBX2dFkzu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmetXzBKVvAmpw7UrbfcEEa4VDfjz2hDuHq3bjGbjung6J", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRZauEuq9rUjGLPiwkYnoLeyeBaoDAYa94mkkBX2dFkzu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Peppos", "Morondanga", "Stamp"], "extra": {}}
