Now I\u00b4m bigger than yesterday and mint this is a new step.\n\nThanks.\nSincerely,\nJuan.\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcJ2ApyJ1KuMbt9ryn11SnTi4KpBrvc55d2YaFtwfegeK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcZvgT91MxJxoAdMXJzYKCX3QE9iShG1HnVF83bCdUP1r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcJ2ApyJ1KuMbt9ryn11SnTi4KpBrvc55d2YaFtwfegeK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ichPK6qRDokxcguriiARTvsLkFzRvoXGp"], "tags": ["postcard", "cafayate", "argentina", "mountains", "southamerica", "argentina", "landscape", "photography", "author", "landscapephotography", "photo", "nftart", "hen"], "extra": {}}
