It's a heterograph, which is similar to a homophone in that they sound the same, but are spelled differently. HEROINE is a woman that is courageous and daring & HEROIN is a white crystalline substance that is odorless, made from morphine and is highly addictive. From this we can create a narrative that reads: HERO IN HER HEROINE, HER HEROIN. How does create an actual narrative? I made this when I was listening to an Amy Winehouse album, \"Back to Black\" and her deep, sultry voice over the soulful R&B reminded me of just how special she was. It's hard to believe she's been gone for over a decade now. Her exploits with heroin and other narcotic were that of legend. Substance abuse is a serious problem for so many people. If you know anyone that has a substance abuse issue, please reach out. They might need your help. If you, the reader have a substance abuse issue, please put down this book and call 1-800-662-HELP (4357). We don't want to lose another Amy Winehouse.
