{"__version": 1, "token_id": 573008, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Unforgiven", "description": "My work blends everyday occurrences from my life in Brooklyn with abstracted nightmares and crude humor. Trained as an illustrator, I tries to tell a story with every piece I make, developing a personal and slightly sinister narrative within each painting. Using candy colors, heavy patterning, and tight compositions, the work draws inspiration from American folk art, the cartoons I watched as a kid, and my appreciation for architecture. I am always striving to make work that is highly personal but altered enough to allow individual interpretations to be applied to every story I paints.\nSize : 1338  \u00d7 1600 px\nDate : 2018 ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRjczJAo44KMnDcNEC9UBaviKLZdM3F844NGd2i26PXC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYrBvJ5Sox462SxcuYfFFi3v9X4UUe5wnPyfzvtYdbNh9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmSRjczJAo44KMnDcNEC9UBaviKLZdM3F844NGd2i26PXC"}], "creators": ["tz1gsTBHe2x7xTnQNCnBGqpCcZoWefxFaBTz"], "tags": ["nude", "nudeart", "painting", "drawing", "art", "illustration", "psychedelicart", "psychedeliccolor", "random"], "extra": {}}
