The caldera is next to Mount Rinjani on Lombok Island in Indonesia. \"Segara Anak\" means \"child of the sea\" and refers to the blue lake's resemblance to the sea. The volcanic cone Gunung Barujari is at the eastern end of the lake and is responsible for its crescent shape. The lake temperature is 20\u201322 \u00b0C (68\u201372 \u00b0F), which is 5-7 \u00b0C (9-13 \u00b0F) higher than normal for a lake at its altitude. Hot magma below the lake is responsible for this anomaly. Gas bubbles escape from the lake floor, helping the lake to have a pH of 7-8.\n\nThe surface of Segara Anak is 2,004 metres (6,575 ft) above mean sea level (AMSL) and is Indonesia's second-highest caldera lake with an active volcano. The peak of Gunung Baru Jari is 2,376 metres (7,795 ft) AMSL. The lake covers 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi), with dimensions of 7.5 by 6.0 kilometres (4.7 by 3.7 mi), and has a maximum depth of 230 metres (750 ft).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSutWx2kvoWWyb8u5EoHqSetXaTBFT9K57nuJD5W9EqRk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVfUVMLC1Fz6KF1CSVV35Zs1LCpTwKMg7nEgsA6Fsf7wW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSutWx2kvoWWyb8u5EoHqSetXaTBFT9K57nuJD5W9EqRk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["Mountain", "rinjani", "hikking", "adventure", "indonesia"], "extra": {}}
