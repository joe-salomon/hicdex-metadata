Never forget that some of the best things in life are found when faced with hardship. \n\n | 2160\u200a\u00d7\u200a2880 [JPEG]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUwqDbLQYP69cyHsYJAJL1ar84tKv27euNoVYAAozHCm2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUiTGh5udnsStwEnuvYRfuEpKKRKWF8WUbsdG414MMdCo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmeHvuFXb1sVE4hBQCMSaVBkkF1QVomgT7CtrSFTy4tBEs", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUwqDbLQYP69cyHsYJAJL1ar84tKv27euNoVYAAozHCm2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SCVEqinpMpmLZEXm8y2DUB4Pwf2ewQvuJ"], "tags": ["zagestudio", "brunei", "3dart", "3d", "conceptart", "inspiration", "light", "dark", "darkness", "heart", "soul", "hardship", "sadness", "love"], "extra": {}}
