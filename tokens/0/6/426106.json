From the start of our day until sundown, this creature pressures and frames our perspectives\u2014 Leading us to blame many things in life such as: responsibilities and unfinished task as the root cause of our energy depletion. Often times, it can also took the joy out of a simple chatter with our peers during office break time. Sad, isn\u2019t it?\u2028 \n\n\u2028Monday has become a day we often frowned upon and truthfully, deep inside our hearts, we know that it doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. Just like another day, this too shall pass. \n\nAltogether with all the good and the bad within. How we want to let it pass though, is an entirely different story, that is up to our own hands to decide.\n\nArtist: Jemala \nTitle: Ode to Sundown\nFilmed and Edited by Senry Alvin\nFormat: 1080p MP4 with 320kbps stereo audio \nDuration: 01:16", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNeCdLLtKXGAY4TScWXAUPbRhMJtbPUc7G5Xx76iTrzef", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdYZoTsUgpcU6GUpzqszyDrxafKEv3mwyhrCs4JvGSY8S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNeCdLLtKXGAY4TScWXAUPbRhMJtbPUc7G5Xx76iTrzef", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2Ptv8gJFbPDZXMiNiJ9DMpt6tZMJyjJ9Fa"], "tags": ["itsmondayart", "henradio", "audiovisual", "indie-folk", "henmusic", "audionft", "jemala", "ambient", "folk", "nftune", "hicetnuncmusic", "nftunes", "nftfilm", "nftaudio", "nftsound", "audio", "hopeful", "cinematic", "acoustic", "sunset", "sundown", "indonesianmusician", "hicetnuncaudio", "indonesia", "mp4"], "extra": {}}
