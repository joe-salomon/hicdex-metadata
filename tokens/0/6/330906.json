Stunning looks, luxurious short-haired coats, and wonderful personalities are a few things that help these kitties stand out from the crowd.\n\nRussian Black, White, and Tabby cats are playful and personable, but not terribly mischievous. Happy to keep their families entertained, these kitties make amusing companions thanks to their high intelligence. Like their blue-haired cousins, these cats quickly learn which behaviors earn pats and praise from their human family members, and which behaviors are best avoided. They share the Russian Blue\u2019s sensitive nature; a loud scolding is likely to hurt this individual\u2019s feelings and send them into hiding.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdymtB6JbPFzMr6kYqHmfBvNAvZUs2Te7DrgroAJem5Jb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdymtB6JbPFzMr6kYqHmfBvNAvZUs2Te7DrgroAJem5Jb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdymtB6JbPFzMr6kYqHmfBvNAvZUs2Te7DrgroAJem5Jb", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["pixel", "pet", "objkt4objkt", "cat", "pixelart", "animal"], "extra": {}}
