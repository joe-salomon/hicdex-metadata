First restaurant he saw was the famous Dos Esposas Restaurante and headed inside. He saw they were preparing to offer two new menu items $CHIPS and $QUESO! He was so excited that he decided to stay and promote them! As an honorary staff member, Pandaz has been given the authorization to help release two new menu items at the restaurant, $CHIPS and $QUESO!
