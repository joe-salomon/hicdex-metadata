Once it's dried you can draw on it. Then you bath the plate in the acid so it can bite the drawing on the matrix/plate.\n\n-The aquatint is the technic that permit differents gradient greys on the plate throught the cooking of resin on it. Once the resin is cooked you proceed successive bath of acid, covering the clearer parts of wax through the process, until reaching the darkest part. \n\nThen it's inking and printing.\n\n----\n\n18x21cm, etching\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPuBiHsDbp9XBkoYQmKZPocp6uBikf35LYkzzcvdxSBbZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYdUVmxLno5z9DZ9McDes9VTZCYUNoEbx632zKit7imSP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPuBiHsDbp9XBkoYQmKZPocp6uBikf35LYkzzcvdxSBbZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RTyG19vPkLKBghpvn14gzkJNfqDuNiBFu"], "tags": ["Jeansaucisse", "I-diot", "etching", "aquatint", "eau-forte", "printmaking", "grotesque", "cartoon", "self-slavery"], "extra": {}}
