Hope was running rampant and there was something in the air that silently spoke of a potential a new paradigm for everyone in the world. It was this feeling that was TRANSFORMATIVE and one of my hopes was that it would have been transformative to First Nations people across North America and Indigenous people around the world. The transformative native aka transforNative; a reawakening of the cultures that created us all; a return to learning from wisdom and elders. Making money isn't and shouldn't be the main focus in life. There is so much to learn from First Nations cultures, but before we can learn, we need to acknowledge the sins of the past and make amends with the original peoples of these lands. And it's not just for North America, all former colonial powers need to make things right with their former colonies. You can't just sweep the past under a rug and pretend no one can see the lump under the rug. On this day, I focused intently on a TRANSFORNATIVE year for these people. Something I've learned from these amazing people is: Don't build walls, build a bigger table. They deserve better; they deserve true equality, justice, and a seat at the table. (A table they provided by the way...we're sitting at THEIR table. Remember that.)
