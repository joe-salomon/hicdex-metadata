They don't have a defined nucleus and they are made of angular geometric segments. There will be several trikaryotes organisms to collect. By collecting 11 different specimen unlock your new personalized trikaryote forever associated with your name. \n\nNew output | 1:1 | 1080x1080 | 240 frames | 0.6 second per frame\n\nWe are now past the initial performative evolution test. The time for collaborative work with Trikaryote enthusiast from all over the world has begun. \n\nThis Specimen was created under the supervision of Dr.@tiegenhof_ a collaborator from the GIF museum. He has made the joy of all Trikaryotes enthusiasts by exhibiting the specimen in his museum. Everybody from all around the world gather to examine these abstract organisms held by Dr.@tiegenhof_,working in collaboration with the Dr.@Tornopilsky who is responsible for the previous speciman, the TRIKARYOTE 12 was created. \n\nThis new specimen it is the second evolution step created in collaboration. The requirements for participating in the next Trikaryote evolution now includes owning Dr. Tornopilsky AND Dr.@tiegenhof_ specimen, as well as all the 10 others.
