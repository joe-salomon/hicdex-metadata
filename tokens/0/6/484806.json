Turning the stump of an arm into a morning glory by embedding nails, removing their own eyes - nothing short of death is out of the picture for these masochists who worship pain in all of its forms, and seek to share their \u201cblessing\u201d of pain with all they encounter.\n\nAcolytes of Pain often use tools to torture and mutilate their victims, and it\u2019s often better to die a fast death than let one catch you. They possess average human-level strength and durability, and so while extremely dangerous due to them seeking pain rather than recoiling from it, are merely Creeper level.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUJgU1jMT1eV15v9pPbfds1Rq1SbHX3pWw9WZrCNfG9Gz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSbDTmkF5c1LRm1LgHskgTJsJkYLgyDy55Cg85qU1G71T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUJgU1jMT1eV15v9pPbfds1Rq1SbHX3pWw9WZrCNfG9Gz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["horror", "darkart", "orderofthedarkwheel", "darkwheel", "demon", "pain", "monster", "horrorart", "creepy", "scary", "acolyte"], "extra": {}}
