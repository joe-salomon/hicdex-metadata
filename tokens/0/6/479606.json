{"__version": 1, "token_id": 479606, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Jazz On Bones", "description": "'Jazz On Bones', also known as 'Ribs', 'Music on Ribs' or 'Bone Music' are improvised gramophone recordings made from X-ray films. Mostly made through the 1950s and 1960s, Ribs were a black market method of smuggling in and distributing music that was banned from broadcast in the Soviet Union. Banned artists included emigre musicians, such as Pyotr Leshchenko and Alexander Vertinsky, and Western artists, such as Elvis, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, Ella Fitzgerald and Chubby Checker.\n\nThe thrifted/found/stolen X-rays were cut into circles and the center hole was burned into the disc with a cigarette.\n\nThis is a 24 frame 1440x1440 gif illustration released in celebration of Hen Halloween 2021. \n\nReleased initially as a edition of 78 as a homage to the 78 RPM speed the grooves were cut to and played.
