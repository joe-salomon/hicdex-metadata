The fun is finding the right words, the right theme, in the right context. In this image we see two sentences that look and feel exactly the same. Same beginning for each parts of the sentences, same layout, and even the same length for both sentences. Both are true and yet both are opposites of each other. Life is fragile and the odds that we should actually be alive are slim to none in our vast universe, yet we are here; you are reading this sentence. Proof of existence! Existence truly is in the minority of possibilities. On the other hand, extinction has wiped out something like 99% of everything that has ever lived at some point in 5 mass extinction events throughout the history of our planet. The odds of something that lives to become extinct are truly in the majority.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWJzUj3M8NN59UWjRFhnsQoD3M6DFQgmfjx28fb4CiNZb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVGmh2iop8LGgdEvfXfL7uxcekRTuM4u275K2qFZJ3tdr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWJzUj3M8NN59UWjRFhnsQoD3M6DFQgmfjx28fb4CiNZb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
