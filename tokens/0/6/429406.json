At its heart is the simplicity of the square, the fundamental concept of the grid and a constraint of working in monochrome. This then distorts into something else. Runes, toxicity, gravity wells, monism, light and density all fight to be included, sometimes in harmony, sometimes in conflict and disarray.

But at the boundaries is where the interest lies. \n\nhttps://www.interpunct.studio/blog/borg\n\n150 editions were produced, each minted edition is unique.
