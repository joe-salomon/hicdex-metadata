On reviewing them afterwards, a particularly contrasty image resonated with some of the fleeting thoughts I had had there about the contrasts this land has seen, from rich native bush to denuded farmland and what it might see in the future.\n\nThis study was created by processing the photograph with creative coding tools \u2013 specifically vpype flow imager \u2013 to produce the linework. It was plotted by a vintage Houston Instrument DMP-161 plotter using a Rotring technical pen and custom mixed De Atramentis Document ink on A2 Hahnem\u00fchle Stella Matt 250gsm fine art paper.\n\n8000x2800px JPG\n\nMuaupoko / Otago Peninsula, Aotearoa \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddff\nPhotographed Oct 25 2021\nProcessed and plotted Dec 4 2021\n\njimmykl.tez \nhttps://jimmy.is", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaDNW3yyTseWU9fy4rebGZz2bHFT6NBBg1UxNex2EKqjp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVjpmoPpHStHMrmQkAn7PW86Y5x9DsRn9fgLiSPcVKRuj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQFqGaJMw4KsdrD7suTLjrqUXDWEcCwZGyPoqRkmCTTJo", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaDNW3yyTseWU9fy4rebGZz2bHFT6NBBg1UxNex2EKqjp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hZ7Q55pbwK26Se2U32iLk57LH4pxGN6VE"], "tags": ["clouds", "landscape", "plotter", "plotterart", "drawing", "generativeart", "lineart", "physical"], "extra": {}}
