I consider skateboarding one of the most dynamic and visually incredible feats of human athletic achievement. Many people call it a sport; it's not. It's more of an artistic kinetic expression of movement through time and space. Team sports have specific goals and are played in specific arenas or courts. Skateboarding happens anywhere there is smooth enough pavement. It's the kind of activity that teaches you patience, perseverance, friendship, community, open-mindedness, style, physical fitness, and so much more. Watching skateboarding is like experiencing a ballet performance; when it's done with style and grace, it's transcendent. There is nothing like getting on a skateboard and just rolling down a street or the moment you learn a new trick and land it perfectly. Ask any skateboarder about how they feel about it. They might use different words, but trust me the feeling is universal.
