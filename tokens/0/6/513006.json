And now I witness their creation in the mirror and finally see myself for how beautiful I am. How beautiful each one of us are.\n\nEach of our varied skins, sizes, types, hair, muscles, and movements are beautiful to witness.\n\nAnd this piece is in celebration of that appreciation. The grace by which we are alive and can witness the world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaSemM7B9wwKXK9EjBf2utcTqGa3rdmDoKn98w9a4sZmk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRQYEgsGwA5AoYVhozoDwLbX2EKyTczLNorw1T4k36Bgu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaSemM7B9wwKXK9EjBf2utcTqGa3rdmDoKn98w9a4sZmk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XQCw5VDcAxy83yQKcH7w4TX1mdEay4Q8S"], "tags": ["love", "selflove", "selfacceptance", "selfappreciation", "bodypositivity", "happiness", "openness", "grace", "god", "peace", "bodyappreciation", "world", "gratefulness", "bodies", "inlove", "growth", "cells", "joy", "blessing", "blessed", "appreciation"], "extra": {}}
