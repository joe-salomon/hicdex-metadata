Dated 9-1 and created in memory of the World Trade Center attacks. Now that the towers are gone all we have are postcards to remember them by. I was stuck in Europe when 9-11 happened. When I finally returned to the USA I couldn't find a postcard after the attacks so I drew one in my sketchbook. Created by Nite Owl, 2021 for the 20 year memoriam. 3600 x 4800 png. @naitooru (Twitter) @naito_oru (IG)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihci5ihnewokvgf3no2enqurqahjnrlvlmsowdqzaeex7si57lb7a", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigcoesmlzgj4dhmqp224szcbkkwzxozpnwqhcl57fli42kyhfelvq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihci5ihnewokvgf3no2enqurqahjnrlvlmsowdqzaeex7si57lb7a", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PABDPXbg9rqz62umCaQ8YhCUajmoYK2Cb"], "tags": ["nyc", "911", "newyorkcity", "newyork", "nineeleven", "sketchbook.pencil"], "extra": {}}
