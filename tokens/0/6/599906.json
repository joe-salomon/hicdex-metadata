Circuit bending was a gateway to electronics design on the one hand, and glitch art on the other.\n\nPrior to 2012, I identified as a circuit bender and with the circuit bending movement. The art of the creative short circuit led to deeper explorations of electronics systems from hardware to software.\n\nCircuit bending overlaps with glitch art in ways that made it natural to shift from hardware hacking and modification to software hacking and data manipulation.\n\nYear of the Glitch chronicled my personal exploration and development of mastering the materials, processes, and concepts that Circuit Bending and Glitch Art both share.\n\nThe first post is an image taken with a circuit bent digital camera and is part of a larger body of work that probes into post-digital photography. The camera revealed to be a hardware simulation of traditional photographic processes and calls into question the definition of photography in the post-digital age as well as to whether traditional photographic dialogues are adequate when discussing digital work and its distribution networks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmajTfUY29JBetKv9MqWZC2rVQzBXJCumTyejprmMPeDLe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW6Q1Juo8kUpbwF5tUAp73hMxmsAPWLjvPB3HJFWD4Dof", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmajTfUY29JBetKv9MqWZC2rVQzBXJCumTyejprmMPeDLe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UH4wWsGkkjyBJ9vF2aCL1APHQxGmr7Lod"], "tags": ["yearoftheglitch", "yotg", "glitch", "glitchart"], "extra": {}}
