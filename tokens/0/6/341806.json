It's the ultimate point for watching, a little higher on the ground where we can see all parts of our village, and also the next village far away.\nThe village ends here, we stop to visit our shelter.\nThis is the other window you see in front of you, when you come inside from the entrance door. The front window is for checking if someone comes, a farmer or a stranger who knows us. In our tiny village, everyone recognizes a stranger.  \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaHM9nK75c8eWKHc3nvLQn4dutSxX7aFnCmoHXFP5E9c8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV7W6fXM6hogZpgaS9wXjfAJwr2cmozKbrEqWPUh8ZCta", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaHM9nK75c8eWKHc3nvLQn4dutSxX7aFnCmoHXFP5E9c8", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["photography", "window", "people", "landscape", "photo", ""], "extra": {}}
