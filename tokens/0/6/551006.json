After spending 6 months in lock-down, we left NYC on a whim in search of something different. We settled into an upstate cottage secluded on the side of a mountain, where we are surrounded by nature and have no neighbors in sight. Here, we are free to be ourselves, even if that means being naked in the garden. Recently, Charlie slipped and fell on the wet grass and I quickly doused him with the garden hose and snapped this shot, which to me captures the absurdity and joy of everyday moments in love. It\u2019s moments like these that remind us just how fortunate we are to have found each other. And how privileged we are to live as proud members of the gay community, tending to a garden\u2014albeit nude\u2014just as any other \"normal\" couple would.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS1T7CG1zWHKZkFTmE5uz5QJBc4sSQANxNv2bav6THikz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW28zAeHuPMfiupTe3mcuo4vHqVYkZhY9DCtXo7CREXtN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS1T7CG1zWHKZkFTmE5uz5QJBc4sSQANxNv2bav6THikz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2H4ZfCbgJ3YEYZPn6D4itMQV6bgHg8cTuh"], "tags": ["truesy"], "extra": {}}
