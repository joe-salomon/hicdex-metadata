But, as the popular name \"devil's breath\" suggests, it can be very toxic (specially it seeds and leaves); so I strongly don't recomend the use if you don't really know and are habituated to the plant.\nIt has been described as \"Datura suaveolens\", an synonymy, but later Berchtold and Presl (1823) transfered the species to the Brugmansia genus.\nIt flowers have a notorious fragance that can be noted in the evening, it atract butterflies - which pollinates the pant.\n\nID: Brugmansia suaveolens\n\nI'm a brazilian woman artist, you can find me at twitter by @ocvvvlta.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfAfh81niKvXvg6fP66VKWEfi6LZEAkK2NkXRtd2NmsY7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfAfh81niKvXvg6fP66VKWEfi6LZEAkK2NkXRtd2NmsY7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfAfh81niKvXvg6fP66VKWEfi6LZEAkK2NkXRtd2NmsY7", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Tk4hbkA49TPyyqyLYBLBygz7S2nRCMQpd"], "tags": ["WitchingHourOnHEN", "nature", "flower", "poison", "pixelart", "gif", "brazilianartist"], "extra": {}}
