{"__version": 1, "token_id": 407600, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO BUFFALO.", "description": "\"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\" as crazy as it looks is actually a grammatically correct sentence in English. It uses both homonyms and homophones simultaneously. The effect creates complicated and compounded linguistic structures. The phrase was coined by Dmitri Borgmann in 1967, when it appeared in Beyond Language: Adventures in Word and Thought. The sentence has three completely distinct meanings of the word buffalo: 1. a proper noun referring to a specific place, Buffalo, which is the city of Buffalo, NY; 2. a verb: to buffalo, (which means to bully, harass, or intimidate or to battle; 3. a noun referring to the animal, the bison (in North America, Buffalo). Interesting to note is that the plural of buffalo is buffalo, similar to moose (singular) and moose (plural). The best way to translate this incredible marvel of a sentence is: \"Buffalo bison that other Buffalo bison bully also bully Buffalo bison.\" Did that melt your brain yet? The elegance and ultra-minimalistic approach to this sentence is beyond mind blowing. Borgmann is an underground legend for wordplay enthusiasts. This is an ode to him and his work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT8ZKokdaLtH1UiNgZSJD7q2ZeXJQiGzCWEZYUN3BdyS4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmetxjpreAjopnN52teTLjKXfQ9Nwx1dH1EobrpHMGcWPP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT8ZKokdaLtH1UiNgZSJD7q2ZeXJQiGzCWEZYUN3BdyS4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
