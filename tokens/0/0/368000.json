There are free roaming deer everywhere on the island, numbering in the hundreds or more. The deer are considered sacred in the shinto religion, and they proceed without bother from either locals or tourists. \n\nOne of the most famous torii in Japan is in the harbour at Itsukushima. This \"floating\" torii raises and lowers with the tide, and at low tide you can walk out onto the harbour floor (pictured) to see the gate up close.\n\nColour photograph. 3966\u200a\u00d7\u200a2644 JPEG.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX1wPk5DBLUS2FwY9J9gkLr5ZqZxqEEhKJC8tVHi9fiVt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmehP3UsPaqLC7o4DYRTXzFoJ9vjNYRTLQT2MgPuF1to1z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX1wPk5DBLUS2FwY9J9gkLr5ZqZxqEEhKJC8tVHi9fiVt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lrvhdv6vyLETQAVmrnqVdoT5h7LeQ1zC2"], "tags": ["colour", "photography", "japan", "itsukushima", "torii", "harbour"], "extra": {}}
