Please Stand By, Redesigning Fashion. Earlier this week fashion icon Virgil Abloh passed away from cancer at the age of 41. Abloh, the son of Ghanaian immigrants, grew up surrounded by and in love with skate culture. While he originally studied engineering and architecture during his degrees at University, it was his love for skate culture that brought him into the fashion world. With his brand Off White, Abloh elevated streetwear from fringe fashion to designer, and while his influence on hype beast culture cannot be understated, even more impressive is his trailblazing of the designer industry, where he became\u00a0the first Black man to serve as Louis Vuitton's director of men's wear in 2018. This monumental hiring will hopefully inspire future generations of young black male designers to chase their dreams. His trailblazing importance will not be forgotten. RIP Virgil Abloh 9/30/80 - 11/28/21\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNiBkU9PMspwn93gBQ5Ufo8KrgHaGhfmBJ3WWhcZ17G3u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVCmQfUyUgvLBj17DqNA5qaS8NGyqHRazV64D1ygTv4mf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNiBkU9PMspwn93gBQ5Ufo8KrgHaGhfmBJ3WWhcZ17G3u", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
