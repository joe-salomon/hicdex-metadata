Based upon the present composition of the soil and minerals, architectural typologies respond accordingly through a process called polymorphism. When an infusion allocates iron, it responds with a \"storage facility\". When it allocated a large collection of Phosphor or Lithium, it responds with a mobile collection unit etc. Architecture today lends itself so an assembly of discrete functions and parts. Nano responds with a homogeneous assembly of a singular intelligent-material that can respond to the environment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQA3widQQDDPJ3Aqs745hVftrHYLcHxVrRicVLVzLAzbG", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc4tw8JSJ7RrTz8f6pG1oSg41seLf62AjaeQ8GX78xW8F", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQA3widQQDDPJ3Aqs745hVftrHYLcHxVrRicVLVzLAzbG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fSL9BdNNG5ZxGDF92qvwqN23rCuYRiWRn"], "tags": ["Architecture", "discrete", "homogeneous", "programming", "intelligence", "assembly", "synthetic", "jorisputteneers", "artificial"], "extra": {}}
