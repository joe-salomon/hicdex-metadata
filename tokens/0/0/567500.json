Because our eyes will be filled with tears and our hearts will be filled with regret.\n\nEven the moments of happiness in front of us can make us look back on the lost time and the heartfelt reverence. We will imagine ourselves wanting to go back and fix that situation again and again. Even though you yourself know very well that it will never be possible.\n\nAnd that's because our heart was filled with \"regret\".\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQygQTA5UjxjXDkuJ6BKmP9hqndygJVpQPq6o66UEaWRK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQxk3KuZpGg1VhHNX7gTMAbk8mRNf9v3Wzjfmwt1hNz7y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQygQTA5UjxjXDkuJ6BKmP9hqndygJVpQPq6o66UEaWRK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L4D1pNmrUeyWCPGX8QGcWh4q6az3r62bi"], "tags": ["illustration", "b/w", "b/wofgirls", "girl", "woman", "drawing", "feeling"], "extra": {}}
