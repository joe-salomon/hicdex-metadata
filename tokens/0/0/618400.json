That deity arose from the waters and invented the moon, the world and all the stars. Huiracocha \"has always been\", and created time by ordering the sun a cyclical movement over the terrestrial sky. I'm going through a new year with my friends, on a planet that still seems strange to me. I advance walking, running, flying. Other times I stop, lie down and wait for the sun to rise again from the sand on which I float. We keep creating, 2022. We keep creative and winged.\n\nDear friends and collectors, I hope this new year is filled with art, prosperity, and enjoyable learning. Thank you for support me on my journey. I wish you the best. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdAWLbqMBPzmkZtUy49Jq47Fgu6Wr9Kd2uwTpiCdKUAFm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZzPz1RuRpc17E4MLDYSvr6eqjiCgUBaLDnRHw6G7eE4b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdAWLbqMBPzmkZtUy49Jq47Fgu6Wr9Kd2uwTpiCdKUAFm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PCCyzHPujMqhh4aEbdDWvvzNf4KKzyGTw"], "tags": ["collage", "surreal", "analogcollage", "newyear", "2022", "nft"], "extra": {}}
