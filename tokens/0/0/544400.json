The rails of democracy during this time period were tested. Anger on the far-right began to seep out of the woodwork and drip toxic, racist fermentation directly into the mainstream of Republicanism. People of the future, please know this was a very precarious time in US History as throughout the history of American Elections, there has almost always been a peaceful transition of power. It was an absolute shit show in the worst way possible. Trump's administration was less than cooperative with the incoming Biden administration during a pandemic that was raging out of control, people getting infected, being hospitalized and dying, economy in tatters, social unrest and inequities, etc. Joe Biden and his team would basically have to rebuild the entire infrastructure and bring back a sense of normalcy and professionalism that the previous administration lacked. (Lacked is probably too kind of a word to describe the time between 2016-2020; it was a shit show.)
