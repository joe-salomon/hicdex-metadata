As a punishment for his actions, the couple is cursed to birth monsters, all under the seven miseries of humanity: fear, pain, crying lament, hunger, thirst, disease and death. \nThe seventh son, the Lobison, transforms into a beast at night. He is doomed to live feared and alone, and eats not the living, but searches in rural cemeteries for the rotten meat of the dead. \n\nThere's a national law in Argentina called \"presidential patronage\" where the president has to become the godfather of the seventh son of any Argentinian family, most popular folklore in the country being a combination of european catholicism and indigenous beliefs. When baptized, the child gets to be saved from the curse and a welfare pension till he becomes of age.\n\nLobison in mid-transformation(3d modeling /digital collage /digital painting)\n\n\ud835\ude09\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude38\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22 (@\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude38\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXJJzkz2KGfBbbVZL3pGi3qcR8bQjbnBMpjFmpYSUrPMo", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma6A6C2KKLR24Vaxi8Y64rgeCfAst9pxN7qrWnBqkWcFe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXJJzkz2KGfBbbVZL3pGi3qcR8bQjbnBMpjFmpYSUrPMo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
