With not regrets and nothing but a gift of an opportunity, I look forward to the harvest for all of us. #collared\n\nThis song is one of my stories when I do Queer Core. I come from Southern roots, gospel music, soul food, and cast iron pancakes. I have learned to say enslaved instead of slave, as language is powerful. A slave has no past and no potential. An enslaved person is human and placed in captivity. How shall I refer to my roots? We are called to walk in faith, to till the Earth, and to hold onto the legacy from before captivity.\n\nI hope you enjoy this ode to the musical roots, especially the ones that came from my mother. Unchained. Free. Faith filled. Blessed. Check out this bathroom/ closet flow remix. I decided to share this one early, in honor of all the folks who cannot gather to celebrate their loved ones passing into ancestry during Coronavirus 2020.\n\nlyrics\nI stand before my maker\nThey are between\nMe and the darkness\nAlways\nBefore and after\nI stand between\nHeaven and earth\nRoots planted\nAnd when they called\nI wasn\u2019t afraid to answer\n\nCollared (I wasn\u2019t afraid)\n\nI kneel to pray\nPlant these seeds of faith\nLessons\nDirt on my face\nI kneel between\nThe hardest ground\nThe softest dirt\nNo empty pursuits\nPlenty of food\nA harvest\nHarvest\n\nBlood of Queens\nBlood of Slaves\nOut of the darkness\nBreak these chains\n\nBlood of Queens\nBlood of Slaves\nOut of the darkness\nBreak these chains\n\nCollared (I wasn\u2019t afraid)\n\ncredits\nfrom Queer Core: Behind the Music, released November 27, 2020\nAll instruments by QueenEarth\nBass and Vocals by QueenEarth\nMixed and recorded by QueenEarth in Baltimore, MD\nWritten and composed by M Smith\nExecutive Produced by QueenEarth\nMixed and mastered by QueenEarth\n\nNFT owner has the right to resell the art NFT, to publicly perform and privately or publicly display the art.
