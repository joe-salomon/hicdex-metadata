The initial generation is a grid of 128x128 cells on an unconstrained plane, where 50% of randomly selected cells are alive.\n\nThe image is generated with a custom renderer I wrote in C#.\n\nInitial random seed: 8\nResolution: 4096x4096", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbfZu7bwBPsfR9JHBd5wWUv3JKL1XuRMdxkGq3gihiwJW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVpvawACwPvCyHq88wzmgxPAgjTQmSQdsNPFVSu9Le2Wh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbfZu7bwBPsfR9JHBd5wWUv3JKL1XuRMdxkGq3gihiwJW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KDeWyeCeu2eZYLav9PrRAQmFCyESNF4Es"], "tags": ["cellularautomata", "complexity", "simplicity"], "extra": {}}
