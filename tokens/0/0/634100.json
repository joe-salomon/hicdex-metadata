Dictation of thought in the absence of all control exercised by reason, outside of all aesthetic and moral preoccupation.\n\nThe Visual Art's is to find magic and strange beauty in the unexpected and THE UNCANNY, the disregarded and the unconventional.\nAt the core of their work is the willingness to challenge imposed values and norms, and a search for Freedom.\n\nSurrealism aims to revolutionise human experience. It balances a rational vision of life with one that asserts the power of the unconscious and dreams. \n\n______\n\njpg | 2022x2020 | Visual Art by Lucidity25\nHuman | #1 | @lCDTY25\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfLu5i5ok64xiB9WnJo4gg4vUmyGQRHSnPE54hESWF8nW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWiUk9srH2XaEgPVjifepzV7q7gBrn9fqvfq7Ga3wxWwB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfLu5i5ok64xiB9WnJo4gg4vUmyGQRHSnPE54hESWF8nW", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2GT9T6qEKw5GjDUurvLNtHED1crcfkcCFu"], "tags": ["human", "surrealism.collage", "girl", "nude", "bondage", "nsfw", "digital", "surrealist", "surrealistic", "lucidity", "inside", "earth", "nudeart", "bondage", "pointofview", "missplacement", "natural", "digitalart", "visualart", "psychedelica", "vintage", "surreal", "NSFW"], "extra": {}}
