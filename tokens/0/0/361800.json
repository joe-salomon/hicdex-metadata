To tokenize the artwork McCoy used monetized graphics, a first version of a blockchain-backed means of asserting ownership over an original digital work that McCoy and Anil Dash had hacked together. The original minting used NameCoin blockchain (a fork of bitcoin), but the artwork is preserved on a token minted on Ethereum in 2021 by the artist and sold at Sotheby's for 1,472,000 USD.\n\nThis artwork, part of the Coilgram series (read more at bit.ly/coilgrams), is fully determined by the hash of the original NameCoin transaction, inscribed in the artwork, that minted Quantum on 3rd May 2014 at 01:27:34 UTC.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaycUhP3XgVba5wdJDKHcMkNV9ZUTb1DH4YwWFmMmqJtL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPwrkkFEBeXzCrsJyxKx7CCyzpBdG46XzUpuiGxV2ACaM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaycUhP3XgVba5wdJDKHcMkNV9ZUTb1DH4YwWFmMmqJtL", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1ZfiZNVhTCTBPr6XwTpVsczD2X43brmpWB"], "tags": ["Quantum", "coilgram", "NFT", "KevinMcCoy", "AnilDash", "monetizedgraphics"], "extra": {}}
