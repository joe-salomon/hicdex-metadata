You may find that your path was never one of exile, but one of forgiveness.\n\ndo not let the doubt flowing in the stream of consciousness guide you.  Take this cavern as a place of solace and respite, not one twisted by fear.\n\n--self", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ4bHN7wkMkrzgBJnhXQPxxcoxX7BXHwnXMW2Xp9T5qaG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbbPLa12mUNbTTNbuiezsTKjhyv1VKgwXpzTwiR1QrFKD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ4bHN7wkMkrzgBJnhXQPxxcoxX7BXHwnXMW2Xp9T5qaG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UhNv9jXLAUvZMUxYSDzNQjgUtQ18VzRVR"], "tags": ["oils", "sex", "eternaljest"], "extra": {}}
