{"__version": 1, "token_id": 404400, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "DONALD J. TRUMP, PT. II", "description": "Awe...cute you thought I was all done with the all out verbal assault on Trump. Yeah, there's more. Sorry, not sorry. Future generations of people need to know how awful he was and how he poisoned the well of politics and society. He curiously mentioned in a speech that back in May 2020, that \"We have met the moment, and we have prevailed.\" Sorry, future generations of people reading this, but we did not prevail in this moment. Quite the contrary, this was a collection of missed moments that can only be called PREFAILED. He and his administration (if you can call them that), prefailed on just about every metric of measurement used to qualify, quantify to hold leadership accountable. They did nothing to stop the spread of the disease, if anything he tried used the chaos to his advantage, which ended up killing over 700,000 Americans, lost both senate seats in Georgia, lost important battleground states that subsequently lost the 2020 election, lost on just about every way possible, except one, his soul. He didn't lose it because he never had one to begin with. How is this art? Great question. If you're this far into the book, you're seeing patterns. It's finding new ways to express emotions, thoughts, and/or conceptual content, etc into the simplest and most direct vehicle; language.
