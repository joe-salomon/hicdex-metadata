This generative artwork was released as a limited edition mint [1/150] on Hic Et Nunc by Kenny Vaden. A two layered orange and transparent yellow background were drawn, followed by seventeen layers that were each composed of 15 to 100 horizontally stretched and vertically displaced circular polygons, with similarly warped circular holes cut out. Layered orbital stripes were filled with colors that alternated between a bluish gradient and a reddish gradient, and varied in transparency, with dark gray edges of varying widths. This fairly simple design was a composition that stubbornly resisted the addition of any more points or lines. Less is more sometimes. Large numbers of circles within the confined space produced an illusion of paint streaks and glowing warm depths. The image dimensions for this file are 16x20 inches and resolution is 300 DPI, which produced a file size below the limit, which provides a higher resolution (more detail) than the original version shown online.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRWMDEvVATV874aKnPYtGn3EbUHHxeT95jSsuvN3ZYFmB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZQteZvbqM1ZDbYkXxQMVqgpr4QGnpAjuoy1szsSLrzwr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRWMDEvVATV874aKnPYtGn3EbUHHxeT95jSsuvN3ZYFmB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bEHdSDNdTTPmuin84c6LWqruepu6a5sc5"], "tags": ["Circles", "GenerativeArt", "RCode"], "extra": {}}
