There's one side of me that's dark and trapped, allowing negative beings to control my mind and heart, weighing me down and pulling it apart until I'm a mess. Then there's a mini-me, the constant self-destructing voice in my head, that makes me feel as if I'm sinking and fading away. The other half of me wants to float away, let go of negativity and allow myself to grow and be the person who I've always dreamed of being.\n\nThis is a very personal piece for me. I've dropped hints on my blog over the past 11 years about my mental health. However, I've never explained in detail as I struggle to talk about my feelings. So I've enjoyed creating this piece to visually explain how I'm feeling rather than talk about it. Art has enabled me to share more of my emotions than I ever would in words. I've hidden a few messages in the piece that have been a causing factor to make me feel this way.\n\nI wanted this piece to be bold, childlike and messy. Because life isn't neat, it's rough, patchy and uneven at times. It's never perfect so I didn't want such a personal piece of art to be perfect either. I wanted it to be me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdaQZvxKgZG5eumbyiKWPT4DXqVztVryHvcDKk3vHMqzS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVSmRojffx7Fp71vuDGBoajNf6sT2J8noCe9do4P6AoSR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdaQZvxKgZG5eumbyiKWPT4DXqVztVryHvcDKk3vHMqzS", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1djbeg9EgSdNDseGKz3SwJiwg4Jj5awDLf"], "tags": ["sianvictoria", "depression", "mentalhealth", "bold", "feelings", "emotions", ""], "extra": {}}
