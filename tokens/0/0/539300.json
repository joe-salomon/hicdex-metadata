It is natural, but cultural values need to be preserved somewhere. I think NFT is well suited for this purpose.\n\nRather than focusing on a single piece of graffiti, I chose a photo of multiple pieces of graffiti that come together to form a single landscape.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc9zSBf3MUMML3MCx2G3MyxVeYv2QoBNiaXzDPDqnmuLB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQh2fJnqRmoHhm7ozKMS88YVFwneHJUEtTkXRHa7tM2tN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc9zSBf3MUMML3MCx2G3MyxVeYv2QoBNiaXzDPDqnmuLB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NvmhEqecNG6qw53cNrBBtgAJAom4Haf7k"], "tags": ["tokyo", "street", "graffiti", "photography"], "extra": {}}
