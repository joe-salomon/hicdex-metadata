Fortunately, it was extinguished quickly and the only victim survived and now she is in the hospital, only the smell reached our apartment.

Why didn't I take a photo camera, for example?\n\nToday I looked at the birds for a very long time, I had the last frame in the cassette, which I could not use for several days.
