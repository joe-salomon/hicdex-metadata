This struck me as incredibly meta - how likely was it that this was the only time I've ever shattered a screen, and it happened at the end of a mini-game inside of a game where you get to play God? Are we all just Miis inside God's 3DS? I had to take a pic.\n\nCierra Maher | @CierraShares\n1800px x 1349px\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdHiVxMYiHJyxh8u1vLB7rzXanP88xrmEDtwBsjvuvzt7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcH67EMrGstMN77jEeFPjLWV2Rdfr2F434wiTVe9asiWm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdHiVxMYiHJyxh8u1vLB7rzXanP88xrmEDtwBsjvuvzt7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XduX9RUaE6TpiviVogP4rTxTBpGuqvgjR"], "tags": ["GameOver", "game", "pixel", "damaged", "cracked", "8bit", "pixelart", "3DS", "DS", "Tomodachi", "TomodachiLife", "Nintendo", "meta", "metamoment", "theend", "RPG", "Quest"], "extra": {}}
