Thus brings us to this work. One of the things I have learned from my time on a First Nation reservation is when you're trying to watch something move in the distance in the forest, you have learn to ignore the trees and see right through them. I suppose this could be a metaphor for meeting or talking to people. You have to learn to ignore the incredibly dense ego forest you're looking at and see inside to the actions of the person. As the old saying goes, \"Actions speak louder than words.\" None of us are born wise. Some of us pick up wisdom here and there. Some of us learn early. Some of us learn late. Some of us never learn. When you do have this wisdom, what do you do with it? Obviously, you use it in your own life, but great wisdom needs to be shared so that others can learn from them as well. Wisdom that is hoarded, is lost; it needs to be shared.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZqyyZDd7m7d51UftdKtVagrmxHtBAcgZPnC26bxMjN7T", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRS8zsCHj1PzjeginVCcLsxFVFDminEwNvtCpcrSLBX4N", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZqyyZDd7m7d51UftdKtVagrmxHtBAcgZPnC26bxMjN7T", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
