{"__version": 1, "token_id": 635102, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Colorful Space Traveler #001", "description": "During takeoff and re-entry space travelers can experience several times normal gravity. An untrained person can usually withstand about 3g, but can black out at 4 to 6g. G-force in the vertical direction is more difficult to tolerate than a force perpendicular to the spine because blood flows away from the brain and eyes. First the person experiences a temporary loss of vision and then at higher g-forces loses consciousness. G-force training and a G-suit which constricts the body to keep more blood in the head can mitigate the effects.\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbho6tQF1XPWx4jpuntkVoZV1W9dLpW8Gp5DAX6uiuQDv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaUqtfXAG4B6t8otYzDLVQZHzWKa2HFYNm4Y9wH9nDnu4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmQKZRDxbdDzNcBMWoYcTf4E4GwnxSq7YSYWN1ysHXFojZ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbho6tQF1XPWx4jpuntkVoZV1W9dLpW8Gp5DAX6uiuQDv", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RRX8VXmeAXTx2erqqX6vxewN2ss5xWSVs"], "tags": ["space", "eyes", "look", "vision", "math", "formula", "beauty", "animated", "graph"], "extra": {}}
