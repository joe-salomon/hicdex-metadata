The images of this collection are elaborated by compacting components of space, time and intention. The algorithm generate images by crushing cinematographic works. The generated image, a residual trace of time, synthesizes in a colorful atmosphere the history of the original movie. The process, like the mining of some crypto assets, need a long time of computer calculation and it's value can also be indexed on electrical energy.\n\nThis image is the residual trace of the movie \"Star Wars, A New Hope\" by George Lucas in 1977.\n\nImage properties: 6000x2513px, 150dpi, .png, printable\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZgwenwFPenjoTBKnnJgdFNrr8pomubM2BY4VdrNZNK7W", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSWnZPd7QAj4cuqieVcoRe7AV3xxUpgniyQJQJGNhodMb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZgwenwFPenjoTBKnnJgdFNrr8pomubM2BY4VdrNZNK7W", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SzTsJNtuHjitQqchKko1n18o3NBVnCpGk"], "tags": ["image", "color", "remix", "algorithm", "abstract", "movie", "generate"], "extra": {}}
