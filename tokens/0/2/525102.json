Back then, western music albums weren\u2019t officially licensed locally. So the only way you could listen to foreign albums were either by getting it straight from abroad (which is expensive), or buy the \u201cofficial\u201d bootleg version that was available at your friendly local cassette stores. Naturally, most people opted for the second option. My father had a HUGE collection of these bootleg tapes. Although I found out later that bootlegging is illegal, those tapes had a major influence on my musical experience. They introduced me to some of the classic albums that I love to this day.\n\n\u201cSenjata Pemuas Massal\u201d is currently my most well known song. It was my first song that ever get the music video treatment, and I guess that\u2019s what make it so popular. To this day, I could never walked off from a live stage without performing it. I tried that once, and the audience just wouldn\u2019t let me end my set unless I play that stupid song. I told \u2018em that since they want it then I\u2019ll  play it, but they\u2019d have to sing it themselves. And they did, from start to finish! It was great.\n\nYESS had a very distinctive look on their tapes. Even if you only had a short look from the side, you\u2019d know you\u2019ve seen a YESS tape when you see it. These dudes have exquisite taste in their music. They specifically released jazz, classic and progressive rock albums that only serious musicians are super-into. Of course my dad had a whole bunch of these things, cause I just happened to be a loser son of a very talented 70\u2019s musician.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeZMfev1XVRK3tWkmfPUV5bZiMjo2S3tb71Q2QVehbmhY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRCnrEee8f2KaSKFFbdK7KZ3icLgvZHkQ5TbrR92pXMFm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeZMfev1XVRK3tWkmfPUV5bZiMjo2S3tb71Q2QVehbmhY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T9f1P4JAJ2sqh4QQMut65btmk6oMm3Jys"], "tags": ["YESS", "tape", "bootleg", "late90's", "70's", "80's", "indonesiancassettesera", "krowbar", "sabdarajadosa", ""], "extra": {}}
