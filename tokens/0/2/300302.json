Lisle)", "description": "Bouguereau's girl is inspired paint from  William Bouguereau style.\n\nSometimes the detail is not necessary to capture the essence, the essence is that ephemeral aura that surrounds a person. That which we cannot see, but there it is, that which makes us stop in front of a painting and wish to meet that girl behind it.\nAsk us if her hair is kinky when she get up, or if her gaze closes when she smile or her eyes open more.\n\nPainting has the wonderful quality of giving us more than what we perceive with the eyes, because behind each brushstroke there is throbbing emotion.\n\nAs the little prince said. The essential is invisible to the eyes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeicyzslknyzx3r7gp7wrjhpwte732csxx5i2torszuehm7f2rj4yb4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreienhwqe5cschmbbffzqp22wrzs7r2blkgzh7s3hf5jz3cdmxkh2kq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeicyzslknyzx3r7gp7wrjhpwte732csxx5i2torszuehm7f2rj4yb4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZryT4fmy97uV39Vq8VbSNmtqstUgLXiTq"], "tags": ["illustration", "traditional", "acrylic", "2DArt", "oldtimes", "oleo", "watercolour", "drawing", "art", "objkt4objkt"], "extra": {}}
