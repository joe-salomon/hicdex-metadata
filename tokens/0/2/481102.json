After several attempts I landed on this one, and then I felt a single eye alone wouldn\u2019t cut it. So constructed a contrasting flower pattern using the eye drawing as petals - scary but beautiful at the same time. Although opinions may differ, as a result my Flower of Eyes 1 was born.\n\nI decided to process the first image even further and stuck with an orangesque halloween colour to the piece, after experimenting with more digital filters - Flower of Eyes 2 was, I think, a nice contrasting result from the first piece.\n\nHappy Halloween everyone.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQnNEkSkaEnBoF2jeL1mkgMZJVu3ApN9ruvr2mcggUro", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaFUH4thXxtmMnsPWVGiVZP6tLApmVf2TptVTnzyXGECE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQnNEkSkaEnBoF2jeL1mkgMZJVu3ApN9ruvr2mcggUro", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hMpzadgcgpUiDf5N6YXzMmDryWHKkaPuy"], "tags": ["Halloween", "Abstract", "Flower"], "extra": {}}
