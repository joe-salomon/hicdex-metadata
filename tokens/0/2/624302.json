The god also furthers prosperity and is worshiped particularly by merchants and tradesmen, is the patron deity of swordsmiths and is associated with brothels and entertainers.\n\nIn Shint\u014d legends Inari is identified with Uka no Mitama no Kami (\u201cAugust Spirit of Food\u201d), son of the impetuous storm god, Susanoo. The rice god is also associated in some Shint\u014d shrines with the goddess of food, Ukemochi no Kami; and there is considerable variation in the way in which Inari is depicted, as a bearded man riding a white fox or as a woman with long, flowing hair, carrying sheaves of rice.\n\nLooping MP4\n1920 x 1920\n25 Fps", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNZ28uAFwHTBfurDehUakhQ5rm2JAW3VUu256mfHycSmG", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf41dhWjSKMnbqEUqS51hTxcjpA1UrTS7sTkkWwj5LDtC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNZ28uAFwHTBfurDehUakhQ5rm2JAW3VUu256mfHycSmG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz28e6H5kgpZhcJ6siqt7Mt6UkWX2FtEgskZ"], "tags": ["inari", "fox", "winter", "japanese", "snow", "whitefox", "illustrator", "animation", "ndroytz"], "extra": {}}
