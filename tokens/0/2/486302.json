{"__version": 1, "token_id": 486302, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Omphalotus Illudens \"Jack-O'-Lantern\"", "description": "@cryptomushii\n\nOften called the \"Jack O'Lantern Mushroom,\" this species is fairly easy to identify. It grows in clusters on wood, its colors are bright orange, its gills run down the stem, it has a white to pale yellow spore print, and its flesh, when sliced open, is orange (or at least orangish).\n\nThe Jack O'Lantern mushroom is sometimes confused with chanterelles--especially when it appears to be growing terrestrially rather than from wood (see the top illustration). However, chanterelles rarely grow in dense clusters, and feature false gills, while the Jack O'Lantern is usually clustered and features true gills.\n\nAlthough O. illudens looks attractive and smells pleasant, do not eat it! The Jack-O-Lantern contains the toxin muscarine and causes a variety of unpleasant symptoms. Most people will experience severe abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYzSfvX6VMBkj8okYpi4JNMetdaC8pLEwcNtSc1isYPYq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYzSfvX6VMBkj8okYpi4JNMetdaC8pLEwcNtSc1isYPYq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYzSfvX6VMBkj8okYpi4JNMetdaC8pLEwcNtSc1isYPYq", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ULMhEp7tyRaxcRj7fCFYT13pPFgELeCWS"], "tags": ["cryptomushii", "mushiis", "mushrooms", "fungi", "pixel", "gif"], "extra": {}}
