Then I crashed and burned. I exhausted mindbodyspirit. ___ I subsequently embarked in a years-long journey of meditation and healing to realign the soul. ___ One mantra I would continue to come across, as a course-correction to an overactive mind, is to \u201cjust sit.\u201d To sit the body, which subsequently allows the mind to sit.  No need to visualize things, no need to learn a new philosophy or life hack, no need to distract the mind with more contents. Just sit. And sit. And sit some more. Here I found rest. ___ Today this meditation-via-words continues to stand as a simple powerful practice to cut through the overactive mind on a moment-by-moment-by-moment basis. ___ As soon as I notice the mind run away from me\u2026JUST SIT. Meaning just allow the mind to sit and settle. ___ I continue to write down this mantra in many places as a regular reminder. Such is the intention with this NFT. I wish it brings you the same value. <3", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaw8HTZCacEdWn6wp2MmsgXUvbG6rGSum1zCkGW6aoxJj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPQeqHyr4fv5Yytfu3D5BaVJgAaLNro6W7g7AMyunthJK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaw8HTZCacEdWn6wp2MmsgXUvbG6rGSum1zCkGW6aoxJj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LBayeDsbbgDu7euVnKB8WywgNGkemvZiV"], "tags": ["calligraphy", "handwriting", "penmanship", "lettering", "typography", "minimalist", "meditation", "yoga", "zen", "mantra"], "extra": {}}
