Noise is taken from circular motion on a 2D noise field with its own radius and offset. These values are mapped onto a range of colours according to one of seven different algorithms, and rotation is added to produce interference patterns with a choice from eight rendering modes.\nThe initial seed for this loop of 180 frames is 790902, which selects function 3 with offset (23.0, -39.0), range (6.0, -3.0), and function 2 with offset (-52.0, 49.0), range (-2.0, -4.0). Noise is produced from sampling points on an ellipse at co-ordinates (-49.0, 15.0) with diameters (5.0, 2.0). The three formulae are combined using algorithm 5 with hue values starting at 290 with range 106. The grid is 172 units square.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV6ubKQbWD3BBTrmX9FtocyGVeCHSCi2jgJKGm6TbkUiC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV6ubKQbWD3BBTrmX9FtocyGVeCHSCi2jgJKGm6TbkUiC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV6ubKQbWD3BBTrmX9FtocyGVeCHSCi2jgJKGm6TbkUiC", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VjCS2jiBTVPSEoYzJ79KkbYV5QbFJxuf3"], "tags": ["xisal", "noise", "loop", "processing", "grid", "790902"], "extra": {}}
