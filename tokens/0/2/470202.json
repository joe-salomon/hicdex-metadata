{"__version": 1, "token_id": 470202, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Transmission", "description": "This OBJKT uses the GPU and requires webgl2 (GLSL ES 3.0). Tested in Chrome. Fullscreen viewing is recommended.\n\nThis shader animation is often highly self-similar and the full viewing lasts somewhere between 50 and 60 days. It should not repeat a frame in that period. In the end the display eventually becomes a single line of noisy pixels which finally disappears leaving only darkness behind.\n\nAll pixels are computed from a single function of x, y and time. A few pixels may come out as \"glitchy\", this is partly due to the complexity of the function and my laziness but I also believe perfect filtering would dampen the analog tube noise image effect, which is desired here.\n\nI hope you enjoy the transmission.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR8Ki6uMQ13ubgnQ6hjNeXfWehMWRuR3SRHXBr5LZ9Z47", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWUJLkz78sbm4m1zzZHKpopsCP8RUvF6JJ9h4ysCvQH5d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR8Ki6uMQ13ubgnQ6hjNeXfWehMWRuR3SRHXBr5LZ9Z47", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1KhAVDecQBh9BZLnN1dUynovHjaNUbNF5d"], "tags": ["shader", "gpu", "maths", "art", "video", "animation", ""], "extra": {}}
