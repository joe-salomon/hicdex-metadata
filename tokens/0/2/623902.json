Records in the US. The album has influenced many bands and musicians, and the industry in general. In particular, the album's raw energy, and Johnny Rotten's sneering delivery and \"half-singing\", are often considered game-changing. It is frequently listed as the most influential punk album, and one of the most important and best albums of all time.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNXEURDXcTcmKcYoRUPf91ui9ZbwfFz7BzC3kZX6pQz4J", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmat1RDrpwnCxs2MzxstRCQnwJtj12HQz3dVqnsUDzs8xS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNXEURDXcTcmKcYoRUPf91ui9ZbwfFz7BzC3kZX6pQz4J", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i9Jbej7sM2TvtpZ9YrJr8wUtpZ91BQ6vf"], "tags": ["digitalart", "pixelart", "8bit", "sexpistols", "album", "cover", "punkrock"], "extra": {}}
