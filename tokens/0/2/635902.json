I started this project up to combat my depression and anxiety. It has helped keep me motivated, to get up, and go out. The majority of all the images you see here are quickly captured with not much hesitation. I hope you enjoy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWMVX8JRQ6REgJebBoCJ4Dzyu4v4oSmcMLwPU1gWuJXEr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWLjsbvLYX3hj6GFiyJijdvQYqcVv7zdUNUwr3mabBdD8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWMVX8JRQ6REgJebBoCJ4Dzyu4v4oSmcMLwPU1gWuJXEr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lwbh32t3MjGQPMvfpu4PCmXFLT5FKct6B"], "tags": ["Taiwan", "Asia", "Kaohsiung", "StreetPhotography", "Photography", "Photograph", "Photos", "Elderly", "People"], "extra": {}}
