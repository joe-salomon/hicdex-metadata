When your mind is wired a certain way, after awhile (if you're wise) you stop asking why and just accept it. Just accept yourself the way you are. Stop worrying about what other people might say or what they might be thinking. Life is way too short to give a hoot. If you spend your time thinking about what other people are saying, you're literally wasting your life away. Wait, how did this page turn into a Jay Shetty inspirational speech. lol", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd6S1Gwitk82PdtPRAoMJ8fZxaT4LTz5Nn3X7Ttx2evjE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVccRAcu8v3vPgfZmJUE3hjie1VhTAvD6bZ8Lj55VJfxk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd6S1Gwitk82PdtPRAoMJ8fZxaT4LTz5Nn3X7Ttx2evjE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
