The objective of this type of photograph is to obtain a record visual of unique pieces involved in the construction of a book. As Roger Chartier says: a writer doesn't make books, he just writes them. \nWe keep an eye on this process by collecting, not only \"analog\"-printed books, but also taking them as a source for art experimentation.\nThe picture is an 2048x4608 JPG, captured with a humble Nikon D3100, 18-55 lens in Van Hutten Libros, 6th may of 2021 in C\u00f3rdoba - Argentina.\n\nAlso the book can be buyed in our ig@vanhuttenlibros\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTo2bHe7uPjwEGibKTYiZYwfPfSoPHKRYviKuZpkXEpWN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZRkyHAFfhVQMY3CgzU1xcK6qUChgjGZmi8CoJte41a7h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTo2bHe7uPjwEGibKTYiZYwfPfSoPHKRYviKuZpkXEpWN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QpiSQSuqTdZpXTNDrA9N8BBiPhHCzyqLZ"], "tags": ["books", "antiquebooks", "publishing", "printing", "Aguilar", "secondhandbooks", "uniquebooks"], "extra": {}}
