{"__version": 1, "token_id": 600662, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "#01_GOD_ANUBIS", "description": "Anubis or Inpu, Anpu in Ancient Egyptian (Ancient Greek: \u1f0c\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03b9\u03c2, Egyptian: inpw, Coptic: \u2c81\u2c9b\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2ca1 Anoup) is the Greek name of the god of death, mummification, embalming, the afterlife, cemeteries, tombs, and the Underworld, in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head. Archeologists have identified Anubis's sacred animal as an Egyptian canid, the African golden wolf. The African wolf was formerly called the \"African golden jackal\", until a 2015 genetic analysis updated the taxonomy and the common name for the species. As a result, Anubis is often referred to as having a \"jackal\" head, but this \"jackal\" is now more properly called a \"wolf\".", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW5JkWgshDUDDrg5Z7pFXqC63BDXM1hbXBb9QQ2BQzhFP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW5JkWgshDUDDrg5Z7pFXqC63BDXM1hbXBb9QQ2BQzhFP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW5JkWgshDUDDrg5Z7pFXqC63BDXM1hbXBb9QQ2BQzhFP", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1gGMbvMSmVJmCqpYLjTXom2okbP1qZ5UJG"], "tags": ["pixel"], "extra": {}}
