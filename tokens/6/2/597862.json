{"__version": 1, "token_id": 597862, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "I DREW WIRED WEIRD", "description": "I suppose this is going to be the closest thing to a self-portrait besides the HOPELESS SEMANTIC work from earlier in this epic saga of color, space and time. We could start to understand the work by creating a narrative by stating: I, DREW, am WIRED WEIRD. Having the unique ability to see deep within the depths of a language and formulate a vast collection of seemingly useless words, phrase, sentences, etc. on gradient backgrounds can appear to be a lone place to find oneself. Conversations aren't the easiest for me as my mind is constantly creating at almost every moment conscious. I know that I'm wired differently from just about everyone in the world and that's great! To any young people and people with Asperger's reading this book, if you've gotten this far, you have the patience of a saint. Your talents in whatever you do are amazing. Do not let anyone take your power, your passion away from you. Do not let cyber bullying and/or internet trolls derail your vision. Ok, enough pep talk..we're about 55% through and 45% to go!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU1FkNVRzuRR39jPQVs3kQMNsJDxRg2pgRQwxDnwXmnLs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW5bXhCLkcfNTSg27E6nwyBFyFmrPNErM5GPYHgTqbyny", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU1FkNVRzuRR39jPQVs3kQMNsJDxRg2pgRQwxDnwXmnLs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
