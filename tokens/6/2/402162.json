{"__version": 1, "token_id": 402162, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Fire Flora #25", "description": "I am an Australian artist inspired by the natural world. Working across the disciplines of painting and digital media, I make art with fire itself, using my work as a vehicle to raise awareness about the ecological perils facing the planet. The images in this collection were made in the wake of the 2019/20 Australian bushfires. I burnt a series of painted timber panels with a blow torch and pyrography equipment, photographed the work and then composited the images in Photoshop. Ghostly, computer-generated floral motives float above a charred and abraded landscape, foreshadowing the disappearance of human civilization on Earth.
