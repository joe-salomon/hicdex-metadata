We're going to do something fun and off script. I want you to remember that moment right now. No, seriously...stop reading this. Put down your phone, book, etc and remember that moment. I'll be here waiting.............................Now, do you remember the last time you kissed them? Was it 5 seconds, 5 minutes, 5 hours, 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 years, or 5 decades? Whatever the answer is, give them a kiss; they need it; you need it; we all need it. This world needs more love, more compassion, more open hearts, more understanding. Be part of that movement. As one of my favorite artists, Benny Cruz (@BennyCruz) said, \"Kind is the new beautiful.\" He's 100% correct. Being kind can change lives and thus change entire communities. It takes a village, to be an actual village and just some place that you live in. Be the change you seek.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTJZezwBFfwr4axbTtcV6SYT6LVrroiUJ3oVtrzKBimxD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbPkiXQNAaugPAFDwmkxnBt7umr9Umh6U5SRa1CtmiNSq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTJZezwBFfwr4axbTtcV6SYT6LVrroiUJ3oVtrzKBimxD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
