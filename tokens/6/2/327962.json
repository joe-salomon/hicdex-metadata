The result was the MSN-04 Sazabi, which was later built by the Luna-based contractor Anaheim Electronics. With an overall height of 25.6 meters, the Sazabi is much bigger than most standard mobile suits, but thanks to the use of lightweight armor materials and a great number of thrusters it is much faster and maneuverable than other suits. The suit is armed with an abdomen-mounted scattering mega particle cannon, a beam shot rifle, a pair of beam sabers stored in the arms and a shield with three missiles as well as a beam tomahawk.\n\n\ndigital illustration art \n5906 x 7200\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeicZwth98H9mJFvWkK7kX2edEoHxydugUGqMiCv5ZW5G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTeYiREHCE8x2KzKUKWUQw1Bs8UxBXZj6QqEZ39cMMH1Q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeicZwth98H9mJFvWkK7kX2edEoHxydugUGqMiCv5ZW5G", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1czz3xPUBtAvLSG4deWJVeavosHAvUvU8v"], "tags": ["character", "japan", "scientific", "science", "illustration", "msn-04", "80s", "neon", "vector", "mecha", "robot", "art", "gundam", "nftcommunity", "yuasabda", "games", "hicetnunc", "nftart", "illustration", "scif-i", "spoozy", "artwork"], "extra": {}}
