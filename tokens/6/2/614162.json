I can't help but imagine that even if he came back from the dead as a walking corpse that he would still be rocking his wig and looking as stylish as always\n\nZombie Warhol Gold Frames will initially be limited at 50 copies. First 20 sales will include an Agent Go Purple Frame sent to your wallet free of charge. After 24 hours of initial sale going public, the remaining editions will be burned.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWA7xfHpnwKmt1W4x2YBuWJAw92MyEPb9yRZrPSZxJpJr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPiA2Vdsf91trxP4pn3tyUYofHjSVy2XWu11uM3RhhmbV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWA7xfHpnwKmt1W4x2YBuWJAw92MyEPb9yRZrPSZxJpJr", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["AndyWarhol", "Art", "Artist", "Popart", "Warhol", "Zombie", "Undead", "Undeadart", "Zombieart", "horror", "goofy", "stylish", ""], "extra": {}}
