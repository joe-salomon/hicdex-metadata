Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts, and the eagle the king of the birds, by the Middle Ages, the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature. Since classical antiquity, griffins were known for guarding treasures and priceless possessions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXfThGidz9wLRwbjz9A52qcgQfsXqEZXwmZ8FXhDikcmz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdPJ3iDCxQ7qBMxAhbrJVYX28R49f5pSibCAkfMneB1gd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXfThGidz9wLRwbjz9A52qcgQfsXqEZXwmZ8FXhDikcmz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UMC9eDk8rPcE6koq9VDNcwU1V4AFTNibB"], "tags": ["griffin", "griffon", "gryphon", "fantasy", "mythology", "lion", "eagle", "illustration", "greek", "ancient", "wings", "vintage", "majestic", "king", "royal", "antique", "phoenix", "myth", "dragon", "mythical", "tiger", "predator", "lowpoly", "monster", "claw", "legendary", "geometric", "pegasus", "guard", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
