That day, several years ago, we had a beautiful conversation about how open mics bring us all together, what makes a good open mic, how to cultivate our pain and joy into something concrete in a room.\n\nAs a host and event producer myself, it was cool to be tasked with capturing this concept. I stepped outside of myself to draft this story 4 years ago, and I dove in to deliver this first ever studio interpretation of a time that seems so distant, yet transformed by the circumstances of this pandemic. I long for live music and fellowship. If I were at my favorite open mic, we might create a house band that sounds like this.
