And the soul inside her soft Cumbia music spoke right to people's hearts. \nThe day of her tragic death, crowds gathered spontaneously on Ruta de la Muerte and created an altar in her name. It keeps receiving offerings 25 years later.\n\nGilda is a Saint of the People: her printed presence brings miracles to life.\nHolding Gilda close to your heart attracts prosperity and unconditional love.\n\n\n\ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude38\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude09 (@\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude38\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23_12) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeyzTXPsExasLRGw37fP7FfjhDRPyu2miLMi9ieoGxP2L", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbA5H9X9Rq3uTDcHuEW6ZNKKU4Nn8jCxUQQMiHPdA6Y3T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeyzTXPsExasLRGw37fP7FfjhDRPyu2miLMi9ieoGxP2L", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
