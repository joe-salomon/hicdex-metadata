At other times, it just looks awfully messy.\n///\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeuEKkXZkuSRgtjCo3StR7rMb479Bucct1XFVGpsMMikj", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb13ZNMi5JNDw5Nv8rb1iwLgMUXBq4jRHP6tG8UT5NbZH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeuEKkXZkuSRgtjCo3StR7rMb479Bucct1XFVGpsMMikj", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1WZuFdbESHfBSvoBeao1Wkt7NCyUuXAT9D"], "tags": ["p5js", "glsl", "webgl", "interactive", "creativecoding", "codeart"], "extra": {}}
