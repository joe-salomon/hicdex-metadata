The Portfolio Center drew me to Atlanta, I lived there for 10 years and now finding myself in Louisville, KY seems like the most unlikely of places to settle down. This is where my wife grew up, starting a family is what brought us back... and now my entire immediate family lives here so I couldn't be happier. But again, you look back at your life and if you TRIED to see today, 15 years ago, I would have never seen myself here... but NOW, I wouldn't change a thing. Life takes twists and turns and if we attempted to steer the ship somehow could we ever have even guided things to contentment? I'm not sure.
