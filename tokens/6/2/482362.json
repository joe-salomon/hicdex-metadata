Yet especially organically grown, fresh cucumbers  can be particularily prickly, before the thorns fall off after a while.\nIt's inspired by my first weeks working in my vegetable garden, where, after having lived my whole life in the city, I discovered how prickly and thorny cucumbers can be. This somewhat comical scenario is based upon my personal experience while trying to harvest those little prickly beats, while getting entangled and stung.\nThis work is painted digitally in high resolution and printable.
