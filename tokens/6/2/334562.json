This planet was discovered by Nasa 12 Years ago in 2035. It is 18 Light Years away and is 3.1x bigger than Earth. 83% of its surface is covered in Liquid Sulphur so Scientists are expecting Aquatic Life. This planet revolves around a white Dwarf, The closest and only white Dwarf in our galaxy. It also have probably the biggest Storms in our Galaxy, 3 Times bigger than the Jupiter's Great white spot. Though Scientists could not identify the reason of its pink atmosphere yet. This mission maybe will be the biggest step towards Interplanetary travel and finding alien life.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNgEsZhUxqR8cWrAYF7K1uubTpdthkQM7QJjZqEXhsP4f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmchQmRiLZtW28gcEF4fZJH7SYGw2WYibwrSSKgX198e7V", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNgEsZhUxqR8cWrAYF7K1uubTpdthkQM7QJjZqEXhsP4f", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eEQeJ292QHcmw7atwQRGUsdz3VLzuDXVk"], "tags": ["Space", "SciFi", "Alien", "Planet"], "extra": {}}
