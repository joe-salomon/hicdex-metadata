They have colourful skin and wear pants made from tiger skin. They appear in a wide variety of Japanese folklore, kids songs and festivals, sometimes as a bad goblin and sometimes as a god-like good creature.\nThe famous image of Oni is that they are living in hell, working for Yemma who is the god who judges the people, and Oni punishes them.\nAs for tattoos, you might have seen a Hannya mask, which is also a type of Oni but Hannya is originally a lady and became Hannya because of anger and jealousy.
