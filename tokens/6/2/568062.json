Every night, the lighthouse keeper would climb these stairs to illuminate the lamp, and help ships to safely navigate their way along the coast. This lighthouse, near San Diego, CA, was decommissioned in 1891, but has remained a popular sightseeing destination, and is now part of the Cabrillo National Monument.\n\nThe 2nd piece in my \"Maritime\" series, taking a brief look at the structures we humans build to interact with the sea, whether from dry land, at water's edge, or on the open ocean.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmacYWtAVMb8WDMh7eBwEgZgigueWwa5AjrAfyawdu7N8z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY8J7bKwxQQmxBkuJqRTQbKPxgsEZH9jK6i2dCVJExG47", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmacYWtAVMb8WDMh7eBwEgZgigueWwa5AjrAfyawdu7N8z", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29ZRzr7Le6QHCpj3WwH67bEBZhfb1edpEo"], "tags": ["stairs", "spiral", "lighthouse", "ocean", "digital", "photography", "loma", "california"], "extra": {}}
