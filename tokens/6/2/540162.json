But it's minted in the context of current development. \n\nThe animation / GIF illustrates that entities of a system (art environment for instance) interact in a dynamic way, but of course the illustration is not correct or sufficient. So it's not explaining facts, but showing that a system evolves based on various inter-dependencies, interactions etc. It's no illustration of autopietic concepts and a very minimal design (even the mechanics are super limited here), but it might help to trigger thoughts on systems we would like to create. \n\nWhat is the role of a creator, what is the role of a collector? How are traditional systems impacted if persons act as artists and collectors? How could we optimize environments in a sustainable way, so that (in this case) a positive cultural impact can be achieved? Many discussions are still needed for the future of art and this little GIF is not making a statement at all. \n\nCredits: https://ncase.me/loopy/v1.1/    ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfXimXDonEZuB4tdxoRU72TohX8165h6TbCCfeoTo1Fnm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfXimXDonEZuB4tdxoRU72TohX8165h6TbCCfeoTo1Fnm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfXimXDonEZuB4tdxoRU72TohX8165h6TbCCfeoTo1Fnm", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Ta4wUo4G3phRSvnmyVZw6xPo8zteUwDyV"], "tags": ["loopy", "system", "art", "fun", "GIF"], "extra": {}}
