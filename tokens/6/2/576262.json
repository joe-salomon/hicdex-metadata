{"__version": 1, "token_id": 576262, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Jack", "description": "This is Jack.\nHe was a rescue street cat, belonged to my friend Natalia. She is a very special friend for me and I love Jack, he was a very good boy.\nJack first came into Natalia's life being very sick from FeLV. Left at her front door. She was able at that time to help him heal and decided to keep him. She has a story of rescuing animals and helping in related causes, Jack is not an only child.\n\nRecently, Jack started to get very sick very quickly, he had kidney stones and was getting worse, she was moving Hells to help him. The vet bills started raising and where already reaching 1600 reais (Brazilian coin) and keeping up with the treatment was added to that.\n\nI was in similar situations before, so I know how hard it can be and how not being able to do something sucks. I wanted to help, so I created this painting.\nUnfortunately, last night when I was finishing this artwork I received the news that he had passed away... I'm very sorry I couldn't help then sooner.\n\n Although he didn't survive the bill still has to be paid. I still want to help this friend going through this delicate situation.\nWe need to getter about 66 XTZ to pay the bills.\n\nIf you want to help or is just a collector interested in cat pieces you are welcome to purchase one. We are immensely grateful.\n\nThank You \n\nfrom me, Natalia and Jack.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR8MVf9EseebcjZeSBAXBSxhsDUjrCkKUx2YFrQM5phJU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQXSfFm9MKxoukap34DwhJ1VLEv8qMqbnxq43drFg2VCo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR8MVf9EseebcjZeSBAXBSxhsDUjrCkKUx2YFrQM5phJU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QJSNDRTqpwP8NUBBjijSReAbo1qr5Kc6r"], "tags": ["cat", "digitalpainting", "painting", "space", "cosmic"], "extra": {}}
