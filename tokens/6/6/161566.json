During this era of civil unrest and anti-war protests in Austin, the Ku Klux Klan received permission to march in a pro-Vietnam war demonstration. They were received by a largely peaceful but quite vocal opposing group of citizens and students during this moment in history. This photo shows another close-up look at one of the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan in the Texas area as they proceed with their march. Taken with a Praktica FX2 camera on 35mm Kodachrome film.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZCy8durFDgLrbECr6AEaSUVV3d7fYg6yvM2VdZqca1zh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQA5CdAuk17UqnQGuBbZLKYC4yFEQgTdk1sMf23B4BBWz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZCy8durFDgLrbECr6AEaSUVV3d7fYg6yvM2VdZqca1zh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YmwJZfEerVMbc8uuJc7xUzE64ma3Xfu7L"], "tags": ["KKK", "Klan", "Clan", "history", "protest", "Vietnam", "Austin", "Texas", "series", "peace", "60\u2019s", "civilrights", "anti-war", "city", "1965", "march", "black", "lives", "matter", "blm", "white", "supremacy", "security", ""], "extra": {}}
