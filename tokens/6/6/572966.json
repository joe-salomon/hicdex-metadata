One of the more traditional symbols I feature heavily is the snake because they can represent danger, sin, or temptation. On the other hand, I also love painting fur rugs a lot because they look cool but also because they represent decadence and a sort of cruelty to me.\nAcrylic and acrylic gauche on wood panel\n16 \u00d7 16 in\n40.6 \u00d7 40.6 cm\nDate : 2017", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPKXy2UxJM8t995vr1viKLUrYEYEMaaE96tLWpkMjYiXq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZfiSn11SL2cSiJQaqtVfb5fbYa7LHTAjYjiLy3rPtCim", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmPKXy2UxJM8t995vr1viKLUrYEYEMaaE96tLWpkMjYiXq"}], "creators": ["tz1gsTBHe2x7xTnQNCnBGqpCcZoWefxFaBTz"], "tags": ["art", "painting", "nude", "nudeart", "psychedelic", "illustration", "drawing", "psychedelicart"], "extra": {}}
