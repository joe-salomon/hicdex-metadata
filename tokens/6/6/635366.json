These wheels or disks of spinning energy each correspond to certain nerve bundles and major organs. \n\nEach energy point acts as a wheel, spinning and vibrating with energy. The higher the frequency of vibration, the more in balance your chakras will be.\n\nRoot chakra (Red)\nThe root chakra, or Muladhara, is located at the base of your spine. It provides you with a base or foundation for life, and it helps you feel grounded and able to withstand challenges. Your root chakra is responsible for your sense of security and stability.\n\nSacral chakra(Orange)\nThe sacral chakra, or Svadhisthana, is located just below your belly button. This chakra is responsible for your sexual and creative energy. It\u2019s also linked to how you relate to your emotions as well as the emotions of others.\n\nSolar plexus chakra(Yellow)\nThe solar plexus chakra, or Manipura, is located in your stomach area. It\u2019s responsible for confidence and self-esteem, as well as helping you feel in control of your life.\n\nHeart chakra(Green)\nThe heart chakra, or Anahata, is located near your heart, in the center of your chest.

This chakra has to do with our ability to communicate verbally.\n\nThird eye chakra(Indigo)\nThe third eye chakra, or Ajna, is located between your eyes.
