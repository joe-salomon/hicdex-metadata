{"__version": 1, "token_id": 326266, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Red union 8", "description": "This series of works I dedicate to color. Red is a sense of strength and greatness. All the pictures show women in the best versions of themselves. The woman, like the red color for me, conveys sexuality, beauty and power. And the crimson color goes hand in hand with the woman. Every job has its meaning, but I suggest you find something in common in each peace.\n\nHow many doors a woman can open in her life? In the 18th century \u2013 not more than two, in 21 \u2013 more than 100, but do they end there? And I\u2019m certainly talking about doors as a metaphor for female growth. Even living in the modern world, women are still being tamed and prevented from showing their ambitions. So my series of works named \u00abRed union\u00bb I want to close with the words: we can do anything! All the previous seven stories were aimed at convincing women once again of their uniqueness and impeccability, and showing men that this is normal and beautiful. Stop being afraid of yourself and your abilities! Love! Talk! Amaze! Thank you for you girls!!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWwZJcf81NwDubNgA86EvtQe3ruqVXDb7dYNYX2JbMSTL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNcC7wcwdKTKR2qYmf2PRk4CNzcQDf4esivyxSuWyi343", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWwZJcf81NwDubNgA86EvtQe3ruqVXDb7dYNYX2JbMSTL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["redunion", "women", "femalegrowth"], "extra": {}}
