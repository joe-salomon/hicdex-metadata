I was on a deadline filming with Bruno Passos for one of my video parts. I wanted to add a backyard pool feel so I got a pool ladder to add to the mix. Lance Mountain has always been an inspiration to me and his pool ladder antics got me thinking. After skating around a bit I thought about this trick and a few tries later I got to nose grind after hippie jumping the ladder. A raw clip golden moment doing what I love.
