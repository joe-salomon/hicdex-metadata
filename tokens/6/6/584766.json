These vary in species (some have wings like a bird, while others have wings like a bat). The species of wing does not interchange between breed of Winged Wolf. Bird-winged wolves of a pure line do not give birth to a bat-winged wolf, nor does a bat-winged wolf of a pure line give birth to a bird-winged wolf. They can only occur in mixed litters if their parents (or ancestors are mixed lineage).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdqTpieNEVrZaGkcys8EPf6R99kBjHkKbU4UjEmEEA79N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSY39nPPjMVuFbJu45pBPYTCWSHDMyXeTcnhz6ARKH2LX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdqTpieNEVrZaGkcys8EPf6R99kBjHkKbU4UjEmEEA79N", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2HDxJDbzZwEpyVQZXK1CFWijARxNAGLF5C"], "tags": ["Nftcommunity", "Nftart", "nftcollector", ""], "extra": {}}
