After only a few session, pandemic quarantine started and it's been just me and the cats. Stella is hanging with me in this meta/self-portrait, as the drawingroom has become subject rather than a gathering spot; however, I'm pleased to share it with you and I hope that it will continue to be be a catalyst for creativity and inspiration. I have more drawings and some music created in the drawingroom that I'm excited to share with you. \n\nAs they say, \"The first one's free.\" ;)\n\n~Joel", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX5yrhrfiDNc9QsDPJhVJDHAW9uCFn4GU4vRYrkWyEwXx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPoU5prJsFUu6Z2WRzPFzjiJtv1AdnePEMVHsfKqwdrTp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX5yrhrfiDNc9QsDPJhVJDHAW9uCFn4GU4vRYrkWyEwXx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1h6APuQ2yHWfmG6RfE8mvEdXpFbLKtvMLt"], "tags": ["artdamaged", "artdamgedrecords", "drawingroom", "drawingroomsessions", "illustration", "blackcat", "synth", "sampler"], "extra": {}}
