It is not a dog but a lion (\u7345\u5b50shi-shi means lion), which was a protector of Buddha. Originating in India, it came to China and Japan, and changed\u00a0shape to it's current design with colourful curly hair and dot\u00a0patterns.\u00a0Karashishi has a strong power and eats your bad luck. However it holds bugs in it's fur which may eat Karashishi's body and kill it. But water drops\u00a0from\u00a0peonies can kill these bugs, so Karashishi always sleeps under the peony flowers. There are not many motief rules with tattoos, but when you get a Karashishi tattoo, usually you get peony flowers too so they can protect Karashishi. It's called Karashishi-Botan (Fu Dog and Peony)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ9Vb6HthnD8odrDfJCCxksnJn7Qw8mNNd14yBkrpLx5i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP4eNS21D3EndHKjqmQTS8i2u7JkTMnB4Y9EK6rU9T5HN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ9Vb6HthnD8odrDfJCCxksnJn7Qw8mNNd14yBkrpLx5i", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MaNYPQB6AWtrHv7ArMUGJwUJi8jKmtXCV"], "tags": ["character", "c4d", "animal", "3d"], "extra": {}}
