{"__version": 1, "token_id": 311866, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Russian Blue Cat", "description": "The Russian Blue cat is medium to large in size with an elegant, graceful body and long, slim legs. The cat walks as if on tip-toes. The head is wedged shaped with prominent whisker pads and large ears. The vivid green eyes are set wide apart and are almond shaped. The coat is double with a very dense undercoat and feels fine, short and soft. In texture the coat of the Russian Blue cat is very different from any other breed and is the truest measure of the breed. Although named the Russian Blue, black and white Russian cats do sometimes appear. In the most popular blue variety, the coat colour is a clear even blue with a silvery sheen.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUMdQrPkxpuDwTE3Qb4oZbvwyqj8ULexVVbMhujcpcfMe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUMdQrPkxpuDwTE3Qb4oZbvwyqj8ULexVVbMhujcpcfMe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUMdQrPkxpuDwTE3Qb4oZbvwyqj8ULexVVbMhujcpcfMe", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["pixelart", "cat", "pet", "animal", "objkt4objkt", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
