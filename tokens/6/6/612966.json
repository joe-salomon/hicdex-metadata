{"__version": 1, "token_id": 612966, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Caged", "description": "Sometimes I think we are all caged. By this pandemic, by our responsibilities, by the system, by the past, by situations, by relationships, by expectations, by emotions, even by our own mind. For me, being caged by our own mind is probably the worst. Especially if it\u2019s filled with negative thoughts, and you don\u2019t know how to get out of it, you don\u2019t have the key. The world outside may be beautiful and filled with joy, sun, falling stars, rainbows, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything if your cage is filled with gray clouds and smoke. Well, I\u2019ve tried planning an escape, but then I don\u2019t really know where to go once I\u2019m out.\n\nMaybe the answer isn\u2019t always to find the key and get out. Maybe it\u2019s better to just decorate the cage with cats and beaches. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s 6:30am I should be sleeping but I\u2019m writing this long-ass caption instead. I don\u2019t even know wtf am I talking about lol anyway, thank you for coming to my Ted talk. \ud83d\udc80", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaorxYgXhF87BgxKnt4bgn9yFuWwv2tEmoCZHmJBRQfeL", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcc6dA2QBi2abXsmya48rcKUerS5Tr73vQcsiYs9ymNAk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmdd3tkJkZhYRWM7UKBEz6z6hECRGhZ78pQSWMRJPqBePL", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaorxYgXhF87BgxKnt4bgn9yFuWwv2tEmoCZHmJBRQfeL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2C6WYquQnCfeKPjr7Sdiw3zEtjEFGQjnDm"], "tags": ["illustration", "surrealism"], "extra": {}}
