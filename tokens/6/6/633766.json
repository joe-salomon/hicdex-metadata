{"__version": 1, "token_id": 633766, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Remains", "description": "A blend of ancient antiquity and contemporary retro-futurism.  The focus of this piece is the scene that evokes unearthly remains of another realm while resembling historical conventional traditions.  A reflection of the past on historic moments.  In retrospect, we see ourselves as giants, which reflects our yearning for the past \u2014 looking back on major moments in our life and how they just faded into memory.  \n\n\u2018Remains\u2019 is envisioned as a historical story that dates back to a flourishing water village inhabited by fishermen (Padians), who paddled the rivers selling various commodities with the villagers.  The 'Padians' were once the face of the village, reflecting a strong previous identity; here I depicted it as the 'giant.' However, there is not a single Padian in sight today.  The giants have sunk into obscurity with the passage of time. \n\nThe giant sculpture is a grunge-textured element intended to reflect the wearing of old relics of vanishing culture and tradition.  The outcome of these elements is a work that portrays a never-ending search for the past.  Reminiscing about significant events in life and how they simply vanished and became memories. Look forward to the future, for it is better to create memories than to forget them.   \n \n| Created & Rendered: 27 November 2021\n| 2160\u200a\u00d7\u200a2880 [PNG/JPEG]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW4rugLFUC64iXabpLTNGXtnAJfKAHypuSV84821CoPKV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmefqVLYmfoJutCw6wSCbx82guW8s8eASocByVX5UE8u2M", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWF4ASz5akLenga1jffkW6kzCWLETvm6L869w8SatyAY2", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW4rugLFUC64iXabpLTNGXtnAJfKAHypuSV84821CoPKV", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SCVEqinpMpmLZEXm8y2DUB4Pwf2ewQvuJ"], "tags": ["zagestudio", "brunei", "3dart", "conceptart", "history", "3d", "giants", "time", "concept", "surreal", "cgi", "cgart"], "extra": {}}
