It is a typical Brazilian legend, of indigenous origin, that goes from the north to the south of the country. \nThey say that it actually comes to explain the phenomenon known as \"fogo-f\u00e1tuo\", which is the combustion of gases that escape from the ground.\nIf you encounter Boitat\u00e1, close your eyes and stop breathing! Otherwise you will be driven mad!\nI have already seen one such phenomenon in the countryside. Thank goodness I know the legend of Boitat\u00e1.\n\n\nAll rights reserved to Mohzah Nascimento.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmazMa7qSvMAAjaQkKf4Z4B38NH19jZV81p5mF6QJXjYMf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZzQXkhgBXBTLDmmNsMLeSmtjjdMfSz8wqY1HKbeyeMPA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmazMa7qSvMAAjaQkKf4Z4B38NH19jZV81p5mF6QJXjYMf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fwGb9vHQARr63TiurEGhzKiZcupNEZ7Hh"], "tags": ["cordel", "white", "mito", "lenda", "black", "flaming", "snake", "brazilianculture", "alchemy", "brazil", "xylography", "red", "blue", "boitata"], "extra": {}}
