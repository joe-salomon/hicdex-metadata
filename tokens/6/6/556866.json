Perhaps to glory and revel with pride in the glory of man is something that happens before the fall, but my pride takes the form of being proud of everyone who contributes to the support and organization of society, so that society may continue and flourish. Man has begun to right the wrongs it has inflicted upon the Earth. I have witnessed bison being reintroduced to the plains, the ozone layer making a recovery, the championing of the common bee, forests being planted, and an overall global consciousness of the fact we are in this together. No longer shall mankind be a scourge upon the face of the land and their mother earth! Of course there are still many problems but we are waging war against them, which is what we can do. Come what may, and let us bind together for the betterment of Earth and humankind!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeAxneY4M3FTquzR3xuJorF9DoQ6c63TPwjvcV6p2WxRA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZDBbyyhHyEbyfZXZNuXm75ScbegQx7TSm9nZdR9kFxrX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeAxneY4M3FTquzR3xuJorF9DoQ6c63TPwjvcV6p2WxRA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1c7jjnQj2Puu8qNpyMsMWt9n8vg7VhBtZ3"], "tags": ["Clarity"], "extra": {}}
