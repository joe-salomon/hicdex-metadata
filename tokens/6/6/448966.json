I spent over an hour trying to capture one. I saw hundreds, but my timing was always off. This was my favourite image from that night. the exhaust from my car, mixed with my lil flashlight & falling snow transported me to another world, sitting there in complete silence, watching the world come to life around me. It was a magical moment ill never forget. I hope this takes you there, a moment so still & beautiful.
