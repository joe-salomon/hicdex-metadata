But the sacredness of the Jaguar\nSpirit represents the journey of the sun across the sky and the darkness of night\nrepresented the infinite journey of human consciousness and its transformations. The\nmidday sun\u2019s position was compared to the Eagle, flying high in the sky, to then plunge\nbelow the horizon, just as we plunge into the dark to face our spiritual challenges and to be\ntransformed. The hidden sun was said to be Jaguar, whose spotted skin represents the\nstars glittering/shining in the night sky. Hence it was called the \u201cJaguar Sun.\u201d Jaguar is the\nearth father, holding the authority over the sacred power of and in the earth, and the\nanimals who live upon it. The force that lives within the mountains, giving them their\nvolcanic and transformative power, is the same underworld source of energy and power\ncontained within the Jaguar Sun.
