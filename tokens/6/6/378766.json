Our bodies have a way of telling us what\u2019s right and what isn\u2019t and we have an amazing way of overriding our own signals.\n\nFind how you express yourself in the world.\n\nHow you live is an expression, what you do and the way you do it is an expression. How you interact with others and nature is expressing who you are. Are you making choices for who you really are or for someone else or what you think you should do? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of pressure from the outside to conform to what we \u201cshould\u201d do. There\u2019s barely time to just sit and find out who we are and what we want. The things that sing from our soul match with people, places and actions on the outside. \n\nIs your life a mirror of your soul? \nIs it a celebration of your being? \n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ2JKLErMUCY6UgUEhbwd9wja2bhFCd9LkdwtXqv3pvaY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSwh3NYv7TJ6ENCRLD3TCzwuEcjTPHj9PRMizCLxDkdj4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ2JKLErMUCY6UgUEhbwd9wja2bhFCd9LkdwtXqv3pvaY", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
