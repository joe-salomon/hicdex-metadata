Some day I stopped listening to loud music in noise-cancelling DJ headphones, stopped listening to podcasts but paid more attention to the world I am walking in.\n\nSince I made a shift I see more around me. In the same routes, places, same 'boring' walks. There is much to see if you get out of your head.\n\nThis photo has a lot to see. It was made in spring 2017 and edited a little bit (crop and colors, contrast).\n\nI can explain how I see this image and _what_ I see in it but I will leave it behind. I let every observer find something for themselves in this photo. (If you wish to hear about my perception you can ask me)\n\nI only say that it was the very beginning of spring in Estonia.\n\nTwitter: @feelosopher777\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe collector is allowed to make a print for a home or any other space use, or a personal clothing/accessory print but reproduction for a commercial use whatsoever is not allowed upon collecting of this NFT artwork.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPdb2j74KbgSHauQEixFJug1z3mqjcPKMn7f821aUE17g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRE8UwCLN5P9WYpPV1mrfv3hmQi1989oyrcSJtTffhGvJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPdb2j74KbgSHauQEixFJug1z3mqjcPKMn7f821aUE17g", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DaWYqtntv59GLLBULYTiubQs9EFr55aGo"], "tags": ["spring", "Estonia", "2017", "streetphotography", "photography", "streetphotography", "drip", "sun", "garage", "\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f", "metaphysicalphotography", "minimal", "minimalism", "shadow", "light", "minimalistic", "plain", "observation", "Europe", "postsoviet", "easterneurope", "thaw", "street"], "extra": {}}
