We are bound to follow that defined path and hence, trapped in a loop.\"\n\nLoop: It's dedicated to Life being a loop of time. When you start you won't realize its importance, When you are running behind it, it almost ends\". Each moment, you are being presented with two choices: Evolve or repeat. It is us who decide, whether to choose or for the time being blame it on circumstance.\n--\n\"BINARY EMOTIONS\" is a series based on 12 Single Edition Fragments in which the artist aims to translate his inner nuances within a specific moment into visuals that evoke certain emotions. An emotional journey digitized into a binary piece cataloged onto the blockchain.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYzxppvpiKsPTyq8ggobgtxzpUQ7Lhz19DhUjrwNPdjD5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQBZtSf2bnsG61zzhtkwAL5q21vXRrryp5VSVa2znBQXE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYzxppvpiKsPTyq8ggobgtxzpUQ7Lhz19DhUjrwNPdjD5", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bjGdjBLbwdr8ptGcjakKAeM6TLU6UzLgP"], "tags": ["loop", "time", "rare", "fragment", "five", "maze", "stuck", "travel", "choose", "binary", "emotion", "nuance", "light", "firstlight", "fragment", "series", "scifi", "animation", "glitch", "colors", "tech", "cyberpunk", "dark", "music", "sound"], "extra": {}}
