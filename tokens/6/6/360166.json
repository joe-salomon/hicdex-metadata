It has the head of a human, the body of a lion and a tail of venomous spines similar to porcupine quills, while other depictions have it with the tail of a scorpion. There are some accounts that the spines can be shot like arrows, thus making the manticore a lethal predator. It devours its prey whole, using its triple rows of teeth, leaving no traces of its victims (including bones) behind.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTGLC7MTadB8q759bpaNiUaJcMUMbjPW7ejaYGF1Mtq2N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVUVsSQe8XMRMQtN7NavWnX4RkVxa6pwVWEZfMe3CuJEB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTGLC7MTadB8q759bpaNiUaJcMUMbjPW7ejaYGF1Mtq2N", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MPkPpmwVZFXwxpEivAMiZKa2EbyACLJFy"], "tags": ["hunting", "nft", "nftartist", "trick", "darkart", "dark", "legendarycreature"], "extra": {}}
