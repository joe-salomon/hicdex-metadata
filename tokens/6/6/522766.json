{"__version": 1, "token_id": 522766, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SOMETIMES I FALL DOWN & HIT ROCK BOTTOM.", "description": "SOMETIMES I FALL DOWN & HIT ROCK BOTTOM is a narrative that illustrates how a traumatic event in our lives can shake you to your core and cause you to fall (emotionally / mentally / spiritually / financially / physically) and hit rock bottom (emotionally / mentally / spiritually / financially / physically). No human escapes life unscathed from pain and no human escapes unscathed from life's pain. Doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, what you do, when you were born, or how you live; we all fall down at some point. Notice I used the term \"fall\" and I didn't use the term fail or failure. Author and inspirational speaker Simon Sinek says, \"the problem with the word fail is it's like the word cancer...if you have stage four lung cancer or stage four liver cancer and you have a mild melanoma with a 99.999% chance you'll be fine, both of those things are called cancer and the problem is that they're not the same thing and failure is the same thing. Failure could be catastrophic or it could be a minor hiccup, but the problem is we call it failure. So I think we need to use different terms.\" When we fall, we pick ourselves back up and we go on. Don't let a fall cause you to fail. Get back up and keep going!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeuwPaxH6RiSLrFkkodK4gJg8kf9biJrchUNYsW4yr54G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdgLYtbTbi5cwFZvBwDnFsVY8Db4egxtYtJ5dSBY9E4T4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeuwPaxH6RiSLrFkkodK4gJg8kf9biJrchUNYsW4yr54G", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
