{"__version": 1, "token_id": 573866, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Burn it all down ", "description": "My work blends everyday occurrences from my life in Brooklyn with abstracted nightmares and crude humor. Trained as an illustrator, I tries to tell a story with every piece I make, developing a personal and slightly sinister narrative within each painting. Using candy colors, heavy patterning, and tight compositions, the work draws inspiration from American folk art, the cartoons I watched as a kid, and my appreciation for architecture. I am always striving to make work that is highly personal but altered enough to allow individual interpretations to be applied to every story I paints.\nSize : 1289 \u00d7 1600 px\nDate : 2017", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPPUNRVZDogg5yZfUX48zmTUnsNcN7HpGYHsguKCAoQjn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUyDWoTAgWfUEwjyhHBdWn7Bbt4SKSGy91PUGaBudoCmp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPPUNRVZDogg5yZfUX48zmTUnsNcN7HpGYHsguKCAoQjn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gsTBHe2x7xTnQNCnBGqpCcZoWefxFaBTz"], "tags": ["nudeart", "nude", "art", "painting", "drawing", "psychedelicart", "nudepainting", "illustration", "psychedeliccolor", "color", "girls", ""], "extra": {}}
