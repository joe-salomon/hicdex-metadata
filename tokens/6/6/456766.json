The pieces will last from 1 to 7 minutes due to the BPM variation and the use of 'Elastic Audio'.\n\nGIF -\nResolution: 500p x 500p\nFrames: 29.97fps\n45 color depth\nWAV -\nSampling rate (audio): 48kHz 24-bit\nBit rate (audio): 1519 kbps", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYrwGr1Wo2CxykWkFySWH729xpTNMakaifiV6CBQeZh7b", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaMTjFbbpwjxgBBkvonCMB9ddxPgh4N4maRBPEFdbSErh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYrwGr1Wo2CxykWkFySWH729xpTNMakaifiV6CBQeZh7b", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1Tp8PHdx2KsvHyVWb4NaGev8wXLk1HwqCw"], "tags": ["cleannft", "wav", "mp4", "max", "automato", "collection", "generativeart", "coding", "generativemusic", "unique", "lucy"], "extra": {}}
