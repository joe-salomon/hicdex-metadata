The four members formed the night the complete Dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991 and hailed from Kaliningrad, Russia (formerly known as K\u00f6nigsberg, during the Prussian Empire). Though technically still in Russia, Kaliningrad is an exclave community (completely surrounded by Lithuania and Poland), cut off from the rest of the nation. When the Berlin Wall fell back in November of 1989, they wanted to play music, but felt the timing wasn't right just yet. But, within this new dawn, hope and their freedom, they began in earnest to take all of their American jazz influences, which under Soviet was forbidden, and gave their Russian flare to the genre. Much to their surprise, almost instantly winning over critics and jazz fans alike. They specifically wanted to take what Jazz critic, Joachim-Ernst Berendt described as, \"form of art music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music\" and embrace it for Russians to feel, experience, and learn from for the first time. Who knew that Russians could related and interpret the works of Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Thelonius Monk, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker, Josephine Baker, Duke Ellington, and so many more on top of writing their own works? What made them unique was how they mixed traditional jazz instruments (saxaphone, upright bass, piano, trombones, and others) with traditional Russian instruments (balalaika, domra, gusli, accordions, and others). The wild jumble caused quite the stir within the Jazz community with some embracing them and some shunning them altogether. They made many, many recordings over the years and still perform to this day.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQKV7Rh29X9q9cWdj7mvWmzx4y6Kkxy4pKyEP3E4joNhW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdCgi2cjSpQkmsGPqMyd5zEetxdcAqqZcC6htHpZdERTc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQKV7Rh29X9q9cWdj7mvWmzx4y6Kkxy4pKyEP3E4joNhW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
