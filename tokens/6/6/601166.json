One day it showed itself to the boy after seeing him near death, asking the boy if he wanted his help. The spirit warned him that once joining his body there was no way back, the kid accepted the offer without hesitation. \nWhen his abusive parents unlocked the door to see what loud noise came from the room, they saw the glowing red eyes move towards them, slowly revealing a creature with the appearance of the boy now with big dove wings. They tried to run away, but the creature got them and set the house ablaze. This piece depicts the moment right after the massacre.
