For today's piece however, I wanted to dedicate it to the fans of both NFTs & Mechas that Mekan't drive one (badumtss lol). It doesn't matter the reason for not being able to collect the drop, but what I do know is that the MekaVerse nfts look incredibly sick & more than likely, I myself would never be able to get my hands on one or have part of the amazing project T_T. That alone inspired this. Some sort of animated glitch MekaVerse fan art & tribute.\n\nMinting 50/50 editions of this baby..you are able to collect one of them for 0.5 TEZ\n \n\ninstagram for this ongoing collection:@fiasco9.0 \n\ntwitter: @no5ay_\n(info on nft drops, life updates, WIPs, other art collections /burnedbyairfryer, /fiasco9.0, /thequietcanvas, & more soon)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNe9v5mdC8pJWxs63p7zjkwG4ekZCrXvCvguHeyvApFs8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZVKNQqAuVyksBWh37YYw5kBWpqR1iMVAa3CUT3LKVqJB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNe9v5mdC8pJWxs63p7zjkwG4ekZCrXvCvguHeyvApFs8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["mekaverse", "nft", "collection", "make", "shift", "tribute", "dedication", "fan", "art", "digital", "glitch", "manipulation", "fiasco9.0", "no5ay_"], "extra": {}}
