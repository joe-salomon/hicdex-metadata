In Guatemala, they are made of wire, wool and colorful textile leftovers. The dolls are then dressed in traditional Mayan style. The size of the doll can vary between \u00bd inch and 2.0 inches. In western culture, the dolls are mostly made of pressed paper, adhesive tape, paper and colorful wool.\n\nIn the dolls original Guatemalan tradition, a local legend about the origin of the Mu\u00f1eca \"quitapena\" refers to a Mayan princess named Ixmucane (Popol Vuh). The princess received a special gift from the sun god which would allow her to solve any problem a human could worry about.\n\nIn traditional and modern times, worry dolls are given or lent to brooding, anxious or sorrowful children. They would tell their doll about their sorrows, fears and worries, then hide it under their pillow before going to sleep at night. It is said that the child relinquishes their worries to the dolls during the night and by the next morning, all sorrows are said to have been taken away by the worry doll and they can move forward refreshed the next day.\n\nEspecial edition still macro photography\nSigned by the artist\n4620x6160 px, sRGB", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYNt58x84BgaaxLw5pq9Vq8aSSL4KuZEhUStdaney5Bhx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV4QurjtHd8qV4DRkAyvbmQREf29xBuiEpgBaTKRzF4Xn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYNt58x84BgaaxLw5pq9Vq8aSSL4KuZEhUStdaney5Bhx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ccfZCsi5p6LWnmpGRYaVz83Um3119LM9x"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
