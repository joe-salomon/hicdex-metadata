The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: I got a nice jacket, hat, and gloves, but my feet are so painful they hurt to walk. Is there anything I can do? The doctor says yes, there\u2019s a boot or mechanism that must be removed. I\u2019ll have to pay for the repair. I look for a bathroom. The room has been used, but there\u2019s no sign of the owner. I go into the bedroom, which is dark and cramped. I try to move about, but I can\u2019t seem to sit or stand. There\u2019s something inside the bed, it must be sturdy or heavy, but I can\u2019t quite place my weight. I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m freaking out. I\u2019m going to pass out.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 106 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfGMuXKWPPBTYv57hZVVmzR7DhtRvHv1VXcojPWEmZ3vf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdMmQs5EtWM2UzC3B51cXLMWSz3AVRKqVbUwfWgxPHQn7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfGMuXKWPPBTYv57hZVVmzR7DhtRvHv1VXcojPWEmZ3vf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
