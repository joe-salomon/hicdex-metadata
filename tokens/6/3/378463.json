The one who can control the mind is the one who knows what is real.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeSnDxyWtbTs973MaNWCJ4BEnf6XV5wGKtQNeSTUBrDCd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbbUYTzYzHFwf3QLyYVV9PDH7D1vgtDhnn2PZVDDanCzi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeSnDxyWtbTs973MaNWCJ4BEnf6XV5wGKtQNeSTUBrDCd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hPp4gJqfmscYWr28nxbyq4RZ3XfRzzscD"], "tags": ["#Chess#1/1#oneonly#Mind#BoardGame#Cryptoart#King#Pawn#Animation"], "extra": {}}
