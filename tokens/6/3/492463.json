The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: It\u2019s Friday night. My new girlfriend and I are staying at a house owned by my old roommate. It\u2019s pretty much the house my parents lived at when I was young. There\u2019s a big front yard with a nice little vegetable garden. It\u2019s very peaceful here. Late at night, as we sleep on the floor, I imagine what it\u2019s like to be captured by Asian men in military uniforms and taken to a secret mountain base. I imagine one man will penetrate me, until all my sex desires are released.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 110 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ7rHsR6Wm1zC9AJnRigxitt17UWaeRrCE5Gc1NAD1f4N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQr1tZKKYkKP8o9bwFnoucpuzzQSQtLxNBa9tWjMaSsRA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ7rHsR6Wm1zC9AJnRigxitt17UWaeRrCE5Gc1NAD1f4N", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
