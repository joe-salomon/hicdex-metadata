Like Midas, we touched everything and turned our\nhouses into plastic, we paved our oceans with plastic, we\nstained our wings and even our stomachs. Here we live,\ncontemplating a transparent and reusable cage.\nSacred Plastics is a material statement, a picture of the\npresent we are living in, a breath drowned in plastic. It is a\ncall to action trying to recover a lost identity, ours, that of\nall of us who let ourselves be perverted by the comfort of\nan escape forward, of a senseless growth. Will you continue\nplasticizing your life?\n\nwww.gastonlisak.com\nwww.instagram.com/gastonlisak\n\nSize: 1872\u200a\u00d7\u200a2363\nCamera used: Canon EOS 5D Mark II\nFocal Lenght: 69 mm\nExposure time: 1/200\n\n\u00a9 2021 Gast\u00f3n U.
