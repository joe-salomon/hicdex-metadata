{"__version": 1, "token_id": 531463, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "RIPE  VERY / RIP E VERY / RIP  EVERY", "description": "Time for another BLG! This time we have the words: RIP & VERY. When we insert an \"E\" in between them we create two entirely new words: RIPE & EVERY. Lately, I've been thinking about the subtlety and ease of how words share letters as if they emerge from a quantum foam like state or substance and then make their way to our eyes through the act of reading; like magic. It never ceases to amaze me of just how pliable English really is. Is this all coincidence or is there an underlying pattern or structure that allows for these variants to occur? I would presume that Linguistics would be the answer to this. In the future, I think I want to do some research and study how all of these \"coincidences\" happen and how the language exists even without speaking, writing, and/or communicating. There's something underlying within the properties of shared symbols for communication that intrigues and beguiles me.
