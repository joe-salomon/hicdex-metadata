During my work on SPACER COLONIES and OUTSKIRTS, I got fascinated by the relationship and evolution between input patterns/textures and the AI-imagined output.\n\nNEURONALWELLE explores that relationship by letting a gan imagine ocean waves over various input patterns/textures. In some works, visualisations of that relationship are integrated in the piece itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcCYTSN2rbziAthNvEJidBRaeMPjqRacJR2PLR9NX7u5C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcCYTSN2rbziAthNvEJidBRaeMPjqRacJR2PLR9NX7u5C", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcCYTSN2rbziAthNvEJidBRaeMPjqRacJR2PLR9NX7u5C", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QyRHPc1w9T4BKHXkNPZnMfQybU5cfFXkx"], "tags": ["ai", "generative", "artificialintelligence", "gan"], "extra": {}}
