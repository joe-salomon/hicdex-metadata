No flows or coherent. It just depends on me. There is no meanings of sequence in this project.\n+This is the experiment project so there are always some small changes. I may announce the changes or not it depends on me.\n+Mint a photo 7da22yz a week for 356dayz a year. From 3rd September(Fri)2021 to 2nd September(Fri)2022\n\nWhat was the motivation for this project?\u2028\nTo see and learn how this space works. but mainly to prove I was not wrong that I didn\u2019t post constantly my artwork on instagram. Also I wanted to challenge myself whether I can do it everyday or not if its not on Instagram. \u2028\u2028 In my philosophy, when someone do something for proving to someone or something another, most probably these stuff is boring and lack of depth. Unfortunately, this project is NOT probably nothing. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. So you can casually enjoy my photographs. Don\u2019t need to think too much. This project is lame as hell and sounds like so ngmi but I had to do it. I hope I still exist in this space in September 2022 and understand this space better.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmajqV43bL1aYk6yuv1gm7bBajw2gz16GaFwRMYY1vP1tE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXq2YcWfx3yV2FiXfKvpEnyoXjdkwaWnjCazrGeAVcHfg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmajqV43bL1aYk6yuv1gm7bBajw2gz16GaFwRMYY1vP1tE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fMsfAN5DS55pDvMAF7KCNaUhqK2DJtX75"], "tags": ["HENphoto365dayz", "photo", "photography", "gemini"], "extra": {}}
