Every shot of the show includes a powerful color palette and this visceral blacklight feeling that instills a sense of immersion and passion. The characters themselves have strong motivations and as the episode progresses you're able to put together more and more pieces of information about this world and about the characters. I wanted to try and create a still frame from that world that would not only match the aesthetics but showcase the tech used in the episode.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNPJeZwpKgppcRmVggPnUXrfhCa25r7339veAAH1EApTz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRWvoxfqQQ8AHqJh2C3X3rNpyo8EiY4MReaHm1tPVcVit", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNPJeZwpKgppcRmVggPnUXrfhCa25r7339veAAH1EApTz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1c7jjnQj2Puu8qNpyMsMWt9n8vg7VhBtZ3"], "tags": ["VR"], "extra": {}}
