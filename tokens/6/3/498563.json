{"__version": 1, "token_id": 498563, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Four people looking at the moon", "description": "The painting shows a leitmotif of the Romantic view of nature and identification image of Romanticism. The motif with its gentle melancholic mood is the epitome of the romantic view of nature. The three people contemplating the crescent moon act as back figures in their mediating function as representatives of the viewer. The picture is predominantly seen in its metaphorical layout as a contemplative contemplation without its object becoming clear and is thus an offer of contemplation for the viewer.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRTJhYDkzrBkjS5w4q18ewkUtDSifuuy2vGd6JR8HFnMF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYhfTHh6t43n6dYQA8vjeyjafipvy46Z1bzoxxR7okwwr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmRTJhYDkzrBkjS5w4q18ewkUtDSifuuy2vGd6JR8HFnMF"}], "creators": ["tz1RQRZEToscP9yRde16XoJZubtq4fLFyyWm"], "tags": ["painting", "art", "romanticism"], "extra": {}}
