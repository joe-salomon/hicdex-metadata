H=N BLOCK celebrates the H=N Community, allowing multiple users to contribute to a multi-subjective & multi-objective collaborative whole, an open architecture of collaborative objects. These shared blocks are visible as long as a visitor is Here And Now. Activities on 19.09.2021 were captured, 3908 BLOCKs were instantiated by 88 curious artists and visitors, and were explored by 230 visitors of the H=N Community. The top 9 builders that placed the most blocks, ranging from 1245 to 61 Blocks, are receiving this OBJKT via an air-drop. \n_______ H=N BLOCK + A __________ \nH=N BLOCK+A is an extension patch(Architecture Kit) for H=N BLOCK(OBJKT#187962), enabling realtime collaborative and participatory design using an architectural kit of parts.\n_________________ \nby Alexander Grasser, 2021 @grasser_alex alexandergrasser.com #collaborativeobjects #realtimearchitecture #architecturemachine", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYDtpBmgwnko4vzReTzP7d89dZRFfCN6nXs6SyyMPqM89", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQT4HwvSxeLvd6SQAaMLdAZ9qTDoAXvHdDQhxcQ1dhNtU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYDtpBmgwnko4vzReTzP7d89dZRFfCN6nXs6SyyMPqM89", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iZ9yHJzgvC4oBvHsrNmtL8GHPqtwqshAi"], "tags": ["architecture", "open", "blockchain", "architecturemachine", "interactive", "realtime", "platform", "configurator", "creativecoding", "generative", "generativeart", "voxel", "madebycode", "madebyhumans", "techno", "participatory", "block", "commons", "monochrome", "polychrome", "CollaborativeObjects"], "extra": {}}
