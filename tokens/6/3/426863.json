{"__version": 1, "token_id": 426863, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ramiel: The Fifth Angel", "description": "Ramiel (\u30e9\u30df\u30a8\u30eb) (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc) is the Fifth Angel, one of the largest and second most powerful. Ramiel becomes the first Angel to physically penetrate the Geofront when its drill bit breaks through the armor.\nCompared to the Angels which preceded it, Ramiel has a drastically different form and does not appear to be \"alive\" in a conventional sense, it appears to be a gigantic, floating, crystalline octahedron (two pyramids attached at the base, one on top and one on bottom). The surface of Ramiel is blue and highly reflective.\n\nVideo:\nby introboiz\n2560 X 1440\n12501kbps\n15 fps\n.mp4\n\nAudio:\nby Root Network\n319kbps\n48000kHz\n.wav", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR4xhdFYAgfoUqBAyNm8noAvY3cqt5pTfngoiCxSwh6no", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXXYeSN6cy4tPRcZCZeNSFfAtTYPyRsJMpo3Swwf4L4Se", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR4xhdFYAgfoUqBAyNm8noAvY3cqt5pTfngoiCxSwh6no", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XBffw8QWeLoUA5WL6eb3pPxqUaNz1mNC6"], "tags": ["neongenesisevangelion", "ramiel", "angels", "basicshapes", "sounddesign", "loop", "audiovisual", "motion"], "extra": {}}
