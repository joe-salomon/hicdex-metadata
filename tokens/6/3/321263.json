LITTLE does she know that her pride is worth more than her chains; that her joy is greater than her chains; that her shadow is greater than the sun; that her dress is finer than any lace; that her flesh is a treasure greater than all gold; that her dress is better than any lace; that her flesh is a skin better than any fleece; that her breath is a sweeter drink than any other; that her death is sweeter than the sun's; that her chains are shinier than the sun's; that her heart is emptier than the wind; that her breath is hotter than the sun's; that her death is sweeter than the sun's.\nLittle does she know, that her chains are broken, and that her heart desires release; that her breath is beaten, and that her chains are loosened; that she'll turn around and smile at you. While her shadow is greater than the sun, and while her breath is brighter than the sun, she'll turn around and smile at you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPJGEriafvGxeTyi5P1EfwuCQSEVGhGcj7waVbmSndfc8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWSz9mdm6pMrgtT6zHq9Hjfcm9RWa739YVJ6yDTEvj3FU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPJGEriafvGxeTyi5P1EfwuCQSEVGhGcj7waVbmSndfc8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1bchTMEsYtQLZCaRc713M5feyfxzPD87TM"], "tags": ["Littledoessheknow", "girl", "erotic", "neural", "ai", "expressionism"], "extra": {}}
