The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: There are only a few people in the class.\u00a0The teacher is talking. She\u2019s talking about the Vietnam war. She says she\u2019s tired of hearing about it. She wants to talk about something else. But I say I want to talk about the bombing. I\u2019m aware that something is wrong. I\u2019m standing to one side. As the teacher goes through her written materials I say, \u201cI want to talk about the bombing.\u201d There are many objects placed before me. I\u2019m holding an M-79, a small machine gun, which is placed on a sling wrapped around my body. A principal goes up on a tall platform. He has a long .45 pistol. He is confident and smiling. There is the night air. There is the city. There is the big black bomber behind him. As he walks forward, I brace myself for the hit. What is that scraping noise? The big bomber crashes into the sea.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 78 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbJsxbPFhefFH4VZn3CAmtYW8WfKpBvvQmLpaQme3i4z1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWKVQh2Fnr6VTqMLUrdXwPDfRxGjJ2MLm2FHFFAX6ZKee", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbJsxbPFhefFH4VZn3CAmtYW8WfKpBvvQmLpaQme3i4z1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
