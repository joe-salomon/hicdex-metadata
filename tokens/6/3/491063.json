Its original goal was to be sold as a distinctive badge that allowed early access to a hidden park in the Metaverse. \n\nIn the beginning, the sales were a success and people were scrambling to get their badges. However, shortly after the park opened, the excitement faded and the badges could be seen covering the entire park floor. Only scavengers spent their energy collecting them for resale to recycling centers.\n\nThe GANg Pepe keeps a badge among the things that he doesn't want to throw away but doesn't want to show anyone either.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSrrhw6qcf37LsW6Jg81qJDer6eoQw9zrUcDzdU8x6nXZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSrrhw6qcf37LsW6Jg81qJDer6eoQw9zrUcDzdU8x6nXZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSrrhw6qcf37LsW6Jg81qJDer6eoQw9zrUcDzdU8x6nXZ", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hfFMMcYmsXdaxAPR9BHuNTqerdZuQAHBE"], "tags": ["zuck", "dank", "ai", "ganart", "glitch", "zoku", "GANgPepe"], "extra": {}}
