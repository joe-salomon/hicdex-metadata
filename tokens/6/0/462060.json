And this is what I do right now trying to find and capture the meaning in our life. The advantage of shooting black and white is that you don't have to think a lot about colours and lights: it is a very minimal form of photography but this also means: A LOT of photos. For this reason, I've decided that my daily shots following themes, patterns and subjects will be part of a big NFT collection. My goal is to be a reference for black and white NFT photography while giving people the possibility to collect as many as possible fragments of my life. This is what technology also allows us to do: seeing the world through other's people eyes. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma17Fo8t265NkTqM8Yk9yHw17FKWq5viRQC7Q65PFhgLT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZfm4t4hRqnDkp3Kt49S9isPbKdpwdy31jxFzZvW7SszN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma17Fo8t265NkTqM8Yk9yHw17FKWq5viRQC7Q65PFhgLT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hgBSKWzBqzfL2d7zng1vVhLa3JNgGn2Mb"], "tags": ["streetphotography", "streetphoto", "art", "photo", "fujifilm", "ricohgr3", "photography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhite", "black", "white", "ricohgriii", "fujifilm", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "art"], "extra": {}}
