In this collection, a circle (not depicted) is divided into triangles and other geometric shapes to form stars with varying number of points. Each piece consists of hundreds of semi-transparent triangles that set the color mood and dozens of triangles on top providing the shading/highlights and the white outlines (in some sets not shown for more artistic look). \n\nDimensions: 4800 x 4800", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaSRLmW4hZ2tRgnpaycH8x8fC37difaZtrxofnxjNPwzC", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma7vvi87jY3A4LbGxwH5yMZAY4z5omWg2NLioiBUtCMwG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaSRLmW4hZ2tRgnpaycH8x8fC37difaZtrxofnxjNPwzC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fPY1cnN1YGSWDxxiMbJ4BcUYFwK13wheA"], "tags": ["star", "generative", "art"], "extra": {}}
