{"__version": 1, "token_id": 344360, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Water colours 31: Incursions", "description": "There is a strangeness to minting NFTs. Consider the water colour series, to which this piece belongs. The original pieces are all on GitHub, complete with the source code and a reproducible R environment. The images are public domain under CC0 licence and the code is free via MIT licence [1]. There is a public gallery including all the pieces [2], a detailed tutorial discussing how they are made [3], and a blog post talking openly about how ambivalent I feel about NFTs [4]. This series has already been used to raise money for charity, and in some sense has done its job already [5]\n\n[1] https://github.com/djnavarro/series-water-colours/\n[2] https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/water-colours/\n[3] https://blog.djnavarro.net/water-colours/\n[4] https://essays.djnavarro.net/post/intimacy-and-art/\n[5] https://www.gofundme.com/f/data-science-art-to-support-a-womens-refuge\n\nSo why would anyone want to own this token? What value does it have to you? What makes it a tradeable OBJKT that can accrue market value? The art is valuable to *me* because of the symbolic relationship it has to the grief I experienced and the emotions I felt when I was coding the system, but why would this be of value to you? Everything you might ever want to do with this piece you can already do. You don't need to buy this token. It should be worthless to you.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYkpQvUvpZXcwrsUTtWbnVCBE296YoDEdScfJkXvTRHoV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZqQHbHVAg7up2Uy9MhfWbCBgUaJR3CeesDS4cZe6cqg2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYkpQvUvpZXcwrsUTtWbnVCBE296YoDEdScfJkXvTRHoV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7"], "tags": ["generativeart", "simplexnoise", "fractals", "grief"], "extra": {}}
