{"__version": 1, "token_id": 621760, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "DEATHLY", "description": "Occasionally, I return to a previous design and think about it in a new way. Call it nostalgia, or call it perfectionism; either way reinterpreting a work is an interesting feeling. It almost feels like playing with a friend on a creative level. Take DEATHLY for instance. It's a similar design to BRANDY, but this time instead of being asymmetrical, it's symmetrical. It's interesting to see the lattices begin to form and you begin to see larger structures at play or building. What we are left with on this particular work is almost syntax crystals within other syntax crystals. If you squint your eyes, the colors blend into the background and the image gives the illusion of fading somewhat.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXnWJbnhERm8r43rR1v9fFYax4sNXLpHTB3AqrJ9BLFgQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSPbkd5AWWaBNbn8aKBf8UAH58JWZK5KNC4FEY9MTjE53", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXnWJbnhERm8r43rR1v9fFYax4sNXLpHTB3AqrJ9BLFgQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
