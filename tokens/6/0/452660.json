One of his phrases could be translated, in Portuguese, as \"the relationships run through the gap of the fingers\". According to his concept of \"liquid relationships\", formulated, for example, in Liquid Love, love relationships cease to have an aspect of union and become a mere accumulation of experiences, and insecurity would be a structural part of the constitution of the postmodern subject , as he writes in Liquid Fear. Bauman is often described as a pessimist in his critique of Postmodernity.\n\nDigital Watercolor Vector Illustration made in Adobe Photoshop, 1200x1200px, 200dpi, JPEG, 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXZZWSugoKxz8KTgoktDVqsRwXj1rDXhGyACqjFcW1ViQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7uhvCd9HLmnLrrnDiXSXgnubiJYxB3hohMPgZMhwUmr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXZZWSugoKxz8KTgoktDVqsRwXj1rDXhGyACqjFcW1ViQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KfkkjyoJ4amMbZmTh3trxvHK7yFMKFJwL"], "tags": ["liquidlove", "liquid", "love", "bauman", "objkt", "giveaway", "collectible", "hicetnunc", "maxuga", "socrates", "sartre", "humanism", "spirals", "existentialism", "inspiration", "philosophy", "jpeg", "digitalpainting", "vector", "collection", "beuavoir", "platon", "socrates", "sexy", "fear", "zygmount", "psych"], "extra": {}}
