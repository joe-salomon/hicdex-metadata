This is fan art by AI...\n\nThe odd thing about artificial intelligence painting is that we cannot deny the biases. Luckily, Mindy can be painted, but this AI research took a lot of time to find a woman related to NFTs or crypto. Note: Mindy Kaling just recently joined the NFT community...\n\nMany \"famous\" men in crypto and NFTs can be painted by AI easily, but the closest AI could get to a woman leader in crypto was Tiffany Hayden in tests, and it was not very accurate. Because of Mindy Kaling's screen presence (an assumption), AI can obviously figure out how to paint her. This study highlights how artificial intelligence is biased because of a biased society, and the data we share is how AI perceives who and what is important. This also poses a question about privacy. Artificial intelligence appears to know too much about people's appearances. Obviously, celebrity photos are all over the web, so you can argue that celebrities have given up privacy, but is this right or wrong? I cannot answer these questions, but will it not be scary to type your own name into an AI model and see what will be painted or even animated...???", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbZp7CQMiEEhzRTDmhUF11JAAXkHMJ4YtQCcCmEAdsmU5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTa9kxiv5Mp49hRgx5C7pDLSk9PCZGrjQAaDfBXUXeQdf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbZp7CQMiEEhzRTDmhUF11JAAXkHMJ4YtQCcCmEAdsmU5", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YEd84t1fNqNsywZBmABgBDQD3cabmiN6N"], "tags": ["mindy", "kaling", "aiart", "generativeart", "generative", "moha", "gallery", "fineart", "mindykaling", "privacy", "bias", "biases", "ai", "animation", "deepfakes"], "extra": {}}
