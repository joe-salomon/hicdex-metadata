He had starred in the struggle of British India (present-day Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar) for their independence since 1919. For this he had developed the philosophy of non-violence and the techniques of passive resistance to achieve that the colonial authorities were forced to acknowledge their demands. After the Second World War he vigorously opposed the separate independence of Hindus and Muslims, as finally happened in August 1947, and the wave of violence that was shaking the entire country. Radical Hindu militant Nathuram Godse shot him three times as he headed to his daily morning prayer meeting. More than a million people attended his cremation.\n\nDEFEAT is a collection based on people whose death historically had an impact on power, quite remarkable in history, either by homicide, convictions or natural deaths, these people marked the beginning, or the end of a corrupt era within universal history.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcmMBX5t3GU6qVTEzQW5J9p5eES7KdCyH7TvtWaQPFmmS", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmde6GcZ9GUoUpSp3WYwZg9dhjjVeBYkwn3aaYfco2RRYY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcmMBX5t3GU6qVTEzQW5J9p5eES7KdCyH7TvtWaQPFmmS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eCSidkZBu6nXnmAzAqGZvbUER7xBCitzf"], "tags": ["pixel", "assassination", "illustration", "art", "defeat", "magnicidio", "arte", "digital", "collection"], "extra": {}}
