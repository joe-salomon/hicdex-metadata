The river still as can be, created a mirror for the dramatic canyon walls. A slow breeze worked its way through the Pine trees. The morning light danced on top of the forest as it works its way into the valley. If I had to paint the perfect morning, it would look just like this. The magic of Yosemite never seems to wear off. Sunrise is earlier than most choose to wake, but dawn always finds a way to color the woods in their richest tones. It's the perfect place to get away. The ideal place to disconnect. The escape we all long for. A perfect reminder that the world is as colorful as you choose to see it.
