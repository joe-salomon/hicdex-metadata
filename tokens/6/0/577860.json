One of the efforts that are expected to support coastal cleanliness is the existence of pro-active efforts from community elements. In this visual, I want to convey a message, the importance of awareness of the cleanliness of the coastal environment for the surrounding community and tourists as well as providing an understanding to the public that the waste produced has a negative impact on the development of biota and island ecosystems.\nThe broom fish as a fish icon that moves by swiping its body in a certain place so that the place that is pasted becomes clean, appears in this work as a reminder to us, the importance of keeping the beach clean.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaeu7ZVM1qM8mq384ctqgqYFCNKyBHxHqUvdrnthcqGLG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTPE6jtqGVb7ney3F5Nw59c7859RGL3FfnRM4QuA5sqeM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaeu7ZVM1qM8mq384ctqgqYFCNKyBHxHqUvdrnthcqGLG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2TrVp7QBwfWLCbLe4Qko7qcS7G9gLaoHSK"], "tags": ["Illustration", "beachclean", "wave"], "extra": {}}
