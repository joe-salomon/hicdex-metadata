The reproduction is a beautiful object of the early twentieth century and is therefore in fact an antique find in itself. A find that represents an older find, which in turn represents the timeless icon of classic femininity. The head was scanned with a photogrammetry device, then processed in a 3D environment and remapped with new imaginative, lush, and colorful textures, all deriving from my original freehand or digital drawings.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYGhmWQcgE8B9RjkUNQVee39wLXH5tLnYSKbo6umMu8qB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNeCzUV3Ro4fbz3UsxdF5udjx5c7mg1XWRuUSZrCi6BKC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYGhmWQcgE8B9RjkUNQVee39wLXH5tLnYSKbo6umMu8qB", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1amsgMaX2kYNLHMttB26Rf1EXmy5eJAwZG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dsculpture", "sculpture", "3dscan", "3dmodel", "virtualsculpture", "virtualreality"], "extra": {}}
