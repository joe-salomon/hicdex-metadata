The portraits do not represent evil, but rather are intended to ward off evil like gargoyles on a cathedral.\n\nCollect these portraits and hang them in your home or workplace to protect you against evils and to remind you that you can overcome your personal demons no matter how many or how frightening they might be.\n\nJanke Fienddie is particularly suited to warding off and protecting against the evils of egocentricity, kicking against the pricks, and obsessing.\n\nhttps://demons.johndilworth.com/#/S1VPRVhDWFFPNDFCMC0wMzBiZGItamFua2UtZmllbmRkaWUtMA==", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmauHqUKU39FcM3TtYZxr4AAzMBFEv3j1HtmeBztEaxsJC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmauHqUKU39FcM3TtYZxr4AAzMBFEv3j1HtmeBztEaxsJC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmauHqUKU39FcM3TtYZxr4AAzMBFEv3j1HtmeBztEaxsJC", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1M9TgQbP8oNWaV45X6aBznmMTRHv5HdB7b"], "tags": ["knotworkindustries", "johndilworth", "faceyourdemons", "demon", "NTWRK", "art", "illustration", "design"], "extra": {}}
