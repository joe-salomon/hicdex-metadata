But that beauty has been sculpted by change: the soft, almost imperceptible change, and the sudden and violent change. There is no place in the cosmos that is safe from change. \"\n\"We are a way for the universe to know itself. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star stuff\", \"The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in apple pies\u2026 all were created inside stars that collided with each other. We are made from the material of stars\" Carl Sagan.\nThe James Webb telescope is about to be launched. 100 times more powerful than Hubble promises to go further than imagined. It will open our eyes to a new universe. Authentic cosmic beauties await us in inhospitable regions, closer to the past. How do you imagine that moment when we will discover that we are not alone? Very soon.\nBetween 2017 and 2019, some twitter bots, @pixelsorter (\u2020) / by Way Spurr-Chen- @botisionista / by sebadelprado - @ FFD8FFDB (\u2020) / by Derek Arnold -, created and exchanged more than 85 thousand images.\nThese collectibles, intended as stela / plinth, are created from his works. With this project and this collection I rescued a moment that continues to make me reflect on art, creation / creator and the new speed that the present has.\n\nTwitter account @ Solibot1", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVEfMJKizTjq8Bxaqw4ajY713kKSY3ReZVWUyojykbeeZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX5rQQ6oMgHWhwz3d3nv2bXhe58SPrsNZH14jWnhAS24E", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVEfMJKizTjq8Bxaqw4ajY713kKSY3ReZVWUyojykbeeZ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1cSDieadCscchDugwQT3ZFCZkuarNMJDLZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "3dart", "glitch", "twitterbots", "pixelsorter", "socket", "abstract", "glitchart", "digitalart", "mtgcollector", "NFT", "Blockchainart", "nfts", "cryptoart", "NFTcollectables", "cryptotraders", "frame", "pixel", "cinema4d", "3d", "line", "cube", "fog", "telescope", "jameswebb", "alien", "universe", "carlsagan", "scifi", "metaphysics", "material", "cosmos", "render", "CGI", "crystals", "transparency", "fullcolors", "arnoldrender", ""], "extra": {}}
