I do not welcome you to this space. If you were an politician or goverment, people would be ashamed to be photographed with you. \n\nSo here is my MIC DROP. 100 editions ... will burn after 24 hours. This will be rare. \n\nHP LoveBux ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcAXYKW5SY6qWnttz1zdGub5JkaRvM2wXDgvvjkQNjZiH", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1t9xPfjpd3P9MD2d71HTgzui22q5FfYwq3u6zrsTadU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmbbRLD3mfpEXXwm2rqndEQL2AyxEqzhULoX6bbqJ3qhP3", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcAXYKW5SY6qWnttz1zdGub5JkaRvM2wXDgvvjkQNjZiH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Nh672Ln1KRwVgXVdS6NR3NcSWjUSPaFuB"], "tags": ["Editions:100Royalties:25.0%Tags:pepsi", "nft", "corporate", "cocacola", "coke", "burger", "king", "mic", "drop", "popart", "satire"], "extra": {}}
