Why should we then go to waste and not on top of platters placed?\n\nHeel and toe we\u2019ll use for soup, peel the skin, wash the poop. Scoop the brains into a ball, make them really really small.\nBreast and chests we\u2019ll save the best, have them dressed in herbs for guests\n\n\"If they knock for your arrest, let it go I would suggest.\"\n\nAfter all these meaty suits are not that different from the fruits: they both prime and they both rot, you can put them in a pot. \u2028Cold or hot! Medium rare! The recipes that we share! Use your body, use your hair! Use the parts you have to spare!\n\n\u2028It\u2019s not a trend like avocado, the ancient art of the asado. You might end up coronado and be the one descuartizado. \u2028Have a prize for you size, for your beauty, or your thighs! You might be worth a higher price if we could only disguise the flies.\n\nServe them, serve them, serve them all! Be the cherry of the ball! Let us market parts of you: \u201cLook out there, there\u2019s a queue!\u201d Lend your body for the stew cause their hunger only grew! Lend you body, oh you fool, you are our star, you are our fuel!\n\nKILL COUNT +10", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUHYM9wVcewcXvgTbVMxZvkhTRJhQ2T4Z24BvVL6ErBFL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRiMj1f89tFMRB8CFiFWYC6DW3m12efbDbnrrXTfuP4cy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUHYM9wVcewcXvgTbVMxZvkhTRJhQ2T4Z24BvVL6ErBFL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1aQKoJYGJTZRNDjunJVuPmJeZPKsrRvpBZ"], "tags": ["3d", "blender", "illustration", "story", "death"], "extra": {}}
