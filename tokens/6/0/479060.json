A metaverse like no other.\n\nThe second replaced reality. All consciousness, the last shred of soul, were all converted into bits. \n\nThe third wave saw the collapse.

Bits and pieces of meta-reality.\n\n// loopymoon // 2021\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmauKcpA9jG8S9tqqFLnZheGjAyBhJdTojqvBstf9wPVww", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRQUv1EZURqoWrbxJ5n1vuRGr9w8rrRGsuKPa7qSn7twN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmauKcpA9jG8S9tqqFLnZheGjAyBhJdTojqvBstf9wPVww", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iiMWaRHGLTqawxnSMBYZmJ2byCBUBS3Vr"], "tags": ["gan", "loopyverse", "singularity", "metareality", "onchain", "consciousness", "metaverse", "monochrome"], "extra": {}}
