With the following caption: \n\nI was recently interviewed and asked what \"the secret to my success\" has been in life. And, I realized that a big part of it has been that, despite what culture, schooling, and most of my upbringing has taught me, I've learned to EMBRACE AND LOVE FAILURE! Failure is one of our greatest allies. It is here to support us. It is the pathway to our collective success. So, please: FAIL JOYFULLY! LEAP INTO THE VOID AND THE NET WILL APPEAR! YES GODDESS!!!
