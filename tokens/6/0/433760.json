What he did not expect is for his companion to be a demon. His professors are definitely going to fail him now.\n\nHello! Thank you for taking your time to read Arche! It's a story I've been working on since July and is part of a larger narrative that's been on my mind since 2015. The story follows Noah on his last year at a magic school called Nymphaea. All he wants is to graduate, but unbeknownst to him, he is tied to a plot that will either save or destroy the world as he knows it.\n\nI've posted 14 episodes of Arche on tapas.io where I\u2019ve recently reached 600 subscribers thanks to the site featuring me twice. I plan to mint this weekly and I hope you guys also stay with me and watch as my art style improves over time. Thank you again for taking your time to read this! \n\nLot\u2019s of love, \nFei\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcuwgaC9pNmWMoky3sHUSnK3VPXKbffnbKLJaPL9cS9km", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1ztTFaHDfBBzG17nBHn7ZDQU7maLRTop1dWdz8TSKEh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcuwgaC9pNmWMoky3sHUSnK3VPXKbffnbKLJaPL9cS9km", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2BFvEhAFWVgh4B6sEnXEx7VFZYJTwegQHm"], "tags": ["arche", "webcomic", "webtoon", "video", "manga", "anime", "magic", "school", "story"], "extra": {}}
