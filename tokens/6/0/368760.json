I am a very frequent daydreamer and I tend to go so deep into my thoughts that I forget the physical world around me exists, and not always at the most appropriate times. But it's weird that the real world might not be as big of a part in our everyday lives as we may think, and a very large part of our waking lives we just spend wrapped up in our own minds. \n\nThis piece was digitally painted by me, including every frame of the animation. You can see some of the beginning process on my instagram account (@iamsphere) and my twitter account (@I_am_Sphere).\n\n{3003x3003}\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVJhYQ4kDTWDMhc95MjRXHU98SkgcfXNPKZR8cYpPmepW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVJhYQ4kDTWDMhc95MjRXHU98SkgcfXNPKZR8cYpPmepW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVJhYQ4kDTWDMhc95MjRXHU98SkgcfXNPKZR8cYpPmepW", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YUVJLYpxehCQskw5LJTY8oQNuX6Q4w6tw"], "tags": ["Girl", "woman", "animation", "GIF", "thinking", "realism", "painting", "blue", "contemplation", "hair", ""], "extra": {}}
