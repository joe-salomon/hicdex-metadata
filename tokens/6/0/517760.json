Smear it out and scratch in some shapes.\nSkill: low\nTime: <1h\nSecrets: Muddy colour? Fix it in post!\nComments: A reasonably fun way to salvage a disaster into something different. The effect is quite nice, and painting on a rough background gives lots of free detail. No nuanced brushstrokes required either - pick some cool colours, scrape in some stick figures and hope it looks artsy. Not one I'll hang on my wall.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQeREvzQJegNJ14SpiJL7aQ5eTVfFJGt7JbZyG6F4yGMN", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb7pCSQxEcBqru4Un29aXVYQTSpGLN9Wag2mojv7b1X9s", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQeREvzQJegNJ14SpiJL7aQ5eTVfFJGt7JbZyG6F4yGMN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UsG8NJtNCAtSkJLN4a1zcgFd9yzfpGeQZ"], "tags": ["oil", "canvas", "scratch"], "extra": {}}
