Weep with me is an invite to cry and be sad together with me. The photographs in this series were taken in a time where I was in a really bad place and emotional time in my life and I want to look at it as a reminder that I was strong enough to get through things and even managed to take a beautiful outlook on it. I want anyone that enjoys this series to see what I saw, the ugly and the beauty of the game of life. Weep with me is a love song, it's a heartfelt movie, it's a realism painting, it's a handwritten diary, it's a scream for help, it's getting over your ex, it's a cheap wine in a bad situation, it's a celebration of life, it's the fleeting moments in life, it's my life through my eyes.\n\nTaken on 35mm film", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmefF47G6ujq4rdLmJxokL87s5YEN4jLdfg17G7h3GJTdR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdoaZ5HFZerHGoRN1P3WkRH7QRr7KFmSrFyZhKeEcbh8j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmefF47G6ujq4rdLmJxokL87s5YEN4jLdfg17G7h3GJTdR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2P3xMVDdPE1JhxZiytAHSX44AQPhu6Wjs6"], "tags": ["35mm", "bw", "photography"], "extra": {}}
