Collage and composition of analog drawings (one from 2015) and digital illustration. \n\nFor many years I have had a huge fascination with different animal archetypes and especially monkeys have been featured in many of my works. They are complex creatures with multitudes of aspects and therefore have been richly respresented in different legends and stories. \n\nThis work draws on the Chinese story of Wukong \u2013 the monkey king. He is said to have possesed majestic powers of transformation and transmutation and was certainly a challenge to anyone who tried to control or discipline him. For me he represents the rebellious and playful spirit that does not allow itself to be imprisoned by conventions and arbitrary hierarchies. He has a chaotic and yet immensely loveable character, which makes him a fascinating creature. In this work, Wukong is in the process of contemplating and understanding his powers.
