It's such a challenge that it's a void that you can't fill even if you're in heaven. Nausea, crying attacks. Maybe it will seem strange to you that I share this, but believe me, there are a lot of people who are fighting for existence with this. My only wish is that you know that you are not alone. And hold on very tight to the things that make you feel most secure. I love you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTP9iFxa5ZxQkrtnVi9dLXZ6tzWzzUKpHQMsd2BmvtPiP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVKo8PXbHYkchFFMT9yNGpuMPtkhbQsQhk4DigCTF9SrF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTP9iFxa5ZxQkrtnVi9dLXZ6tzWzzUKpHQMsd2BmvtPiP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1X8tdMUnJZtMtQQdcfPbcEeLmfZZ7ybUpM"], "tags": ["Art", "Nft", ""], "extra": {}}
