I got locked at home, forbidden to go ourside by my parents. They said, \"it was for my best.\" Yes, it was a best way to cast away your friends. Only things i can do, is play with toys, watching a cartoons, then there is a colorfull team fought a bad things and SAVE peoples lives, called POWER RANGERS. I got envy about that. They got a relationship as a friend to do team work or kind a things.\n\nSo, there is first path of God is came. My father brought me two things, its a PENCIL and PAPER. He tought me to do things by that stuff, especially DRAWING.\n\nBy that moments, i do realize, you dont have to wear colorfull suit to save peoples lives. Just aware to surrounds, care to arounds. I think thats what my father do, SAVE his childhoods lives from lonelly.\n\nand here i am now, couple decades after that moments, mint a DRAWING on this flatform. For what ? to reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds, reminds about how that rangers saved me.\n\n-\nMonokromokey", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSx2BCtZrD1LMWdRtK5Sv5EySHc1aKzKFdrP6CGUpKGJH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNa5a2bgerpKC9JjeKFHQ7uwJfpdGJq7C89khXDmjQ7KY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSx2BCtZrD1LMWdRtK5Sv5EySHc1aKzKFdrP6CGUpKGJH", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1UVsSCA4xYqASiNQKNmfUonz3FjZYShBhK"], "tags": ["monokromonkey", "father", "digitaldrawing", "powerrangers", "illustrations", "rangers", "child", "childhoods", "savelife"], "extra": {}}
