Please Stand By, For Your Punishment. Inspired partly by the film US by Jordan Peele, which Peele described as a film that looked to comment on the \u201cramifications of privilege,\u201d I believe it\u2019s only a matter of time before the underprivileged and exploited rise up and \u201cfight back\u201d for a better life in the same way the tethered did in US. Hopefully the privileged will be prepared for the punishment they\u2019ll receive.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQfwBKmZLSo27ZbXDoEKDiAPwSuKi8g8U2qkSFiQQYJNG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ6S4trdEAMjCPVapP3YUpyRdx218EexkTWbidRiC7eLc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQfwBKmZLSo27ZbXDoEKDiAPwSuKi8g8U2qkSFiQQYJNG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
