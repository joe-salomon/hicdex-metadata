Women, especially young women, receive an astonishingly disproportionate amount of harassment online ranging from comments on appearance to threats of rape and violence. In this series, I attempt to explore this issue by contrasting some of the malicious comments I\u2019ve received with self-portraits. The portraits, or \u201cselfies\u201d, are recreations of the original images that the harassing comments were addressing. With this simple gesture, I intend to demonstrate the cruelness of the comments while exposing and examining this phenomenon. \"\n\n\nAfter posting this project on my tumblr blog in January 2014, the response was overwhelming. It received over 112,000 notes and was then written about by BuzzFeed, Good Morning America , Huffington Post , The Daily Mail, The Baltimore Sun, Glamour, Seventeen, Mic, MTV and more.\n\nThis project has also been featured in a number of gallery shows including: Social Media, A Space, Commerce, TX; By Women, For Everyone, Sager Braudis Gallery, Columbia, MO; Watchmen: Surveillance and the Flaneur, Torrance Art Museum, Torrance, CA; Gender/Power/Space, Lewis & Clark College, Portland, OR; Gutsy ,Gallery CA, Baltimore, MD \n\nOriginal viral post: https://lindsaybottos.tumblr.com/post/74655662316/some-new-stuff-im-working-on-i-get-tons-of", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWx3oKAs6k6ocs4aAGZfkSCsE2dqnGdsZ8NkLvnCkARoW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNnSTe5swhGZvVVVH8cA6g8Krnqn3u8NHiiaHfy8LsUKh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmaQY6Vtt9jiMoKJAWtQhheRjMVJsBchZAkxgx5r3Cbsut", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWx3oKAs6k6ocs4aAGZfkSCsE2dqnGdsZ8NkLvnCkARoW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aMXtNyxLZwVZhqaiJWoDSTVobC3eYbKVm"], "tags": ["Tumblr", "viral", "anonymous", "anon", "netart", "webart", "selfportrait", "selfie", "feminism", "feminist", "feministart", "Photobooth", "apple", "Mac", "webcam", "camgirl", "women", "woman", "female", "girl", "egirl", "e-girl", "nonbinary", "non-binary", "gender", "genderqueer", "queer", "bullying", "harassment", "internet", "textart", "photography", "2014", "buzzed", "huffpost", "mtv", "goodmorningamerica", "galleryart", "lindsaybottos", "lindsay"], "extra": {}}
