This piece is from the collection of glyphs that feature through the story.\n\nGlyph 999 is one of the most potent tools a Mahjuti practitioner can acquire. In essence a Glyph is a hack into the metaphorical operating system of the Reality Mesh. The technology behind the creation and use of glyphs is too extensive to explain here. In simple terms, however, it requires that the Mahjee who constructs or wields the glyph must be meticulous in its creation. The slightest error can generate unintended ripples of cause and effect that may return to the Mahjee in unexpected and sometimes disastrous ways.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP2GEj3D7JfVqTomBTdjtHWQyJJQ61LTgZpzj1udspJQR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP2GEj3D7JfVqTomBTdjtHWQyJJQ61LTgZpzj1udspJQR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP2GEj3D7JfVqTomBTdjtHWQyJJQ61LTgZpzj1udspJQR", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QgkEnqqsRDcrC6W77SPvjCgzPFNGfNweB"], "tags": ["glyphs", "veilofthegods", "graphicnovel", "magick"], "extra": {}}
