Her bedroom window and bedroom were completely visible from my kitchen. I never once looked over for months when I lived there, until she left the blinds open and had a gentleman caller come over. What then ensued was the poem you're reading. Who knows what the actual story was between the two of them, but that was better than any video you would find on basic cable. It was so compelling, I couldn't move. I couldn't stop watching. Was I a bad person? No, way! You all would have been doing the exact same thing. Yes, even you. I see you shaking your head like, not me. Yup, even you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVA7QA8ZuKCaD4xQoA18EDh4iQESLeXgsEdaewparc23g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQLiFNhSZDCwSZCbbwvJkuNfGsjCJVci59mKVVzsXhLhA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVA7QA8ZuKCaD4xQoA18EDh4iQESLeXgsEdaewparc23g", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
