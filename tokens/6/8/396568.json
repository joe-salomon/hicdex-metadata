Another way English is fascinating is when we look at spacing and placement to create context in English. The words WHO and HOW are anagrams of each other and only 1 letter placement from one another. One needs the W at the front and the other needs the W at the end. By overlapping the W's and repeating the words we create a scenario where the reader will be confused by which word we're supposed to be emphasizing to gain context or understanding. A visual way to see this would be to say does this say : WHO WHO WHO W or W HOW HOW HOW or WHO W HOW HOW or any of the other possible variations. And you call this art? Yes because the underpinnings of how letters combine with the glue of grammar, we can begin to see the potential of how form and structure can be celebrated in language as art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeStv1282pb2VZpPoNTRzZoK25RfEu6BVMknR6SN4CXvM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY9xnHm271v3SggsWBC6XRBC55APLR7yfLHfkjWSBaBhs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeStv1282pb2VZpPoNTRzZoK25RfEu6BVMknR6SN4CXvM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
