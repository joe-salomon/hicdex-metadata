First I laid down the background with large strokes with my face with an old mobile version of Handsfree.js through the Autodesk Sketchbook app. Any large swaths of paint were done with face gestures, as well as the underline of the word Handsfree.js. The rest was done with stylus since I'm still developing my style. This is a first in a series of Handsfree.js made NFTs, and the idea is to eventually do the whole thing hands-free. Here's an old video clip which shows the process: https://vimeo.com/572664890", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXtCarmec65UH6r89bgFFKnfr3LhsSDApRxw3dq9HUh4s", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYAJFhFk3WMF1US54EWjGww2pFL1X6XoFd4dxNiMxZM1M", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXtCarmec65UH6r89bgFFKnfr3LhsSDApRxw3dq9HUh4s", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iiYYsGEvf6RUZzxf9DU3u7hEKvwYEpSNf"], "tags": ["handsfree", "doodle", "sketchbook"], "extra": {}}
