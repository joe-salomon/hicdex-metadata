All artworks are created using custom algorithms in processing.\nThis collection has an abstract look at Iranian carpets, Iranian art-industrial carpets that have long overshadowed Iranian culture as a name and credit for Iran.\nThe ancient city of Nahavand in western Iran is one of Iran's leading rug-proveniences. It produces high-quality Persian rugs, which have a very good reputation.\n\nUsually, very shiny wool is used, which gives the patterns and design of the carpet a strong personality. The robust carpets have a rectilinear design, partly inspired by nomadic rugs. A central center medallion sets the tone in many cases. It is decorated with leaf, flower, and branch motifs. It is framed by floral patterns that are stylized. Vases, for example, are a popular motif. The beautifully combined colors mostly consist of red and beige tones, which unfold on a blue background.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRykgfHYifQZGvyAX7DdjcvXWfE5Eoero4uzyQP23RGwH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRykgfHYifQZGvyAX7DdjcvXWfE5Eoero4uzyQP23RGwH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRykgfHYifQZGvyAX7DdjcvXWfE5Eoero4uzyQP23RGwH", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SSCjgL54U5yUemQVFGfZ9M9ygKHLHgNsA"], "tags": ["generativeart", "creativecoding", "generative", "codeart", "abstract", "creativecodeart", "algorithmicart", "touchdesigner", "loop", "artificialintelligencegenerativedesign", "processing", "mathart", "CODING", "proceduralart", "procedural", "bhfyp", "geometry", "pattern", "GEOMATIC", "aiart", "artxcode", "minimal", "psychedelic", "glsl", "psychedelicart", "opart", "genartclub", "noise", "trippy", "artandtechnology", "coding", "pyton", "p5js", "pixel", "shahrokh", "machinelearning", "particle", "subtle", "eyegasm", "dithering", "vqgan", "goop", "gan"], "extra": {}}
