Going up the mesa during the day time can be very misleading. It was warm and sunny, during the day but it gets blistering cold at night. Temperatures dropped from 70 degrees fahrenheit to 20 degrees at night. I was freezing my ass off while shooting. But it was worth it. As soon as nighttime started you can see the whole night sky in all its glory. The darker the sky the more stars you can see. It was an absolute dream.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcB5tdvyVZGhQ5LT7o2Ve8QfHPav1cUg3vM9CntjkhN6c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeeNP62iFnksjtq4hYjeyzmxxKdHuwbm7CcpdmCsKfNHN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcB5tdvyVZGhQ5LT7o2Ve8QfHPav1cUg3vM9CntjkhN6c", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1N7dWhkNSpUY8uqWJi2wFPBsDRMFnSsid3"], "tags": ["Reflection", "astrophotography", "milkyway", "stars", "nft", "photography", "mountains", "colorado", "grandmesa", "landscape"], "extra": {}}
