There is no limit on how much time we dedicate in social networks, to our followers, to our haters, and especially to fulfill our ego with infinite likes and flattering comments. The daily dose we take keeps growing without limits like drug tolerance in drug addicts. Meanwhile the real people around us, our friends and family are becoming less interesting and pushed to a second plane. No more talking, only messages, fear to be us, fear to show who we really are, until we slowly strangle it and sacrify it.
