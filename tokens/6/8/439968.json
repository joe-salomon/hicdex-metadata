Until now, it was difficult to imagine the value of digital art and the possibility of selling it by auction type, even online. This is a revolution that came to us with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.\nI can internally compare it to electronic music made on a laptop using virtual instruments in a quiet corner in the suburbs with only 2G reception. Unbelievable! Opportunities like that.\nI think the market is growing and will grow exponentially. New branches will emerge and digitalization will touch, if not everything, then almost everything. It's a question of demand and timing.\nI would like to see lettering take its place in this context and get new forms and implementations.\nPeace, Labor, NFT!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPjZMtM3WuiGR927kfCrfF1GUrHGQfbLqhwoFEFtPRgMP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbipsxGoebfKuaCET8TBAwP94XWwFDrqMBt9mqRL8D7Vh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPjZMtM3WuiGR927kfCrfF1GUrHGQfbLqhwoFEFtPRgMP", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cgT6gJt2YBBP4R9vnSYBaxre8E3PNk6wn"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
