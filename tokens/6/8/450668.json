Rather than two beams passing through one-another, they splash on contact since they can only have a unique velocity at each cell. Emissive red material is deposited where things have passed and indicates the 'Physarum-like' term which drives things into tendrils and lines. Ultimately the organization of the system into churning red tangles takes over the overall effect. / @ngutten\n\n1024 x 1024 mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbeEXYijzCvaNRGbMfUvNZDQ8JcFXEkEy92MeSwhCc7L1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaM5RhJdNjC5hmwLZ95qv1K6yA67DV6q2CXPxFrJkkaVq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbeEXYijzCvaNRGbMfUvNZDQ8JcFXEkEy92MeSwhCc7L1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["3d", "video", "simulation", "generative", "light", "glowy", "physarum", "advection", "cellularautomaton"], "extra": {}}
