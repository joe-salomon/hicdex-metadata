The full moon on a summer evening is distorted by the heat rising from a crackling campfire. On the fire, popcorn bursts. With each burst, the moon dances.\n\n23 years after producing \u2018Camp\u2019, the promise of what summer brings has changed. \u2018HALO III\u2019 presents a bright red solar eclipse known as a \u201cring of fire\u201d. Embers float around and smoke swirls. \n\nPast, present and future, the HALO trilogy references the significant feedback loop we are now in after decades of warnings. Campfires are now banned in the summer in British Columbia (where I live). With severe, extended droughts being the new normal,  the risk of wildfire is extreme. Compounding the threat, 2021 produced record temperatures reaching a staggering 49.6C, smashing the previous record by 4.6C. It is set to be the 3rd worst fire season on record, all of which were recorded within the last 5 years.
