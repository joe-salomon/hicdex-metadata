I have no pride, I have no shame, you gotta make it rain. Since you gone, deep inside it hurts. I'm just another sad guest on this dark earth, I want to believe in the mercy of the world again. Make it rain, make it rain. The nite's too quiet stretched out alone, I need the whip of thunder and the winds dark moan. I'm not Able, I'm just Cain, open up the heavens, make it rain. I'm close to heaven, crushed at the gate, they sharpen their knives on my mistakes. What she done you can't give it a name, just make it rain. With out her love, with out your kiss hell can't burn me more than this. I'm burning up all this pain, open up the heavens, make it rain. I'm born to trouble, I'm born to fate, inside a promise I can't escape. It's the same old world, but nothing looks the same. I stayed alone here, make it rain.\n\nOil, canvas, madness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNnzSEwmhS4EUBSAcYJB6dRtLhqBmjrsjZ9jJBxKsMExn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNnzSEwmhS4EUBSAcYJB6dRtLhqBmjrsjZ9jJBxKsMExn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNnzSEwmhS4EUBSAcYJB6dRtLhqBmjrsjZ9jJBxKsMExn", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ccAo4Gkpk76mXMBmBMfUpEZSRA7fERBr9"], "tags": ["darkart", "dark", "art", "scull", "skeleton", "cemetery", "glitch", "gif", "tezos", "art"], "extra": {}}
