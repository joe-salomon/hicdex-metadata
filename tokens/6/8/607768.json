Over the course of three days, he dropped three unique paintings of Paul Reuschel pregnancy portraits.   Editions were /133 for .333tz, /69 for .69tz and /33 for 1.33tz.\n\nAfter the sold out drops were completed it was announced that a collector would need to burn all three editions to obtain a key card in the Series 3 chase.  Thus, an unannounced Future Utility made its first appearance in thr33som3s.\n\nSince that first burn (during which 22 of the 33 #DTB3 were burned) Dad to Bes have been involved in 3 other specific limited Utilities.  They are, truly, some of the most important thr33som3s in existence.  \n\nThis thr33smas version is a new painting of those original mints.\n\nThe 12 Days of thr33smas is a chase 3v3nt.  Collect all 12, #3MAS1 through #3MAS12, in the announced timeframe to receive #3MAS13 via airdrop.\n\nThis card is an INSERT. It has all established Standard Insert Utility and may compound additional Utilities over time. It is a Painting Insert, a thr33smas Insert and a Holiday Insert. ***** digital capture of original painting, gouache on vintage baseball card, 2021. ************ NFT image is for personal use, no commercial rights are granted.
