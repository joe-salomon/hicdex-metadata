Great is also the number of anonymous artists. Artists in this country tend to have very controlled egos. Perhaps this is another effect of the vapors.\n\n*see OBJKT #245972", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTkpL2ubyPWErX2Lqykgss3xhmWJXJRB7p5joYauiBUyA", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc1sW4KpE9u1LWiqNPDukiVPRSngZ5iKAAVWxeWAyYNiL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTkpL2ubyPWErX2Lqykgss3xhmWJXJRB7p5joYauiBUyA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Lysergic", "Stamp"], "extra": {}}
