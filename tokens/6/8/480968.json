In the midst of technological and scientific progress promoted by Per\u00f3n's presidency. A group of professionals started an investigation on the use of psychedelics to look for changes in the perception and expansion of the workers' minds. The consumption of LSD, mescaline and ayahuasca was carried out in recreational spaces of the unions or in the factory yards. These exercises promoted a closer bond between workers, deepened sensitivity, empathy and cooperation with the poorest sectors and connected labor with intuition and artistic creativity.\nThis research led to the creation of the choritrip. A choripan combined with LSD that was consumed in mobilizations or popular meetings.  This connected workers on a more personal level.  It was common to hear improvised songs, dances or demonstrations of affection among workers.\nThese practices ended with the overthrow and exile of Peron.\n\n@PandaAndrez", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZp7N9dQZfMzHgw4sWoFbPi8yM2fBCfxiAL6f58YsAiSR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP6Z6itjmnQkRbRE4DN8uwbjGPP1pBNgPnnn64BwbM7MM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZp7N9dQZfMzHgw4sWoFbPi8yM2fBCfxiAL6f58YsAiSR", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QAbW5QD8vYLVgPt5jKxo84fgGrrdwpTqD"], "tags": ["Andrezpanda", "illustration", "animation", "history", "parody", "peron", "psychedelia", "psychedelia", "lsd", "trip", "acid", "mp4"], "extra": {}}
