During the creation process, I use filters for locating and enhancing interesting pixel structures. In this technically endless creation process, my role as an artist constantly shifts between initiator and observer. What are the properties of the snapshots that I decide to keep? How long can I follow the trail of pixels before I end up where I started again?
