At some point you had to shut off the TV because of the absolute garbage that Trump & Co. were putting out made you either want to smoke, drink, and/or self-medicate.

There comes a threshold of mental pain, similar to hitting yourself with a wooden board repeatedly, that listening to Donald Trump had on me that catapulted me into self-medication. It gave me the freedom to process information the way MY mind works, not how FOX News works.
