{"__version": 1, "token_id": 339568, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "AVOID SPACE / A VOID SPACE", "description": "Here is another example of a structural semantic phrase, this time it's not a contradiction, but actually a further definition within its own words and within the context of the social distancing of the COVID19 pandemic. We all have been told to be socially distant; alone, together and together, alone. As we collectively avoid space, it creates a void space. It's kind of a meta type word that it keeps referring back into and onto itself. Kind of like if you've ever been in Lucas Samar's mirror room or inside of one of Yayoi Kusama's wonderfully insane mirror rooms and you see yourself going into infinity. That's a meta type of eternal feedback words these are. They are rare and incredibly special. Sometimes if you have ever pondered the actual concept of infinity, it seems intangible or intelligible as we or should I say our consciousnesses are only in one spot at one time. It's almost impossible to conceive as we are like little flatlanders on a 2 dimensional world that can't see or perceive 3 dimensions. We are unable to perceive beyond that 3rd dimensional limitation...so far. All that from just 2 sentences that say the exact same thing with only one space added.
