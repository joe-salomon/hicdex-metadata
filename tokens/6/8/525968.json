It's interesting to see how even in Spanish there are words within words. We are able to see that the letters PO DE R overlap in the top line, thus when we combine all the words together. Depending on how you see history, one could argue that we are in the Golden Age of Power. More and more power is being consolidated in fewer and fewer hands around the world, which historically doesn't bold well for humanity's sake. How do we ensure democracy wins? How do we prevent oligarchism? How do we prevent the World from regressing politically / socially / economically / etc? Who can we trust? Is there even trust left in any systems?
