That one thing I did had the worst impact one me ever, I would say that I did it at such a bad timing. The feeling when I realised something I never thought of, it was like the fear I had actually came through. And I could do nothing except for accepting it. It made me realise the choices that I made, the things that I did that ended up making my thought getting messier and messier. And I could not escape from it. It could be that I was just being dramatic. But, at the point of me writing this at the moment, that thought there is still lingering in my mind. It does not go away and I keep thinking about it consciously and subconsciously. And I still do cry because of it, just not as much. Or maybe it might be because I am numb already.
