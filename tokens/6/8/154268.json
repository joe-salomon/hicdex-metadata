She was mostly granting wishes that'd help people find their lover. Free will being something she cannot tamper with, it'd mostly be wishes around superficial body manipulations, as well as some much needed guidance that came with the package. Some day, a thankful person wish was for her to be free from the lamp. At first she didn't quite know what to do. With time she found a passion for fitness : she shaped other people body and mind for so long, she almost found it natural. She now have her own gym, and still help people, but now it takes more blood, sweat and tears than back in the old Djinn's way.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQKiNRShxNYVi79R9Dvxehn9xw2GsV24FrmBQ2JV7mdEv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSMhwkE8YMNbdwjB2EgHMXTZndpjws7rxDE5g2teNxzdH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQKiNRShxNYVi79R9Dvxehn9xw2GsV24FrmBQ2JV7mdEv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fTZs8yQdVPzn56ygMmUTRmiLiLC8iFNtj"], "tags": ["colored", "genie", "demons", "dystopia", "fantasy", "djinn"], "extra": {}}
