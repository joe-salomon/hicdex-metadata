Gender, race, and even species become optional ways of representing ourselves.  As we explore these identities and what makes us unique in the metaverse, it becomes obvious that we have much more in common than the typical community. We are the first wave of digital denizens. AI Imagined Bored Ape 4/10 was painted by artonomous from a GAN trained on members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. A preference was given to Bored Apes that shared traits with CryptoPunks and thus the emergence of the beanie, 3D glasses, and pipe. Each artwork in this 10 portrait series explores a different aspect of CryptoArt and identity in the emerging metaverse.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcgBhuyDsS68XKqyPJc8NS3URQAuVCGUtwaNcWLT2WjdJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbL287pfJWKXE9ZWHKfSzq2fW59sS1HS1X9zGjfCsBjsF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcgBhuyDsS68XKqyPJc8NS3URQAuVCGUtwaNcWLT2WjdJ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XxKth27unh1zquuKNTehQhUr5M5CHPf3e"], "tags": ["AI", "ArtificialIntelligence", "BAYC", "BoredApe", "CreativeAI", "GAN", "PaintingRobot", "Portrait", "Robot", "RobotArt"], "extra": {}}
