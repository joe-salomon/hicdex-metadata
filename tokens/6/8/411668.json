It\u2019s quite unintentional. \n\nWith these experiments I decided to prioritise this light source, directing the creative process toward something more sculptural and less flat. \n\nBy seeing where subsequent \u2018shadows\u2019 fell I was able to give shape to the form that was being suggested. \n\nI love how surprising these pieces are. I find these abstract shapes really interesting and pleasurable so I thought I\u2019d share them. \n\nI\u2019ve used a flat colour ground as it suggests a quote from Yves Klein \u2018I have come to believe that there is a living world of each colour\u2026\u2019\n\nThe combination of individual light source and colour, for me, suggest a space other than the one we inhabit physically.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNNH6pf4q8jS4sXTSVnDXyaSsyfvj1qU16nRw2xWUmP1f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTarUtCxPNog9YV1i2nUEUc1VZckbEwk5YTcohNt3hmLY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNNH6pf4q8jS4sXTSVnDXyaSsyfvj1qU16nRw2xWUmP1f", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NHP2mmBNbagWLLnaKM3C1QCtmuk2Qjg26"], "tags": ["abstrktobjkt", "non-generative", "experiment", "fine-art", "colour", "light", "shade"], "extra": {}}
