{"__version": 1, "token_id": 603268, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MEMMMMMMMMORY", "description": "This work stemmed from an evening that I took copious amounts of cannabis edibles and began to drift into a fond memory of eating the most delicious baklava I ever had years ago in NYC. If you're from NYC, specifically Manhattan, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. There's a restaurant called: The Hummus Place, a Minimalist eatery for kosher Israeli vegetarian fare that specializes in many varieties of hummus. (Located at 305 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023) I lived in the neighborhood for about 3 years and would typically come here to have a simple lunch on my days off or for work. The food was just unreal, but you know what was incredible? The baklava. (Wait a second Andrew...this...this is your art?) You betcha, the baklava was so good that this memory became a memmory and then a memmmory and so on. The metaphor here is that the baklava was so good that memory drifted on for years in my mind. The delicious honey, the textured filo dough, the pistachios, and oh there were three different kinds of baklava in one serving; mind-blowing. It's been years since I've been there and I don't even know if they still have these types of baklava, but good god it was legendarily amazing.
