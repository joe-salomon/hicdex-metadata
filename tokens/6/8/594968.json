Samples that were taken from 50 years of making illustrations and graphic art, a little taste of what is to come. \n\nWORMS! A tribute to the glorious Pop Culture of the '90s. An era where fun is the most important thing in a science movie.  \n\nThis artwork is drawn by hand with pencil and pen on paper. Scanned & very lightly retouched.
