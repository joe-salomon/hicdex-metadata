The images of this collection are elaborated by compacting components of space, time and intention. The algorithm generate images by crushing cinematographic works. The generated image, a residual trace of time, synthesizes in a colorful atmosphere the history of the original movie. The process, like the mining of some crypto assets, need a long time of computer calculation and it's value can also be indexed on electrical energy.\n\nThis image is the residual trace of the movie \"Terminator: Judgment Day\" by James Cameron, 1991.\n\nImage properties: 6000x2500px, 150dpi, .png, printable\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQS3KsAeMdVHDFHkkXYaTRW6gYJsW1ZrJi4hqxxobw74o", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWFzLxQU84vFhPY87GrM6FNNsPquCvy7WMa28U9kEDxAV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQS3KsAeMdVHDFHkkXYaTRW6gYJsW1ZrJi4hqxxobw74o", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SzTsJNtuHjitQqchKko1n18o3NBVnCpGk"], "tags": ["algorithm", "remix", "color", "art", "image", "abstract", "generate", "movie", "digital"], "extra": {}}
