This then made me think about photography and polaroids. The most common 1/1 in photography. So with this collection I decided to merge both concepts and make it my own. Each NFT will be available as a 1/1 as a digital snapshot I have created from my own work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUwbyRfb23DHjCsMgcJKdLJr7axJtg2cdWtZpePKixAfy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcJyoaMvoW89N4ErQ4YXvDve61Ya2ib6BKQmWNw8ikKHx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUwbyRfb23DHjCsMgcJKdLJr7axJtg2cdWtZpePKixAfy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ecKRfFyXBCuSfniEMYuU1vZPT6jJCr2aj"], "tags": ["Infinite", "DigitalSnapshot", "nftphotography", "photography"], "extra": {}}
