He is everything that benefits whether Halal or Haram.\n\nAllah is Al Wahhab which means the great giver whose blessings are freely and perpetually given. He gives with no purpose and expects nothing in return. Allah is truly the most liberal giver, He gives to the deserving and undeserving, to the good and the evil.\n\nOr do they have the depositories of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might, the Bestower? (Quran 38:9)\n\nSay, \u201cIndeed, [all] bounty is in the hand of Allah \u2013 He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Wise.\u201d (Quran 3:73)\n\nHe said, \u201cMy Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, you are the Bestower.\u201d (Quran 38:35)\n\nYou only worship, besides Allah, idols, and you produce a falsehood. Indeed, those you worship besides Allah do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So, seek from Allah provision and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be returned.\u201d (Quran 29:17)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWRUVmDdJsTJUskaeb3eYbMukcaNhxrGWt4DMpwZuVaYs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPkB7MymtMzPUaPCci3tpv3DbjWoJkfK9PL3J479Jz4xt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWRUVmDdJsTJUskaeb3eYbMukcaNhxrGWt4DMpwZuVaYs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["islam", "god", "allah", "religion", "1of1", "asmaulhusna", "moslem", "asmaulhusnanft"], "extra": {}}
