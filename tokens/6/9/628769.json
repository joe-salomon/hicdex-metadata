I know I have a few bots stalking my drops thee days.  \n\nAgain this is not legal or financial advice, just my thoughts and suggestion to try or not to try if they work for you.  After your appointment you may sell or pass on the NFT to someone else and I will honor for each holder until June. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSWWz9NuuNyh1GQ6opDyKzGm4NMwSD2vi9ZCjPkRmvgWv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcWjojU28zpnuJUb1KUF792JBvjhnQ9Uz47H5F9XTkMjx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSWWz9NuuNyh1GQ6opDyKzGm4NMwSD2vi9ZCjPkRmvgWv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZfApCB1rmfyByn9e1jj1w9jLSY1wfu9dm"], "tags": ["advice", "consultation", "ticket", "tickets"], "extra": {}}
