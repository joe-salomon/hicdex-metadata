Pesugihan is derived from the Javanese word sugih meaning \"rich\". It is a kind of magic to help people become rich instantly, but in exchange they must sacrifice something. In this case they must sacrifice their humanity; allowing themselves to be transformed into a boar for a period of time, or allowing themselves to be possessed by a boar demon. The human-animal transformation is similar to shapeshifting or the werewolf concept in the West.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSwiFS4Ym8DJLSDLxu1queccStKEcX4imkTv71PCCMfzq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWb1uhMJ4zkxLiRjPF9VK35JJPCrRdkk19sBCjMhnpwak", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSwiFS4Ym8DJLSDLxu1queccStKEcX4imkTv71PCCMfzq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UG746QnTtFrNWwHFfbGosQcxwtJSRKev8"], "tags": ["babingepet", "horor", "mecha", "art", "illustration", "indonesia", "culture", "ghost", "mith", "Magic", "Blackmagic"], "extra": {}}
