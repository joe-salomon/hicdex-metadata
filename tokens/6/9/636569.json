By purchasing these works individually and in one place, you can support my idea and art to display my other collections, each of which has important ideas for promotion in the community.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUcQTt27gaRGSsBnn3q7wU8RwnNhpfZhopMWVpMLxRwp4", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf692q8uTZtXHoiDk6tQ4Dfcjy91uEU2stK5Ch3LuaJsw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmYjZHBGfsswJy4MDSeYVobhrWUtwfgmfeiguYNv6wE7Q9", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUcQTt27gaRGSsBnn3q7wU8RwnNhpfZhopMWVpMLxRwp4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2PbCcvTXpw17EEaLS3hnAktMG2pR993JHf"], "tags": [], "extra": {}}
