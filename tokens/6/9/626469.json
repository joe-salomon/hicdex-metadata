Her family doesn\u2019t seem to support her dream and as it stands, she hasn\u2019t been able to land a single successful audition anywhere. She refuses to give up though, her thoughts about her dream becoming more and more intense as she devotes every waking moment to finding success, maybe too intense even.\n\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different levels of scarcity. Gold Frames are very limited with the lowest initial mint rate of any frame color. All artworks will be compatible within the Gallery Gehenna Mobile Game with each artwork unlocking a playable segment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVeqcrUaTNuvmaRvu8QNkaSqomhVsg8vQwEX4m8AE8tbq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWRbwfyfjYur1MW2WXFRzLg2i2GEJDTqGQ82DrmXiDGMq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVeqcrUaTNuvmaRvu8QNkaSqomhVsg8vQwEX4m8AE8tbq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["GalleryGehennaProject", "GalleryGehenna", "GehennaProject", "Ballet", "Dancer", "BigBen", "BalletDancer", "Dance", "NeuralNetwork", "NeuralNetworkArt", "Utility", "Game", "Colorful", "Dream", "DeepDream"], "extra": {}}
