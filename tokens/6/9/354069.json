Support yourself, support your own magnificence, give it the time and space it needs to be expressed and bring it out into the world. Share your wisdom in your own way on your own terms. \nHealthy boundaries mean that you have the time and space for your own expression without anyone on the outside interfering with that. If we cannot learn how we express, at what pace and in what way it will not come out. You need to explore what space you need and how the shape of you is constructed to meet the outside world. It can be different and will shift with different people and situations. You get to decide who you spend your time with, what you spend your time doing and how you do it. What do you need to feel healthy, well, excited, rested, loved and fulfilled? \n\nWork out what makes you tick, the you that likes to play, the you who knows how much alone time you need. You know what fits for you if you give yourself the time to think about it and then what kind of a life will you create for yourself? \n\nHow do you want to connect with the world?\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNiQSYBKFopHxSPzUSwH1DTzWSVH8NjiTUvvYTUcRrVuQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQkawHLSXL4JTutr2t42ppmwspYnbtfVNyAQKzdD2tcbY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNiQSYBKFopHxSPzUSwH1DTzWSVH8NjiTUvvYTUcRrVuQ", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
