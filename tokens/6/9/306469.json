The end of so many things revealing a new beginning, a new lens through which to see. A sun still shines somewhere behind the haze. Now the green has now returned to the hillsides and fires have turned to floods and a virus. One could look out the window and see a planet vastly different to the one they arrived on at birth. But with new beginnings come the potential for something better. Though we may fall in despair, cursing the sky, at some point we must arise anew. As we create new tools and see things through this new lens, with love in our hearts and strength in our eyes; we can choose the direction of our compass, sail for better shores. It is all just a choice, just look to the sun.\"\n\nPhotography by Jay Moon, during the Australian wildfires; November 2019.\n#15 of 15.\nAll funds generated go toward the ongoing recovery.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPJxusUYKtpzQhcgWEe93pzULHNqiECzuYri4kK2CfU31", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaGQB947fu3RBCY5XGyXRhUXkEfgXUwqW6ZtkiWB29E89", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPJxusUYKtpzQhcgWEe93pzULHNqiECzuYri4kK2CfU31", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2G2NzfXg5JDLcCQxGmToT8goBBGPwo1dtj"], "tags": ["photography", "fire", "australia", "wildfires", "natural"], "extra": {}}
