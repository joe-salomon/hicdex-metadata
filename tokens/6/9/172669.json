Please Stand By, Freeing Britney, having been under her father\u2019s conservatorship for the past 13 years, Britney Spears hasn\u2019t had control of any aspect of her life for quite some time, including her decision to have more children. But increased media attention to her case has led to some promising advancements, including the ability to hire her own lawyer and maybe more importantly, politicians from BOTH sides of the aisle showing their support for the famed singer. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas on a recent podcast said \u201cI am squarely and unequivocally in the camp of #FreeBritney.\u201d Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Mass. excoriated the case as \u201cthe craziest\u201d he had \u201cseen in a long time. If Britney Spears can get Ted Cruz to agree with Democrats on something, is there anything she CAN\u2019T do? \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNjq7hG7UNaCxzhHEvNmQxNWmg4cGcDoqsfmvxjKDXQ4P", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWJkPyfe3Z5wRSqiEpGjcEtGhAnknh6XfCLHAJ6gbg3sE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNjq7hG7UNaCxzhHEvNmQxNWmg4cGcDoqsfmvxjKDXQ4P", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["digital", "art", "digitalart", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "TV", "loki"], "extra": {}}
