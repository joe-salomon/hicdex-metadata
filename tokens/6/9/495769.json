But some said in every person's heart; there's some devil reside, which may be these devils are a manifestation of his desire.\n\nIt was so unfruitful to have a mental state like this. It's not good for spiritual health.\n\nSome of my friends gave me a suggestion because he was astonished when we talked about some issues. They think that my perspective was so dark. It was like some discouraging atmosphere was peeking out from behind my back every time I talked.\n\nThe suggestion was straightforward, but it was so hard to do it. \"Embrace yourself with the present, holding on tight and enjoying it as a present too (Present as a time and opportunity to meet). Embrace everything that appears on your eyes.\"\n\nI think it's enough. It should be able to bury negative thoughts and reflections about the devil in my head.\n\nBut isn't it if we have evil thoughts with anyone that we also have become a devil?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWfz13x2xGtRg4u92n3GHrG8ggUXufjb3c5gHrMzcNG6W", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbHKJSypCDSxZ8fPuS3ptKGQAmKHQbUSBfGLXN9eRCftU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWfz13x2xGtRg4u92n3GHrG8ggUXufjb3c5gHrMzcNG6W", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hzAsBJzifph6288TAmwSZsW94pgK8fWAz"], "tags": ["Art", "Drawing", "Illustration", "Watercolor", "HENHalloween"], "extra": {}}
