Trying to capture the beauty and simplicity of natural movement with a minimal graphic style.\n\nThechnically this work is a grid of nodes that repel each other. Each node on each row is connected to its neighboor with a digital spring maintaining the equilibrium. Agents move around the canvas distirubing this equilibrium momentarily.\nYou can also move the mouse around the canvas.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRiLQfnfWR9LvhF1ubqZZPaZRXU6VaHLssDPeY5XkWuRW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfH58WG1WEATQ2erpv1gApVZnGT4QbnKpmv1w4BDo7Evw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRiLQfnfWR9LvhF1ubqZZPaZRXU6VaHLssDPeY5XkWuRW", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1dc2ub1J3jTRQQYWN1BPmL6mUjMKGfadDE"], "tags": ["generative", "interactive", "creativecoding", "p5js", "p5.js"], "extra": {}}
