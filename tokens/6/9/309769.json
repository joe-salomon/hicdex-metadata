Infused with his own chakra, Gaara controls this \"specially-made sand\" (\u7279\u5225\u88fd\u306e\u7802, tokubetsu-sei no suna) far easier than regular sand, though he can use this supply to break down the ground to increase the quantity of sand. The gourd and cork are also made from sand and can be broken down and used to perform techniques as well.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTcA31tPeA71Z3e6FTud9on31eRYcrLonGeEiXhFDoJA1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbcNPMAmqiqki2bLa3u3oXTvFiHYVPTktE2cYUMLYMDAs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTcA31tPeA71Z3e6FTud9on31eRYcrLonGeEiXhFDoJA1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1X4KxGvXc3R4Q7AuEE5uqNk8brsjDAkGKs"], "tags": ["abstraction", "objkt4objktiii", "animation", "animemuseum", "anime", "naruto", "objkt4objkt3", "objkt4objkt", "render", "character", "loop", "objkt4objktiii"], "extra": {}}
