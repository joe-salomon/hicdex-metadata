I should have gone to look for her when I longed for our meeting,  but I was afraid and I was not able to do it or to leave my family. The suffering, the sadness that for so many years I had inside me will now end, and death will finally come to look for me\n\nMp4 1536x2304", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWEGVeGdvKLVLwPag3DjfF6v5ZSsRUM69Yoa8aCTw7Rup", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRm5By2KxU3eVxp9njrjjsDt5buAwLHmKmjkmc5khuoJX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWEGVeGdvKLVLwPag3DjfF6v5ZSsRUM69Yoa8aCTw7Rup", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bGLZ314J6Sn8x6FPzy67KzscBrZ57Ma98"], "tags": ["art", "charcter", "characterdesing", "plasticine", "sculpture", "sculptor", "3d", "design", "artist"], "extra": {}}
