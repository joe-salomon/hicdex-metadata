It\u2019s amazing to know that people use it every day to send a kiss in chat, in posts, and stories.\n\n\u201cDuet\u201d captures the sweet trepidation and glowing hopefulness in the moments before a first kiss. Feel the purring visuals, see the world glow. This electric moment can be played as a seamless loop to last forever.\n\n***\n\nThis NFT drop is the premiere of the 4K resolution version of \u201cDuet\u201d, the GIPHY original was 1080p.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbWNxcyH793LChaHGqWqtMvjZDkcnreXCJ8NzjgwruqPs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfQoyRMn1wbknS6NmGfMaMCkDvRDct95KmM5nkmA2DTo6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbWNxcyH793LChaHGqWqtMvjZDkcnreXCJ8NzjgwruqPs", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SKQmQahsqV8YcktR75eobfFBxqthR6ySo"], "tags": ["cats", "kissing", "kiss", "electriccatnip", "catnip", "psychedelic", "animation", "love", "trippy", "soulmates", "amore", "amor"], "extra": {}}
