If you see a nest near your front door, it is probably just a paper wasp! Paper wasps have small, open nests that will fit in your hand. Yellowjackets have large, enclosed hives that are usually underground.\n\nCanon EOS 2000D\n1/250 second\nF/7.1\n100mm\n200 ISO", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNeixyCLvnJf2CnwkwgGv8aF8jknnAK6LYioQqnSTL3Lf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW2Bq8B85AuLTLfEiQUKbKCsnHVnERnqkNQtiF6ic6d5D", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNeixyCLvnJf2CnwkwgGv8aF8jknnAK6LYioQqnSTL3Lf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Y3fucmxvZrwEoaaNE6NkZTXufH5Hc26ir"], "tags": ["macro", "photography", "wasp", "pollinator", "paperwasp", "100mmMacro"], "extra": {}}
