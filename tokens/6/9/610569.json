At first we hesitated and being afraid to make a decision, now it\u2019s going to be much more easier for us to take the decisions.\n\nSo never burry your dreams because dreams can never die, no matter how deep you bury your dream, it will only faint and it will come back again when we are old in a form of regrets.\n\nThe egg that represent a new life and the white gerbera daisy has symbolized the innocent hearts of children, and happiness and gratefulness for the life you have been given.\n\n\u201cCarpe Diem.
