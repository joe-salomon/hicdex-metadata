It is based on a detail from Van Gogh\u2019s Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear and Pipe,\u00a01889. This series explore how well a set of random geometric coloured areas can represent an image. It also explores how well the same random geometric pattern can represent different images. Five artworks in this series are based on well-known paintings from masters. A random geometric pattern that was kept identical throughout the series was overlaid on the selected image and each area is filled with a randomly selected colour from the same area of the original image.
