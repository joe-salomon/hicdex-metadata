I oversampled all 4 tracks that composed this work, rendering the WAV at 96kHz and thus generating more information between the spaces of each sampler rate when played in a 48kHz session.\n\nFor each individual instrument I have produced a generative figure that reactivates the instrument's base frequencies, respectively drums, bass, guitar and organ in geometric shapes intertwined with the sampler rate of the WAV file.\n\nIn the generative patterns I used as input a low pass filter on the bass and drums audio; a mid side filter to work the organ and guitar stereo in the generative pattern. Parameters modified through generative art are glitch patterns like datamosh and keta effect, as well as the complexity of the projected 3D object in its number of vertices and edges.\n\nMP4 - 700p x 700p 30FPS 32 bit depth colour\n48kHZ 24bits\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZGz9JCeX1E1UbztpuybyJiM7G9TX1umfywy5iPv6q8h7", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd7e1CXv7eiStbBsGP17H8w3KdyCtXsD3JDgTCrUKvBhm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZGz9JCeX1E1UbztpuybyJiM7G9TX1umfywy5iPv6q8h7", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Tp8PHdx2KsvHyVWb4NaGev8wXLk1HwqCw"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
