Eyes open and closed.\n\nHer hair tinged with platinum flecks. The Sun bounces kindly from her hair which appear as millions of long flowing antennae.\n\nThe Earth Loves her presence and the Tribe does too. Her compassion is endless. Wisdom great and Divinity strong.\n\nIf She calls. You hear.\nWhen She speaks. You listen.\n\nGod has his hands on Nana and she opens her arms to You.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV8LPif43a97zGJjdW9ppbZorfA6j1VGFLrMmguCqwXLd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbCDkgN6qXRMr4whyoex6ULadHMN52msKECw1PV1EiMm5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV8LPif43a97zGJjdW9ppbZorfA6j1VGFLrMmguCqwXLd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UXPeDzfhtXfSFT796Zby3VKWfmTC5pavU"], "tags": ["AI", "vqgan", "words", "art", "prose", "vqgan+clip"], "extra": {}}
