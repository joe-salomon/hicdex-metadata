The materials are from an article in National Geographic magazine about poison.\n\nI made several copies of this zine, which I sold to friends. But just a few, because the cost of production is expensive.\n\nThis zine was created before I decided to focus on collage making, I was still mostly painting at my art practice during that time. But I like to combine images already.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPHLjeaqjJKqaCALy4HvzohUp521M7rzYHfJFjiTmHY5a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcD869K1YRZckL96FvnY2Q82Qi9pBBoUi5uxLYiczN8L5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPHLjeaqjJKqaCALy4HvzohUp521M7rzYHfJFjiTmHY5a", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1av3PU2PNW6WxHVZuVSAwjbySs7McRLEFB"], "tags": ["jurnalkolasefrnss", "collage", "analogcollage", "poison", "zine"], "extra": {}}
