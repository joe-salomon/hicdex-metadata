The individual is at the highest point of his existence. Having already tamed her fears and longings. Having already overcome life. Here, near his last breath, is when he is ready to share his legacy. The author symbolizes this stage with Saint George giving the final thrust to a dragon with his spear. The dragon represents life, fears and goals achieved. The knight is beyond human life, dominating the earthly drives and surrendered to a higher spiritual world.\n\n2000x2047px\n\nFull story here: nft.matiasmarano.com/renaissance", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmevWqNXXL2fMpnYjj5m3tRbwGbBUGkNGeHSrirSGJXnme", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWB4nNsHQp3CgDqne4gvAxERvFhkNAzSxXSTBNzvvD2Gn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmevWqNXXL2fMpnYjj5m3tRbwGbBUGkNGeHSrirSGJXnme", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2NzvDGTtWUd195Yi5YewHXSY6mEwbmWjF4"], "tags": ["illustration", "renaissance", "2d", "contemporaryart", "fineart", "digitalillustration", "painting", "saintgeorge", "stgeorge", "nfts", "collection", "paint", "dragon", "knight", "skull", "battle", "fight", "death", "spear", "horse", "nft"], "extra": {}}
