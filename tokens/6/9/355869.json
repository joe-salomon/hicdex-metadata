It was May I believe and over 100F for the 3 mile round trip hike to get there. It had to be done though. The landscape along with Sylva's amazing headdress wouldn't take no for an answer. Sylva has her own HEN account selling her own photography and self portraits so check her work out as well. User: bubblesandfrown\n\nI'm not very good at selling myself or doing work for other people so I've always struggled a bit financially. It's worth it to get to shoot what I want when I want. I'm hoping to finally find a home for my work where people appreciate it so please take a look at the rest of my creations and feel free to contact me at the links in my bio if you have any questions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmctQE3uisKrQDffyEfEZjbs2GqrGHWUPqk3PrtRTL5syy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXh1q1r8k849MXyoTBF286Jn4bJFQEEfqRKscrpxD8XYM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmctQE3uisKrQDffyEfEZjbs2GqrGHWUPqk3PrtRTL5syy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["photo", "keithallenphillips", "model", "photography", "nft", "woman", "moon", "moonscape", "headdress", "extravagant", "Mojave", "Amboy", "GlamHiking", "hatmaker", "BubblesAndFrown"], "extra": {}}
