It holds a very significant value to myself and I believe others would like it as well. Therefore that\u2019s why I\u2019m putting it up for sell. I would love to see others rocking it as their profile picture or to have it apart of their nft collection. It would make my day. Thanks for taking the time out to read this and I hope you enjoy my other art pieces that I\u2019ve created directly from my iPhone due to my PC being messed up. Have a great day! \nThanks for supporting me & my artwork,\niCryptologist\n-Find me on Twitter @iCryptologist if you purchased this piece along with a screenshot and I will follow you back.
