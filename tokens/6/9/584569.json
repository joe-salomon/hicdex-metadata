I originally created this as artwork for a book about cosplay and cosplayers called \u2018Heroes and Villains: The Fantastic Brought to Life.\u2019 My partner and I are still going to bring it to life, so if you find yourself with a print of this on the wall, I\u2019ll be sure to update you when the full book is available. It\u2019s going to be a great project!
