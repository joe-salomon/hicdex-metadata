Catoctors are creatures that live in the Blue Mountains of Nar, near Machkal. They are a derivative of cats that were exposed to high Magical Energy of the Infinite Volcano which elevated their IQs to more than 9000. To be healed, Dino and Jaru were transported to Dawa, the 13th Magical Location. This floating health center regroups the best surgeons in the Southern region of Nar. The center is well known for two healing facilities. The first one is the Khalta machine.
