{"__version": 1, "token_id": 495969, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LOL", "description": "LOL, which is an initialism for \"laugh out loud\" or \"laughing out loud\". It's been around on the internet since the early to mid-1980s and has become part of our daily lexicon. Think about how ubiquitous this simple saying has become to our culture. If you're under the age of 50, you most likely know what LOL means and use it on some form of a daily basis.  I wanted to take LOL and bring it back to it's computer roots. I mirrored the word to the right and then flipped it up upside-down. The result resembles either some ancient coding symbol like [808]. Do you remember the first time you saw LOL and didn't know what it meant? Think back to the first time you used a computer or some form of new technology. Hold onto that sense of wonderment because the next 20 years of computing is going to be a quantum leap forward...literally.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRa72WabiveHSeWzu4e1Ujq5i5bErRFCRDogqVp39YJWM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXZy1xmUtpsuDjpWfA2QmQkt7TGVkpMofgV2hF39NMBW6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRa72WabiveHSeWzu4e1Ujq5i5bErRFCRDogqVp39YJWM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
