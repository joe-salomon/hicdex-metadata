To stylize and emphasize the sharing of these letters I used only 1 \"L\" and elongated and exaggerated it's features. Another thing about these words that makes them unique and worth showcasing is that their meanings are near opposites. MILD (is gentle or kind in disposition, manners, or behavior. Also moderate in type, degree, effect, or force.) WILD (Occurring, growing, or living in a natural state; not domesticated, cultivated, or tamed.) They aren't quite opposites in the traditional sense, but I'll allow the stretch of definitions to fit my purposes here. (as if it were up to me. lol)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXjM97X9wzBtLQFRaniMh38t7TTcf5yB9WYTZQTx3R3P4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbMVZFsfCCebDc24HgmrJF7s4zn4XsvPHZTE6Lid5UK72", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXjM97X9wzBtLQFRaniMh38t7TTcf5yB9WYTZQTx3R3P4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
