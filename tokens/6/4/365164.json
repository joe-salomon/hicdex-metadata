Outside, the Niidim-12 crystal serves as an indestructible, transparent, anti-radiation container for the other. The inner crystal's composition is 100% pure Ehxgerath-33, a radioactive element key to unlocking inter-dimensional travel. \n\nThe POWERGEM is safe for humans to hold \n\nThanks to the specific conditions Mount Olympus' volcano created and the ultra-rare elements found at Saaktinor Mogh, the POWERGEMZ could form in a way that humans could harmlessly hold. The inner part's radioactive decay is contained in time and space by the external crystalline formation.\n\nCollected and brought to Earth by the Ancient Martian Elders, the POWERGEMZ are now in the hands of a few extraordinary humans.\n\n_\nThe buyer of this POWERGEM will get a free Unique Edition of POWERGEM_01 - Inter-Dimensional Crystal - Display Version.\n\n_\nGIF / 50 fps / 1080x1080 px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfNz4rhMbiZNHHm8Tv1bzTbUWQoWoTZTG4BkiYednNRGf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfNz4rhMbiZNHHm8Tv1bzTbUWQoWoTZTG4BkiYednNRGf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfNz4rhMbiZNHHm8Tv1bzTbUWQoWoTZTG4BkiYednNRGf", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cALi4cQRKtSMCU92nkmtQtZPZGppeHke1"], "tags": ["powergemz", "powergem", "powerverse", "digital", "crystal", "3d", "perfectloop", "loop", "unique", ""], "extra": {}}
