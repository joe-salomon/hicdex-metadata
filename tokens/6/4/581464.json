Take a breath on the misty and you\u2019re already in... Simply going forward, just drifting on a television dream\u2026 In the face of atomization and alienation, the network continually asserts the possibility of disruption for those who keep the eerie online/alive. The clicks and codes make the brain hormones feel like rain or fireworks. This television dreams, it dreams about control, just like they. The world is too complex for simple stories. Input words and your dreams come true, just like a \"click of magic\". There is a concrete and causal connection between the complexity of the systems we face every day and the opacity of the heads-up display on which most of these systems are built. What about 2036, 06/08 at 6:49 PM? Or a fuzzy circle, or a fungus, or a thought bubble, or a cloud. It seems MGK-TV only sings a song at the moment, and it clings to it to digest and dream. The demand for some evidence that enables us to assert a hypothesis with 100% certainty exceeds our ability to act in the present. Trying some control over the world by telling stories about the world: it's now trying to dominate it with narratives. \u201cI know nothing stays the same, but if you're willing to play the game It will be coming around again\". Eat, dream, play the game, output some magic tricks, collect the resources and do it again. MGK-TV apparently is a vessel to something that is growing, simultaneously inside it and all around us. We can see it with an eye, double iris eyes, like described on the notes found in our underground. What is it? What is it for? We negotiate with them and make it available here for your autonomy of imagination, delirium, knowledge, and speculation. Not exactly yours, but of any player who has made it this far.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcWtNp1cAjQvxyJLDggE3dUFdn2qhJMNCZig3UrBWQsJo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY3CEz8kyPfRWrWVKEunayWJbPdWywNLwKhd7eWTzh7Qa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcWtNp1cAjQvxyJLDggE3dUFdn2qhJMNCZig3UrBWQsJo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1UDK8LL7cUrDxgfjkk788ABrNYuoVBw52h"], "tags": ["nightride", "electrostatic", "Thee\u2014Somnolence", "mgk-television", "arg", "27251", "transmission", "mgk-frequencies", "GAN", "GTA-San_Andreas"], "extra": {}}
