Whilst they devastate flora and fauna many plant species in Australia have adopted fire into their life cycle, the heat and smoke triggering  germination and clearing out canopy shade to allow sunlight to reach the smaller plants beneath. The lingering smoke from the fires also produce brilliant orange and pink sunrises and sunsets.\n\nOriginal photography filtered through the lens of generative abstraction. Digital oil painted onto a noisy geometric canvas. 6000x6000.
