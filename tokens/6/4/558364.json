The ocean is an unpredictable and mysterious subject, but it has an undeniable allure. For every crashing wave and tumultuous tide, there\u2019s an ensuing pause for clarity and reflection. It\u2019s during this instance where beauty shines brightest. Just as chaos tampers with focus, calmness aids in creativity. There\u2019s a hypnotizing peacefulness that dances along the warm ocean breeze. Our bodies are made up of 70% water, perhaps that\u2019s what draws us in. During sunset, all the dots are connected and the mind is at ease. The clouds lit up like brushstrokes, colors were radiant, and the golden light was mirrored across the still tide pools. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the show.
