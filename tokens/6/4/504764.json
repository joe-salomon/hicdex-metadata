I took a number of burst shots to catch a pedestrian (there weren't many) in just the right place in relation to the condensation and streaks on the glass. Patience paid off. I later added an abstract city skyline, then added a texture to create an otherworldly feel. All of this gave my pedestrian subject the appearance of an extraterrestrial biped exploring our very cold planet.\n\nAbout the View Portal\nThe \u201cview portal\u201d that frames the image is a photograph of an industrial window in a renovated cookie factory. The window provides a gateway into fanciful realms where you can explore worlds familiar and unknown. \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQ9LPDbtwJQDNDZjQVLaSfgx6z6SutywfhzanCQbiAyq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmecrtWHrzrvwS626Ugyp1kJrDFu4BNKdjuQMrC7ZLiDxS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQ9LPDbtwJQDNDZjQVLaSfgx6z6SutywfhzanCQbiAyq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LyqA6KX1sLH2ZcCLTzEnSWiijY4NCiySQ"], "tags": ["snowstorm", "cityscape", "composite", "surreal", "portal"], "extra": {}}
