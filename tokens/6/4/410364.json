It has the appearance of a tiny, living human doll, up to 12 cm in length. Others have said they are living mummies measuring in between 15 and 20 cm. They have long hair which grows sparse and stiff through the legs, and long nails. It is sometimes said that they were formerly human beings. They have also been called vampires. Jenglots began to appear in the community in 1997.
