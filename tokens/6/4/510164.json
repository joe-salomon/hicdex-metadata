If you have seen and bought this card, it means that you need to be ready to take action and gain new experiences.\nWhen this card is revealed, it announces that it is time for an important decision. This can be difficult or risky. You will still be asked to make the decision. In this spirit, you must accept change and the unknown. Resisting will only bring you disappointment and sadness. However, if you let yourself go with the flow of life without resisting, a great chance will come your way.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUvUtk6VTR4Ueno9zsbvgQkApqz8AJmwjjwnWnLNamVx3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUvUtk6VTR4Ueno9zsbvgQkApqz8AJmwjjwnWnLNamVx3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUvUtk6VTR4Ueno9zsbvgQkApqz8AJmwjjwnWnLNamVx3", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1bcaZTEBjHA3Uy6TmsD2R5jhBeyoGNkCgR"], "tags": ["tarot", "deck", "cards", "mystic", "fortune", "japanese", "ukiyo-e", "japan", ""], "extra": {}}
