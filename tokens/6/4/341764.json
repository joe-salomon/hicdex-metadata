It's the ultimate point for watching, a little higher on the ground where we can see all parts of our village, and also the next village far away.\nThe village ends here, we stop to visit our shelter.\nThis is the entrance door. If you stand in the middle of the shelter, facing this door, you will see a long horizontal mountain looking like a big skirt.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbb4i91DhS9qNNkziYV6vyQND38eW4LBDTuQZb7B2nDKY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPz3qA6PPaMfYPaB63sDkQrw7DK1MyotMiWvWW8DZuBPq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbb4i91DhS9qNNkziYV6vyQND38eW4LBDTuQZb7B2nDKY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["Analog", "People", "Photo", "Human", "Filmphotography", "Photography", "35mm", ""], "extra": {}}
