I'm sure (and hope) many of us have played with something similar. I never thought back then to place the cardboard again sticking it in a different point to the motor axis. If we had done this as kids, we might have gotten something like this drawing.\n\nHere's to experimenting and letting your senses & history & self tell you what it means to you. I hope it means something to someone else too.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro.\n\nMade with Processing, 3500x2000 png.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYjJbcN38TwsbhSZYBDqbppxfXXVV84HLHzPJiHkqzwgk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUTJy8nro54VykjdF3GavAjsfJ481gZ65g9MGKvdtogej", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYjJbcN38TwsbhSZYBDqbppxfXXVV84HLHzPJiHkqzwgk", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eCX4smQ3LbxwDR3pqNoLQvNNKiHJtpwYz"], "tags": ["geometric", "children", "polycircles", "circles", "genart", "procedural", "generativeart", "generative", "iillucid", "minimalist", "lines"], "extra": {}}
