The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: My friend is a labourer. He is deft \nwith a saw, though somewhat clumsy with an axe. \nWe are walking along a well-used trail. Discreetly, I cut a groove in the forest floor, creating a nice hollow for shelter. My axe falls to the ground. I have to get to my other tool before it falls apart. As we walk forward, a half dozen boys see me and begin jeering. I have to be stealthy. As we walk forward, a man jogs past and jeers at us. I can tell he is not pleased, the jeering growing louder and louder. Slowly we begin walking away from him. I pass out from the jeering.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 112 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSd9QkXYTkPoGMixbY7b9issRLDqdXLU53HggUhuEqdUx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaDkDjkjFE9CVPjU2CLYdHBApdw1ucnqwMLy5BZpGxZZH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSd9QkXYTkPoGMixbY7b9issRLDqdXLU53HggUhuEqdUx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
