Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be raised to live forever. Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised in strength.\"\n\n\n2160px x 2700px | 300dpi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbrL29XNRMcr1T1Be5Kvf8WgZXpzgoH5A9AKDKPgkKUzT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPPud8bo69Qeubs7A71bimoKo667jHo2xbdgc9prFCF8h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbrL29XNRMcr1T1Be5Kvf8WgZXpzgoH5A9AKDKPgkKUzT", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LYTtevoCfmmbWn8vGagPJuoNGLawFNeUm"], "tags": ["digitalimaging", "indonesianartist", "eternal", "religion", "statue", "ihzmqf", "artwork", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "surrealism", "collages", "collage"], "extra": {}}
