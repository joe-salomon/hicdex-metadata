Dash doesn\u2019t believe that the child is his and actually I\u2019m not sure myself but finally he relented. \nHe takes care of the child while I go out to work some nights, I don\u2019t make enough for my own drugs and now I need to support this child too. Food is expensive.. I should start him on cigarettes soon so he eats less.\"\n\nShe loves Noideer (her son), not much but more than Dash. Fortunately, he was a quiet boy and quite obedient so she rarely beats him, not like her own father. The only exception is when he gets involved in arguments with Dash, he can never see how bad he is and always defends him.
