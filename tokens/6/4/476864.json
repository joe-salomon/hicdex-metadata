She first introduced collage into her work around 1988, but took it to a higher level in 1997 during a period of illness. When she had recovered, later that year she began to produce collage paintings \u2013 images of people encountered over time in the street and in mind journeys that manifest themselves and recombine, according to her mood, in the process of creation. Collage helps to effect an almost alchemical transformation in the works, through its function as sign, to its active involvement in the dialogue between paint, drawing and resin. Anne\u2019s works rarely include text, yet they are narrative-driven, reaching a kind of apogee in her magnificent handmade books, in which image and physicality combine as analogues of living experience. Though well-known in the USA, this will be Grgich\u2019s first solo exhibition in Australia.\n\nProfessor Colin Rhodes\nCallan Park Gallery\nSydney College of the Arts\nThe Visual Arts Faculty of the\nUniversity of Sydney\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CRLoka5lWaf/?utm_medium=copy_link\n\nhttps://annegrgich.com/grgichcdgcollaboration\n\nhttps://www.outsiderart.co.uk/artists/anne-grgich\n\nhttps://www.petulloartcollection.org/anne-grgich/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaz3aFVLgFb5v8WUJAifaKegnL8fy4B1RZBzvoUTYXbuy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTVcMbFpkgvigeEMV4BNbJTcLmY1kYBhoCLyVDGLq6r8t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaz3aFVLgFb5v8WUJAifaKegnL8fy4B1RZBzvoUTYXbuy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2WWBPDBAjfagGSTCnVL8ZPRXnU7LGgjPoT"], "tags": ["#love#hen#nftcommunity#cryptoart#tezos#nftartist#hicetnunc#nftcollectors#nftart#hicetnunc2000@onhicetnunc#nftdrop#crypto#cryptoartist#objkt#tez#1hen1#henp2p#nftcollector#outsiderart#annegrgich#annemariegrgich#rawvisionmagazine#museum@annegrgich"], "extra": {}}
