I was walking around my house, near a pond, when a beautiful white heron was looking for food. I've never seen one so close before. I searched on my phone for the meaning and this is what is said:\n\n\"According to mystics, the heron shows up to remind you to ground yourself daily in order for you to align with your higher self and get a bird's eye view of your current situation. To be comfortable in uncertainty because you're multi talented so trust in your abilities bc just like the heron, you are supreme patient hunter, striking at the right moment!\n\nTo take pride in all of your achievements and to give you the gift of wisdom and good judgment. The heron symbolizes stillness and tranquility so you can recognize opportunities. The trick is to just sit still until the time is right, you'll know when you know \ud83d\ude0c\"\n\nEven tho my mind was turbulent, this beautiful bird's presence calmed me. And I had to capture it's essence thru digital painting \n\n-Neo\n\nFollow and say hi @yoxneo\n\nPNG 4499 x 5626px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmddPgnjvJ3if2PEF9SJazxaGRes869CL4aAquCySQMmQb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRe29oc4eq27Hyi4o64e7VcWPp5U63834v3VggWs7JVWJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmddPgnjvJ3if2PEF9SJazxaGRes869CL4aAquCySQMmQb", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1a9tgW6NTCVGSCabnN4N3h2ocDrnkcmJDs"], "tags": ["heron", "white", "bird", "calm", "peaceful", "peace", "meaning", "beautiful", "ave", "painting", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
