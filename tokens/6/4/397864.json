One of which is now available as a 1/1 currently. Buy that and I'll include this for free. This photo was shot in our studio in Los Angeles as part of our Year Without Clothes series. The amazing mohawk headpiece was designed by Sylva herself. She goes by @bubblesandfrown on twitter as well as here on HEN where she shows her own photography.
