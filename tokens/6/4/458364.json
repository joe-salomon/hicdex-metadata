{"__version": 1, "token_id": 458364, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "VOID", "description": "The gates of inner vision are open and one dissolves into the void. To float free, infinite eternal, beyond spacetime. From darkness a single point of light coalesced from incomprehensible vibrations remains present but somehow nowhere. Suspended in all sense and feeling the entity peers deeper into the supernovae to be guided by stars to glimpse an unknown codex embedded in the fabric of all that was known to be real in its kaleidoscopic cascading intensity of pattern and form. What does it all mean? They ask.\n\nThis OBJKT is a 1/1 1000x1301px Digital JPEG Artwork\n\nThe original purchaser of this NFT OBJKT should claim an exclusive original higher resolution canvas print of the artwork which the artist will ship to a provided address. This material art object will not be reproduced and will therefore maintain the value of an original physical artwork.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUva9M5YcfpWMU9s5HCkcT6g1FW9wWJhQBxa5YS3vR4Gx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVaaFa2UMrzwDk6SMLXz3ycCuYA3a57atBBKQjTnwAnjw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUva9M5YcfpWMU9s5HCkcT6g1FW9wWJhQBxa5YS3vR4Gx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eHyPPPecPT2xN7YU2kv9enMUUVNsNEMeR"], "tags": ["illustration", "collage", "digitalart", "psychedelic", "space", "mystical", "zentricul"], "extra": {}}
