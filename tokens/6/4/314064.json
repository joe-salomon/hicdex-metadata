Characterized by their giant, jawless baby head, these demons use their fleshy pseudopods to grab and hold prey until it can tear chunks of flesh off with its sharp teeth. \n\nFleshlings are Creepers due to their vulnerability to terrestrial attacks, as well as their known vulnerability of being incapacitated by dismemberment. Their overall movement speed is slow due to the large mass it has to pull along the ground. When encountering one, remember that while the mass stays the same, their pseudopods can change their length to capture prey who think they\u2019re safely out of reach. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYjYDBDgvu4F9p41gJFruA6hMMRWRuZY3WyMk7NCVV7Nh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRYBf2aRWMgroXcrtABVXBNB8hEGyW3M4cpkCxNdw2jXJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYjYDBDgvu4F9p41gJFruA6hMMRWRuZY3WyMk7NCVV7Nh", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["darkwheelnft", "darkwheel", "darkart", "horrorart", "horror", "monster", "demons", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
