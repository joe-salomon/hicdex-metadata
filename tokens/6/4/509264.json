It may be common, but not necessarily, tied to depression or inevitably negative speculations on purpose in life such as the futility of all effort (e.g., \"if one day I will be forgotten, what is the point of all of my work?\"). This issue of the meaning and purpose of human existence is a major focus of the philosophical tradition of existentialism.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme6ZBt3625fPS19VWM6qhL7ST2244C1JNeeE6WHzfrsrj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWAftz5RBDLjznYm3FgYaVxCaPuYef76BzoETtntQVrRQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme6ZBt3625fPS19VWM6qhL7ST2244C1JNeeE6WHzfrsrj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hE46VHQjtVhiBsYWhCRmHZ5BkdcLRJ3EM"], "tags": ["hen500k", "objkt4objkt", "hen", "nft", "gradient", "2d", "3d", "surreal", "conceptual", "color"], "extra": {}}
