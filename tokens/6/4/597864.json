One of the ways animals survive, locate food, find mates, etc. is through the sense of smell and the act of marking territory. So when we say the SCENT OF A SPECIES, IS MADE BY ITS FECES, we are tapping into this truth about many living creatures of the animal kingdom and the larger conversation of biology and chemistry. What is it about animals that they do this? Some could say it's behavior that's been genetically coded into each species through countless generations of trial and error; an adaptation that gives that specific animal an advantage to survive. Fascinating to think that animals use these concepts every moment of every second of every day to live.
