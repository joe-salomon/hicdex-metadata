I've recently noticed myself sometimes using alcohol as an unhealthy coping mechanism for loneliness. Through this visual exploration I seek to disrupt my comfort in producing work I feel confident in sharing; Work that is well polished but lacks personal meaning. I was partly inspired by the work of Veronica Nichols (damseldoe) and the vulnerability in her work.\n\nImage description: Horizontal image depicting 4 figures. The left is darker with a neon sign at the top saying \"LOVE ME\". Two figures stand under it, one with white hair is facing away from the camera and gripping the neck of the second one who's staring up at the first in handcuffs and lingerie. In the background a chandelier illuminates a dining room table two figure are sitting at it the first drinks from a bottle and the second stares deject at their phone.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVDRR1GLVo5rSVaxjqde3x9XWX3YcnzNpBenFsRunAXSG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSwmsSXfEpeiosNFzPh6sLE63yYG11qnW2XyCcikN1noT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVDRR1GLVo5rSVaxjqde3x9XWX3YcnzNpBenFsRunAXSG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZJUhPGkPvBNSApBM3bQNwsB5soax4CJE8"], "tags": ["photoshop", "mentalhealth", "personalwork", "artforcollege"], "extra": {}}
