When this OBJKT is burned, a unique 1/1 video 1500x1500 mp4 is generated using the wallet address and hash of the burn operation as a seed for the generation process. Once the new OBJKT has been generated, it is minted and transferred to the wallet who initiated the burn operation. The royalties on the generated OBJKT will be the same as this OBJKT. The video shown above is an example generated with a random seed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYVzFTez2mXnZusY5vH4pzkaWcNhB4PkfXH2G27ywjirq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfHdjQaR74KSY9MUTBgQZdDht8sHNpV7sSiGRmUJnQY7i", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYVzFTez2mXnZusY5vH4pzkaWcNhB4PkfXH2G27ywjirq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RkYY3jr1ocuPdQqrRefr5FqoawKQsmBmD"], "tags": ["GENERATIVE", "ABSTRACT", "COLOR", "VIDEO", "MINIMALIST"], "extra": {}}
