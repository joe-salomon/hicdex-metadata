Each individual GIF is made by subtly interweaving two photographic images. My art is inspired by the light that brought me back to life during a near death experience I had several years ago. I hope for my work to inspire a moment of internal peace, of rest for the busy mind.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nFormat: 21 second seamless video loop of 18 photographic-based GIF's, 3204 x 1624 pixels \n\n\nBIOGRAPHY:\nAnna Thorne is a visual artist from Florida currently living and working in New York City.
