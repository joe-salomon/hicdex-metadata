These maps grow slowly out of nothing but wandering through my mind, usually at night. Each of these maps takes place at golden hour, drawing highlights and long shadows emphasizing the unique terrain of these unexplored lands. My other pieces connect back to different parts of these maps, opening up a world of new and reoccurring characters.  (copyright)@davekiehl for personal use only.
