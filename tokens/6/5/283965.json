It's very open on the end result, so expect some variety ranging from animation, 3d, digital painting and others.\n\nAnd what a better way to kick off this series by taking part in the #objkt4objkt. Thank you in advance for collecting this work. I really appreciate it. Stay tuned for more works to come.\n\n3508x4961 / 300 DPI\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiagwufrcrxagdbum2sgk74ps2poha3v5wjh64xigam6pbmclyj7tm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicrzupu4kdpoyc2ydinuugj45ppevl5ttw2iyud4225qlw5mzhlyy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiagwufrcrxagdbum2sgk74ps2poha3v5wjh64xigam6pbmclyj7tm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hyqdxPxbYcMyFKVNfFjn7w2zegBKrmTHQ"], "tags": ["digitalpainting", "digital", "digitalart", "digitalillustration", "artwork", "art", "monochrome", "objkt4objkt", "painting", "illustration", "portrait", "design"], "extra": {}}
