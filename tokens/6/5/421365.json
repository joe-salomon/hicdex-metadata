{"__version": 1, "token_id": 421365, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Der Struwwelpeter", "description": "Der Struwwelpeter from the series Cry Baby | 2021 | acrylic and watercolour on canvas | 15.5 x 22 cm | original available for 105 Tezos\n\n\nThis painting is inspired in the drawing Baba Yaga by the Russian illustrator Ivan Bilibin. In the Slavic folklore, Baba Yaga is an ogress who steals, cooks, and eats her victims, usually children. \n\nThe image depicts me scaring my former partner away. He is seen very tiny in there, almost insignificant or at least I am wishing he was. The painting called Der Struwwelpeter, comes from the title of a famous German children's book by Heinrich Hoffmann. \n\nMy former partner was Austrian, and consequently I am very inspired by Germanic stories these days, specially in the realm of children's books as sadly, we had the emotional intelligence of a toddler back when we were dating.\n\nSo, the story of Der Struwwelpeter, describes a boy who does not groom himself properly and is consequently unpopular. He appears in this drawing barefoot, as he often liked to be. This drawing is an attempt to heal from this pain that I am dragging along for nearly a year now. \n\nIn the image, I am naked and vulnerable rooted on the ground. With him, I had for the first time, the true desire of finally settling down and the result of my certainty in what I felt for him was met with him running for his life.
