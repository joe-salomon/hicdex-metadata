A search that moves at lightning fast speeds, faster than we are physically able to get up or change our posture. Essentially we are problem solving & asking over hundreds questions in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe not really, but doesn't it ever feel that way? You're body is still and it's only been a couple seconds, but you might be time traveling, already imagining the end of your day..your life 5 years from now..you could be whatever age you are only worrying about the end of time. We mentally step out of our bodies or feel trapped in them rather, but worry on holding an identity..maybe different identities. So we scramble around, though whatever answers we may be looking for or the help we need, might be right in front of you. The sense of anxiety and not feeling like having the right faec on for the right situation at the right time....but sometimes just focussing on now and building more awareness to where the answers come from, usually within, with just a bit of attention.You can pay attention to the stick figure dancing in panic or you could be still and see the details unfold in front..might be a sight to see whilst grasping a bit more clarity. Idk and don't have the answer. I just now now is now and me worrying like usual just isn't it. This art is a simple reminder.\n\n\nFor more you can follow @no5ay._ on instagram where I will be presenting majority of this work. Also feel free to follow my twitter @no5ay_ where I will try to navigate in this new digital world and community with my social anxiety. I haven't been brave enough to really say much on there anymore, but I hope to find confidence in my life again through just the pure love of creating visuals & feeling them. If you collect anything from me, pls let me know! I'd love to tweet thank you for vibing with me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcirDvDtzG2vaXEFsdFo4tyxaCWE8VY775172jwjEoNtp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWHSMjySAPnnEDGRSQSYeq6jQ4qUKrCDygR2D5VLLesYv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcirDvDtzG2vaXEFsdFo4tyxaCWE8VY775172jwjEoNtp", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["abstract", "digital", "art", "paint", "expression", "trippy", "glitch", "visual", "no5ay_", "2021", "october"], "extra": {}}
