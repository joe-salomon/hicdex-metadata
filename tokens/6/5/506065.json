This is something that I experienced while I was journeying in the astral plane after taking a dose of magic mushrooms. \n\nWhen I created this piece, I felt what I feel when I am journeying, most of the time at a low dose. I felt this subtle communication with a being who I think manifested himself through my art to remind me not to take myself too seriously, which I was doing at that moment.\n\nThis was and is the message : \u2018Don\u2019t take yourself too seriously, don\u2019t take your life too seriously\u2019. He is laughing at us because this is what we do most of the time. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWKXqVL1mgbr1HunasSnmNGGaMwatPaxs1kppG4baSA66", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWKXqVL1mgbr1HunasSnmNGGaMwatPaxs1kppG4baSA66", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWKXqVL1mgbr1HunasSnmNGGaMwatPaxs1kppG4baSA66", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2KyE3nEiXB9BpfSvxxw9Z1aARFXVRbWwog"], "tags": ["psychedelic", "generative", "gan", "gif", ""], "extra": {}}
