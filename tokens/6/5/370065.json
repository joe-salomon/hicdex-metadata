He also fought against many apostates and enemies of Zartosht to do so. In return, Zartosht gave Esfandiyar a chain and armor from Heaven. The armor made him invincible and the chain had the power to bind anyone, even a demon or evil magician, making them unable to escape. Zartosht also gave a Divine blessing to the prince and declared that anyone who would spill the blood of Esfandiyar (killed him) shall suffer a cursed life of bad omens until the day he dies and even after death would be condemned to hell.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR9oyn7zJdUVuPeyvH1nf9SrwqqDxRwBB5KEDD8r25jMY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXUyAehigKt3XK3h7D2hssL25Zah2NhxQsTkGtCRjqcpB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR9oyn7zJdUVuPeyvH1nf9SrwqqDxRwBB5KEDD8r25jMY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["digital", "golden", "paint", "esfandyar", "shahnameh", "zartosht", "golden", "nice", "basil", "day", "price", "king", "crown", "evil", "cursed", "character", "minimal", "coloful", "yellow"], "extra": {}}
