Motus Monumentum.", "description": "1/3 from \u201cInner Monuments\u201d collection.\nIt\u2019s a collection that rises from the rubble to rediscover our inner power, our courage, self-love and self-confidence. Through the Capitoline Triad: Juno, Minerva and Jupiter. Each sculpture represents a forgotten power that we all have within. It\u2019s a message of self-improvement.\n\nDescription of the piece:\nIn Roman mythology, Juno is the queen of the gods, the goddess of marriage and motherhood.\nTherefore, in this collection Juno represents the emotional aspect of the human being. To restore this monument you must ask yourself: What do you really feel? It is important to find the answer, to recognize it, in order to guide your way there. Do not deny your emotions and on the contrary accept them, live them and go through them to free yourself. Go through the duels that are necessary to heal. \nLook for pure bonds and stay away from people who hurt you and do not treat you as you deserve. Do not allow others to deny your emotions either, you are your own judge. And as an even more important factor: love yourself. No matter what. Even if you are not where you want to be yet, even if you don not have money, even if you fail... love yourself unconditionally, just for existing, surrender to this. That is the first step.\n\nPower animal: Peacock.\n\n1446x2000px\n\nFull story here: nft.matiasmarano.com/innermonuments", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbbUb1ye4V79S87ngZ9xxw61szvtYvsJmz7aeoREoNnqX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdncFfcBcSxPEZT4Wrw23TAmG5rcUanVeoVkZw1mBeiYp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbbUb1ye4V79S87ngZ9xxw61szvtYvsJmz7aeoREoNnqX", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2NzvDGTtWUd195Yi5YewHXSY6mEwbmWjF4"], "tags": ["illustration", "2d", "contemporaryart", "fineart", "digitalillustration", "painting", "nfts", "collection", "paint", "nft", "statue", "Juno", "Hera", "goddess", "rubble", "ruins", "monuments", "temple", "urban", "graffiti", "love", "selflove", "depression", "skull", "vandalism."], "extra": {}}
