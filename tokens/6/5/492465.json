The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nin my dream: A woman is sitting in an airplane with \ntwo children. As the children\u2019s father reads a book, the children\u2019s mother comments, \u201cGrandpa is missing.\u201d The children are understandably worried. He reads a while, then says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am. I\u2019m reading concentratione by Amadeo Rodchenbach and HG Wells.\u201d The children are relieved and excited. The father is apologetic. He has neglected the children. He needs to read more about the war. The woman wants to know more.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 114 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR2TKhcDNcoVE4rXVamvmLGUFfxmRCj1Ap9GHYPvJK1p3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ6fpb4feqa2gPEG2cntzmc3hCUkPgXcnwSnVokHsoZ9L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR2TKhcDNcoVE4rXVamvmLGUFfxmRCj1Ap9GHYPvJK1p3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
