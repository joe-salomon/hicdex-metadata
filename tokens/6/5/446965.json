Made up of potassium gas atoms, it can reach temperatures as low as -273 degrees Celsius. \nInside this lake live the Buslouis, plants that are able to survive such low temperatures. Incredibly, they can live up to 300 years and last a whole year without feeding.\nWhen they swim, they give off certain vibrations from their organism that can be heard outside the lake like songs.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNb2dfEbTgnA27ijfQZLjxVhgoy4jzd3F5D2SQoXYZyiG", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcfv5eH6jLEabqB5KbDaR6aveKXXvzmDqmUpDkf7T8Vpk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNb2dfEbTgnA27ijfQZLjxVhgoy4jzd3F5D2SQoXYZyiG", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2XGyUK4nPCYmBpk4FpjvUxXXj3JDT3iX9Z"], "tags": ["3d", "plants", "nature", "scifi", "blue", ""], "extra": {}}
