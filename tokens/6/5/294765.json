All ceremonies and rituals in Santer\u00eda must first have the approval of Elegu\u00e1 before progressing. He is the messenger of Olofi. Within the \"Regla de Ocha\" [Cuba], he slightly differs from Echu, who in this case is seen as his brother, by having less dangerous and less aggressive characteristics. Elegu\u00e1 moves silently; in contrast, Echu \"breaks through\". Manifestations of Elegu\u00e1 includes Akefun, Aleshujade, Arabobo, Awanjonu, Lalaf\u00e1n, Obas\u00edn, Oparicocha, and Osokere.\n\nThis NFT is made with my personal Elegua .\n\nreference:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegua#:~:text=Elegua", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifla7adc2qazhgbcdgsl6hkq6cukn7chwck6ixx2gqnk4xihbrwj4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifpgrazzbgv4zkydyhrqgbjxmgvng4fyocpztcivxbp644bafz6ha", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafkreifla7adc2qazhgbcdgsl6hkq6cukn7chwck6ixx2gqnk4xihbrwj4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PTbafFgKp7irKbGsxwVtkUiYWNNF2ajmj"], "tags": ["santeria", "orishas", "yoruba", "elegua", "spells", "magick", "witchcraft", "voodoo", "eshu", ""], "extra": {}}
