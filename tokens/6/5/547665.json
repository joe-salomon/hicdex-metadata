In my mind, everyone thinks differently about me. So I hid myself from everyone. Alone with my own thoughts, in a bubble - a hardened shell\u2026 \n\nI thought the shell was protecting me, but it became a wall around me, isolated from everyone. For so long I sat in my bubble, alone from the outside world until one day I decided it was time to break free. Breaking free of everyone\u2019s thoughts. Going against all odds to fly together like a butterfly because it doesn't really matter anymore.\n\nAt the end of the day, we will all leave this place and head to the same destination, leaving everything behind. Alone will not get me anywhere. So I broke free as it was better to go somewhere than nowhere.\n\n2160\u200a\u00d7\u200a2880 [PNG]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme239ZX3iAGXg315oXVvgPnBwmuA2V9xHgFjnGhVF3P4F", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdgP6eVBved6ofcK7aKgiWVVAC4hX13uFpjC1zJYzpyLn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmXm7SDRTRxszQYJj5jGN8iubGxxNoakgk8rMXhSNc8hLs", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme239ZX3iAGXg315oXVvgPnBwmuA2V9xHgFjnGhVF3P4F", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SCVEqinpMpmLZEXm8y2DUB4Pwf2ewQvuJ"], "tags": ["zagestudio", "brunei", "butterfly", "3dart", "conceptart", "3d", "b3d", "cgart", "bubble", "portrait", "surreal", "freedom"], "extra": {}}
