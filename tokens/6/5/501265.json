In this case, try to follow the baroque technique of grisaille in raw umber and black and white for the flesh so that in the thinnest parts of the upper layers of color you can see the gray color of the base layer, something so characteristic of Rubens painting. It is made entirely in digital technique and its measurements are: 4179 x 4961 pixels at 300 dpi.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmedvyG6iJfLtGZB5TMEZLvH7j4STXmmvU6k9JZk6NB9m7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV9HbkZ39G44cWmZEKMwufngPqGuuSqd7cfygiMqw5o6A", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmedvyG6iJfLtGZB5TMEZLvH7j4STXmmvU6k9JZk6NB9m7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eJRJekAENFM9ZWNS9D3Eyg2cS8DAPqg7n"], "tags": ["portrait", "caricature", "baroque", "retrato", "caricatura", "rubens", "barroco", "grisalla", "pop", ""], "extra": {}}
