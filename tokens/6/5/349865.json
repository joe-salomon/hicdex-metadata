Noise is taken from circular motion on a 2D noise field with its own radius and offset. These values are mapped onto a range of colours according to one of seven different algorithms, and rotation is added to produce interference patterns with a choice from eight rendering modes.\nThe initial seed for this loop of 120 frames is 859793, which selects function 0 with offset (-86.0, -2.0), range (6.0, -0.800004), and function 3 with offset (-12.0, -61.0), range (0.6, -6.3999987). Noise is produced from sampling points on an ellipse at co-ordinates (77.0, 16.0) with diameters (1.6000009, 0.9000007). The three formulae are combined using algorithm 5 with hue values starting at 67 with range 225. The grid is 75 units square.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRJzNQ7VuriQw3bwunmt94ty4sqe9UERMBRDEmCKs5YvL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRJzNQ7VuriQw3bwunmt94ty4sqe9UERMBRDEmCKs5YvL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRJzNQ7VuriQw3bwunmt94ty4sqe9UERMBRDEmCKs5YvL", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VjCS2jiBTVPSEoYzJ79KkbYV5QbFJxuf3"], "tags": ["xisal", "noise", "loop", "processing", "grid", "859793"], "extra": {}}
