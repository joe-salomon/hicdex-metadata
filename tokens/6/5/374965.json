Some local village folk say they have holes in their perfect little leafs so they don\u2019t compete with God, the all mighty perfect one \u2014 so they say here in these mountain parts where there is very little people and a lot of belief. I don\u2019t know the official name of the flower nor do I want to. They are simply things that grow in the forrest and make me feel happy when I walk by them here in this place and time and offer to share them with you here and now. 3655\u200a\u00d7\u200a3655 pixels 300 dpi Digital Photography by Zoran.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRzAYuzDYjN2EE6juG1FS6iGvMvMGYJ5yxuA2mtTiY3XV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ2bDUEW12YhxjHVBByTRAgKWtpyCJW2P4pbLNFoDtCHS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRzAYuzDYjN2EE6juG1FS6iGvMvMGYJ5yxuA2mtTiY3XV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i2WCTZ3TfyL2fLULko3hMQMTiFqCLuS85"], "tags": ["flowers", "yellow", "nature", "growth", "hen4hen", "photography", "digital", "hen1000"], "extra": {}}
