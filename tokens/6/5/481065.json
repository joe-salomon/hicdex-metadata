The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: I\u2019m in a small windowless office with three young men. In unison, we\u2019re chanting a protest song. I hear one of the students talking about the VA, as if he\u2019s in the military. I raise an uninformed hand. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d I say. \u201cWho would do that?\u201d When the chant turns violent, I run from the room. The young men stand over me, unarmed, as I scream, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that\u2019s me, you son of a bitch? Don\u2019t you know that\u2019s me?\u201d When the student fails to recognize me, I strangle him with my bare hands.\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 80 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYP3A9ixhpUJ9p4YJUrzuWsVfxNsfqAtmW8pnECPLusJH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNVsQhTwhQKve8TnugWYKqiqZzKA9mkgatJYJ1QrqjYtF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYP3A9ixhpUJ9p4YJUrzuWsVfxNsfqAtmW8pnECPLusJH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
