This phenomenon is central to many encryption algorithms and one of the reasons that primes are important to nounGANs. This specific nounGAN, the 5th AI Imagined work and final nounGAN, was trained on all the prime Rinkeby Test Nouns as well as the first prime Mainnet Noun, Noun #2. The image\u2019s 41 frames superimposes the training data on a final robot painted canvas made with 13 colors and 21,011 brushstrokes. It is the final type of nounGAN, the Prime Noun of which only one exists.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV88CR6iNdsGj4ZgrsC9SwHNmHDfBZePYN1oeoaVvzB2k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV88CR6iNdsGj4ZgrsC9SwHNmHDfBZePYN1oeoaVvzB2k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV88CR6iNdsGj4ZgrsC9SwHNmHDfBZePYN1oeoaVvzB2k", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VCTBRF3RnLcbbxw5XeqQWUtuAZoyZt6Ut"], "tags": ["AIArt\uff0cartonomous\uff0cbitGANs\uff0cCreativeAI\uff0cGANs\uff0cnounGANs\uff0cNouns\uff0cPaintingRobot\uff0cRobotArt"], "extra": {}}
