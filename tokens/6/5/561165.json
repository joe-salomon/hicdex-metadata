The ambassador\u2019s  species is characterized by countless filaments that originate from the back of their head, generating three dimensional symbols and images as a form of speech. Fangorians use this type of visual communication only on two occations: For those who cannot grasp their high pitched sounds, and in their most intimate encounters. This very thought and the ambassador\u2019s tentacle-like filaments  made queen Latiffa teleport straight to Seik\u014d, the home planet of horrific ancient plant-like sentient beings. Most pleasure seekers, who visit Seik\u014d, do so only once and die from sexual asphyxiation. Not queen Latiffa, though. She comes prepared.\t", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaYX1zUNm96WJbFQcCtdEkcDGvMR6sHRC7aZEgLE98Lwn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaYX1zUNm96WJbFQcCtdEkcDGvMR6sHRC7aZEgLE98Lwn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaYX1zUNm96WJbFQcCtdEkcDGvMR6sHRC7aZEgLE98Lwn", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1dHC9es4qMoQKZjEP7A4zUwA3fUxrj5GCv"], "tags": ["hentai", "18+", "nude", "japanese", "drawings", "gif", "eink", "skin", "tentacles", "acient", "woman", "queen", "space", "sensual", "erotic"], "extra": {}}
