We ate pancakes and bacon, drinking a cup of coffee while chatting about life. The weather was cloudy and rainy, my preferred type of shooting conditions. We packed our gear and began our drive to Taughannock Falls. There was snow, sleet, and rain for the entire hour-long drive. Finally, as we entered the park and drove to the overlook, the massive 200 foot waterfall seemed to be magically \"Unveiled\" as the rain and wind stopped. The conditions were perfect and no one was there except for us. We had time to take in the views and appreciate how the perseverance paid off. The harshest circumstances create the most incredible moments.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTjK6rn8Gmtsx1q5TYiKbr7XNwfHZCMoBRm7yKv4TLtgF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWxYUtc2ui7vEoWgS29HV6vvbiMUDcHbKxPRex6rw7fdu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTjK6rn8Gmtsx1q5TYiKbr7XNwfHZCMoBRm7yKv4TLtgF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UmaagR4mp5XsvC8p1G9VVAGtpXaoeSj3V"], "tags": ["photography", "landscape", "waterfall", "fall", "autumn"], "extra": {}}
