For this reason she was named Keran\u00e1 (sleepy)./ \n\nTa\u00fa had fallen in love with the girl and, to conquer her, he transformed himself into a handsome young man. With his new appearance, Ta\u00fa visited Keran\u00e1 for seven consecutive days. On the last day, he tried to kidnap the girl, so Angatupyry (spirit of goodness) was forced to intervene to prevent it. To do so, he engaged in a fight with Ta\u00fa that lasted seven days. Finally, Ta\u00fa, using trickery, defeated Angatupyry. Ta\u00fa, seeing himself triumphant, took Keran\u00e1 with him. This caused deep sadness and indignation in the tribe, and they begged for an exemplary punishment for the transgressor. So Angatupyry took care of the matter again and subjected Ta\u00fa to a terrible curse. As punishment for Ta\u00fa's actions, Angatupyry condemned the couple to give birth to monsters. Thus, the seven monsters of Guarani mythology are born: Teju Jagua, Mb\u00f3i Tu'i, Mo\u00f1ai, Jasy Jater\u00e9, Kurup\u00ed, Ao Ao and finally Luis\u00f3n. All of them were born prematurely (at seven months).\n\n\ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude30 \ud835\ude19\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude36 (@\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude36_\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude30) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPiXkE4XG64FUo8pCr65fwspSq9AMqjSTtgJGupvFjMjJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbyUL2Z6nnBDFJsjF3x7RUZknA7tArvhVDPZXH82jePxx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPiXkE4XG64FUo8pCr65fwspSq9AMqjSTtgJGupvFjMjJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
