{"__version": 1, "token_id": 476665, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BIPARTISANAL", "description": "Ok, so I made up a word, sue me. There isn't a real word BIPARTISANAL, but there is bipartisan (adjective) and bipartisanship (adjective). I feel that this word could be a real word because it describes something that both parties are doing in a bipartisan way. Sort of an over descriptor, but valid none-the-less. I mean it'll never be accepted as a real word, but it's fun to come up with new words from time-to-time. In BIPARTISANAL, the work, we see that we can separate words within the main word almost exactly along syllabic sounds: BI-PART-IS-ANAL. Technically the ANAL, should read AN-AL, but that wouldn't make for good art now would it? For those that are sticklers for form/function/spelling/grammar/blah blah blah...sometimes you gotta break the rules. Just remember what Willy Wonka said, \"We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams.\" But I digress...So when we read out the words we see a pattern, the words read forward and then in reverse. Bipartisanship is hard work. It's difficult to get anything done when the other side just wants to be a stick in the mud towards real progress. You can read into the sexual innuendos if you'd like, I think it's pretty obvious and doesn't need too much guidance on that avenue.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme4RKd8SmEEtdC8xnipRWp96NPYFhC4iaxNKKpSPNg8ev", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeZ54Zpez6Gojc7rba3No4J2stoJGXUGJxkzUEbA675FP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme4RKd8SmEEtdC8xnipRWp96NPYFhC4iaxNKKpSPNg8ev", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
