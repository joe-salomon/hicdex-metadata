As the only butterfly known to make the transcontinental migration, Monarch Butterflies will be migrating from September to October in order to arrive at their \"wintering\" sites in November. Monarch Butterflies encounter various challenges on their two-way journey\u2026 strong winds can blow them off course... rain and/or cold temperatures can slow them down... the lack of energy-producing nectar sources, and parasitic diseases can lead to death as well as collisions with humans and their vehicles.\n\nThe image was created with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI).
