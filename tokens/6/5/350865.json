For a long time I could not complete the picture. Only the contest from @yankovskaya made it possible to put the final point, to complete the central element of the composition. The title of the picture speaks for itself. I share Belkovsky's concept of an impending new matriarchy, I lacked an inspiring impulse that would help me materialize my feelings. The creation of the elements of the composition was inspired by the great artist Deineka.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWK5n53v9DBAwrHtkpqL1CvgEhmH7q1AtwCBBUNeb4L1m", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVnCztW9T36YPRajeCsqW1QNQsrk6ZSe1buQtVuwXtSZu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWK5n53v9DBAwrHtkpqL1CvgEhmH7q1AtwCBBUNeb4L1m", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gZc62y2fzaFCtMdy4WJUuD1CEoSWYt5su"], "tags": ["Forward", "BEssonov", "matriarchy", "BullishArt", "BessonovFlejtskraft"], "extra": {}}
