{"__version": 1, "token_id": 560765, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Morondanga Republik: Night of the Frogs II", "description": "The Night of the Frogs(*) is a phenomenon that occurs on the fifth full moon of the year in a swampy region of the Morondanga Republik. When the Magnolia Frog enters the mating period, its skin emanates a strange gaseous substance that undergoes a chemical combustion under the influence of the moon. Many people come to the area in search of these vapors, which cause those who inhale them a phase of deep and philosophical psychedelia.\n\nMost people say they were never the same after the experience. Some see dead relatives who bring them messages from the afterlife. Others have cinematic experiences from a rock in the middle of the swamp.\n\nKing Philomenus (**) himself founded a religion out of this (***).\n\nMany people choose not to return. They say it is a once in a lifetime experience as it is intense, revealing and very profound.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021\n\n(*) See OBJKT #245972\n(**) See OBJKT #439879\n(***) See OBJKT #307756", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYsU3gtpLDnDawSYU4x4QtAcDvWcbNqNkdPmXsUGzAN1N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTFKYzmakhPtMiYsr95dfDWMJ9NjquGYtZQtP28zfrCm3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYsU3gtpLDnDawSYU4x4QtAcDvWcbNqNkdPmXsUGzAN1N", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Stamps", "Moon"], "extra": {}}
