{"__version": 1, "token_id": 165065, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hide n Seek", "description": "Nature vs nurture? Children are innocent until the world corrupts them. Corruption through abuse and neglect, both verbal and physical and through what they see and hear. Children are highly impressionable.\n\nSocio-economical factors, environment, emotional support, and love all play a role in what we become as adults. Children are not born abusers, racists, misogynists, or toxic humans. They are made, by us, the adults in their lives.\n\nThis artwork is about the negative affects all forms of neglect and abuse have on children. The children seeking love and support from the adults in their lives but trying to hide from abuse and neglect as it leaves physical and mental scars on their young psyches.\n\n5400 px X 7200 px by @dehiscenceart 2021.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUb7Dg6HAXYFvb2EpNwzGMvVpnSKWzCwJN6hY37WWxmoQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmebmh5UbPK6U6nhioibt5MW9bxnhjcUjxS7vMNJ7TumPo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUb7Dg6HAXYFvb2EpNwzGMvVpnSKWzCwJN6hY37WWxmoQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtZmtxhiWc8Nv6AtC1YjVCtJoFjv4nTqL"], "tags": ["SURREALISM", "DARKART", "COLLAGE", "ILLUSTRATION", "DEEPDREAM", "CLEANNFTS"], "extra": {}}
