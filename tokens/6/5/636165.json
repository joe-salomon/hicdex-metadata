Two workers died and also a third person, who was chilling at home, 2km away, was hit by debris and shrapnle caused by the explosion. This is a hommage to the people who lost their lives that day, and also a complaint versus all those corporations which unlawfully exploit their workers and use them as their own scapegoats. The company was fined with 180K\u20ac, and that was all. Everything remains the same so far. Neighbours still living with the same fear. Administrations still didn't move a finger to work on a serious safety plan. They even tried to blame the workers, claiming they were unexperienced. Fkn cowards.\ud83d\ude21\n\nThey sell us that they have everything under control, but not all that glitters is gold. Once you can see it from the inside, you quickly change your opinion. Workers safety always been a joke for these companys. We can see with our own EYES they are fooling us day by day, for a miserable wage.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc2k8rteDBXDjieQ6aL2BZAR8EHi2dnjWoQAwkiiRynNv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRciuFqcmrmLQKwAEFKuBCnRb29Mv6EQgYh7cPXKD6NGk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc2k8rteDBXDjieQ6aL2BZAR8EHi2dnjWoQAwkiiRynNv", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RbvV7aZgm5HvCMaur9ronuHKDCeG2i5Dx"], "tags": ["digital", "illustration", "vector", "vectorillustration", "cartoon", "lowbrow", "comic", "animation", "motiongraphics", "jordigandul"], "extra": {}}
