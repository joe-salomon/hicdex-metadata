They appear in my dreams, like pieces of reality that were or could have been. Sometimes they are nightmares, with dismembered bodies, other times, they are endless passages that yearn to be traveled, whispering from some remote point, to go forward, backward, somewhere, but not to stop moving.\nThe broken houses of my mind have escaped. They are out there now. On every corner, in every street of this ghost town. This is my new realm, my new reality. I walk among broken streets. Memories that left traces and scars.\nI never wanted to live like this, among broken dreams.\"\n\n\n7200x3012px\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcoMSM4we4TsuvDaLwJ8m3Y5iMgHciduDZNRT9jxGU3Aj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPTwdq8x6RZqDc7wGtkw6Gi4G44KvgkDL6nm2dGHhgFX5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcoMSM4we4TsuvDaLwJ8m3Y5iMgHciduDZNRT9jxGU3Aj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2AtqHCcK7w4dixtmCo3WLQLaASaepHhip5"], "tags": ["Walls", "decay", "broken", "henezuela", "photography", "dystopian"], "extra": {}}
