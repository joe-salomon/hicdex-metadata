The minerals are from developing and developed countries known for their mined resources and the local communities that mine them.\n\nForms are developed with Blender 2.93.6 Cycles experimental engine. Images of minerals are manipulated through procedural settings in Blender resulting in objects resembling flora, some more organic, others more crystalline.
