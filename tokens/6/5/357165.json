We had been chatting online for quite some time and it was a dream to have her wear my costumes and grace my camera lense.  Never have I seen such an exquisite dark seductress as her!  She is impossibly beautiful and a talented makeup artist and self portrait artist.  She's also a little evil, which I like in a woman!  I hope you enjoy staring into her eyes as much as I do! \n\nModel is Kim www.instagram.com/justcallmekim_makeup/\nHeaddress and photography by BubblesAndFrown.etsy.com\nWaist cincher and collar by Tommy Vowles https://www.instagram.com/tommyvowles/\n\nThis whole outfit is made with vegan materials, if that kinda stuff makes you happy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVSkMpj1r1Dwdmxr8SQ7jBKRfxjduQg1hDwjmAewHj9MC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ3dcxR37KaKTHerQxp4sHNS5AKArZiz8vuPCvmZ8NwaW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVSkMpj1r1Dwdmxr8SQ7jBKRfxjduQg1hDwjmAewHj9MC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ij4fDuptsj21qW1zqr3LDCERjbbC9rGcn"], "tags": ["justcallmekim", "fetish", "darkarts", "alternative", "bodyharness", "collar", "bondagecollar", "headdress", "headpiece", "costume", "vegan", "photography", "woman", "chains", "goth", "gothic", "alternative", "costumedesign", "veganfashion", "womanwithclaws", "berlin", "berlintheplacetobe", ""], "extra": {}}
