In this piece, Lovecraft's most famous character is rendered as an unholy merger of tropical flowers and cosmic horror.\n\nThis edition of 40 was given away via airdrop to top collectors of Mine, friends, people who have been kind to Me, and a few artists I admire.\n\nTwo artificial intelligence systems (VQGAN+CLIP) created this work.
