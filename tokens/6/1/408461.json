{"__version": 1, "token_id": 408461, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Black Pixel In the style of Malevich's \"Black Square\"", "description": "The smallest unit of digital art is the pixel. Here we have an image created with just one. It is a single black pixel, sized to match Kazimir Malevich\u2019s \"Black Square\" as closely as possible.\nWith most classic forms of 2D art the act of creation begins with a blank white field onto which dark marks are added and so in this new medium, it makes sense to follow this tradition. Here a black pixel is presented to the viewer. \nThis piece naturally aligns with the form of the classic work \"Black Square\" by Kazimir Malevich and so allows the appropriation of questions asked by that work and applies them to this. As such I endeavor to ask the viewer to codify the limits of art, craft, meaning and value. These questions are especially pertinent in the world today as we are faced with new technology for making, distributing and showing art.\nPeter Black 2021\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfY3D5xRmXkvd5etYdUk4oBa252GvcSrW6n3y2YAwQ4rn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSy3zzdMcZNsec8Wxfehf6W7kqrYAghCYFTKqjtLXjmrs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfY3D5xRmXkvd5etYdUk4oBa252GvcSrW6n3y2YAwQ4rn", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YoEwpZ783Zjzh2iXNrT6MxVyzvoJNAsF6"], "tags": ["black", "square", "pixel", "suprematism", "abstract", "Malevich", "minimalist"], "extra": {}}
