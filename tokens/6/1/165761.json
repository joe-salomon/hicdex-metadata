This piece is a commemorative Trash .Gif(which is really an .Mp4 but that's just what we call the aesthetic) made for cryptoart world community at large.  It's been a wild ride changing the art world thus far, and we've only just begun.  Cheers to the Electric Renaissance.....XOXO\n\nAlso, if you wish to view a small fraction of works that have been created around the world, feel free to check out Trsh.Capital (web address) and it'll beam you into a cryptovoxels gallery showcasing these said pieces.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbXLzpRZRytp3RBkLpfpKUqYmgsQ4R8VEgqdnCWh1PZiK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRzrbr62pNkXr2zekZrrG3PkiwJshZCmjeTkKyhrZssUU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbXLzpRZRytp3RBkLpfpKUqYmgsQ4R8VEgqdnCWh1PZiK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1a8dWf9tjUgVtTQcxjVUxdspp8EUfs5ZJJ"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
