(My first digital collage piece)", "description": "First post on ig: @burnedbyairfryer\nFirst piece created after just learning photoshop & my first digital art piece ever.\n\nAfter recent years of feeling lost, struggling with work and becoming numb to my previous passion of dance due to chronic pain & anxiety..I told myself on my 30th birthday that I will finally learn photoshop & finally commit to collage or digital artwork. That day came this year April 2021..This was the start of my journey into photoshop and after 100+ everydays..you can say my beginning into NFT land.\n\nDigital art is literally all I have right now. Been dealing with social withdrawal & just stuck inside my house before we were forced to stay in the house...It's been hard. Still is, but every time I finish a piece. Whether it's \"good\" or \"bad\", I can't help, but to feel a sense of accomplishment. A feeling I haven't gotten to feel in forever. A feeling I don't seem to remember. It slowly gives me confidence again & lets me know that my thoughts & efforts exist. At this point I'm kind of rambling about my depression & everything I have been dealing with for years...but if you collect this. Just know this is really the start of everything.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaq7GedyHD2oLMnoYXPc25UjAN676AhoZxF3gEmfJm9v7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPdZ9niehMkBcaY2cVEJoabjQQiFAjjkz8cuYEzrjwwrb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaq7GedyHD2oLMnoYXPc25UjAN676AhoZxF3gEmfJm9v7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["digital", "collage", "art", "surreal", "nft", "nftart"], "extra": {}}
