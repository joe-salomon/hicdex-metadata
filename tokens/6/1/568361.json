I do this as a way to disconnect myself and chill. It's my Genesis piece, the first NFT ever authored by me. From now on, I'll manage my curated artists from outside of this profile so this will serve my own and exclusive use. This volcano marks the beginning of a new cycle for this project while being a perfect symbolism for my NFT journey. I believe NFTs are a great way to show gratitude, create memories, or celebrate friendships and I'd like to use mines to do so. By owning my artworks you also become part of my NFT journey while supporting my activity promoting art and artists.\n\nI've sent a few editions of this .gif to people that have supported me or my curated artists and have been meaningful in my life here. Thank you!\n\n\nEvery pixel in each one of the 21 frames is hand-drawn by me. \n\n\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n\n.gif \u00b7 1,12Mb \u00b7 1024x1024 \u00b7 21 frames ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS6CVeE7SULsXAVJtCsBL2LEZ67QuXjLygJWpWoCxNzWM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS6CVeE7SULsXAVJtCsBL2LEZ67QuXjLygJWpWoCxNzWM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS6CVeE7SULsXAVJtCsBL2LEZ67QuXjLygJWpWoCxNzWM", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1gMRKQWdhY5ZPUehpHofLswyL8Vexvfpbm"], "tags": [".gif", "sutan", "pixel", "genesis", ""], "extra": {}}
