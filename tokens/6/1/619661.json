He gave me a better story for this picture.\n\nWhen you plan to stage some picture, let your friend ruin it!\n\n--\nBreaking is the original name of Breakdance, dancers are called b-boy and b-girl, it goes for Break-Boy and Break-Girl because they dance on the break of the songs. This culture made me who I am today, welcome to the breaking culture.\n\nAlexandre Desane.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY6LptnHMWJuoeAn9unRZtnFdz413P79dWxNuKB8R9Awu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmehsQvdTM5cUKpLY63fJjsCF1JrMLmzQPRRjJRbUmnGok", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY6LptnHMWJuoeAn9unRZtnFdz413P79dWxNuKB8R9Awu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aKiiz1QARnrGHRWRsq3tkUyk3p3U8kioQ"], "tags": ["photography", "35mm", "blackandwhite", "breaking", "hiphop", "dance", "hiphopdance", "bboy", "bgirl", "breakdance", "dancing", "photo", "photez"], "extra": {}}
