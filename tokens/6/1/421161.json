A couple of years ago, I was strolling along an embankment with my artist friend, while we discussed art and its creators. One question in particular drove a wedge between us - what is more important for the creator, passion or patience? After a long discussion, we parted, each with his own opinion. A month later, I made this piece and sent it to him. Unfortunately, our communication has come to naught, however this discussion remains important to me.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY4UzSxBmnGguEvJLKJE1G4MB1LuDL7QdcLED8FczZFh3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcD8tHEDj68y2oCT4JkG5mc3jS134cJ5misk7yvyfUxSL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY4UzSxBmnGguEvJLKJE1G4MB1LuDL7QdcLED8FczZFh3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QqBx7L6Hjbwt3ZsGL7cSUjHmyZmUujAeL"], "tags": ["art", "fashion", "ar", "digital", ""], "extra": {}}
