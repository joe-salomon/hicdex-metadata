It was created using open source data from a lost mask from the Wale\u2019s National Museum. The exact origin of the Mexican mask is unknown to the Museum. It is also not clear how the mask ended up in the museum collections, this lack of information means that the mask has never been on display.\n\nResearch revealed that the original mask is from the Teotihuacan Culture in the central region of M\u00e9xico dating back to the First century \n\nPrehispanic craftsman  mastered the technique of mass customization. They started with basic figures from moulds and then individually decorated each piece to make them more desirable \n\nCantli aesthetics  trace the ancient productions of these ceremonial artefacts  by parting from the \u201cbase\u201d geometry of the 3D scan and then applying selected procedural modifiers to obtain an appleling  appearance.  \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUhxhP1EcDyWh7CUgS7yPT1ndD5yBkkLy3T4KRoenKrJW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeUvru2nPnrGoKQzfwsDSwsXMXtf5LDTeLhNXafLu86t5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUhxhP1EcDyWh7CUgS7yPT1ndD5yBkkLy3T4KRoenKrJW", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1ZBP83qZdQuFGy6eQZwoV7jQq4ozMMhH5k"], "tags": ["3d", "scan", "prehispanic", "immaterial", "mass", "customization", "digital", "artefact", ""], "extra": {}}
