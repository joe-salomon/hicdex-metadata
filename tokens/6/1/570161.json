P. Lovecraft. It was first introduced in his short story \"The Call of Cthulhu\",published by the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. Considered a Great Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, this creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in a shape like a green octopus, dragon, and a caricature of human form. Its name was given to the Lovecraft-inspired universe, the Cthulhu Mythos, where it exists with its fellow entities.\n\n3904x5019 px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXxpzyK2UCa77FQsTDBpfLRGeyv6Jg7Gxk3NGjDwKt9ak", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPRePJKr3cHkNEyChVV5EMikrLLTMejAvMNwD3rq489ZB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXxpzyK2UCa77FQsTDBpfLRGeyv6Jg7Gxk3NGjDwKt9ak", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gaNX4zFdTFSHzRfKd8SX41iSRXMzbSoEi"], "tags": ["Cthulhumythos", "Lovecraftart", "occultart", "digitalillustration", "characterdesign", "Witchesart", "witchcraft", "abraxas", "art"], "extra": {}}
