Underneath the ground there are filaments that connect and expand across the entire forest nourishing and feeding. \n\nThe mushroom is a sign of the deep vast network below. \n\nWhat pops up on the surface is the result of everything that\u2019s gone on underneath. There are vast layers that you cannot see or feel but they are there and they are happening. \n\nThe expansiveness and the unseen workings are there in you.\n\nYou have put information in and have grown a life. In nature we see very clearly the connectedness of everything, the flower chooses its colour to attract the bee and the bee pollinates the flower.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd8UP2btVxuyN6ixbNvAAyfi5WCbzzsWVfujxdsq4PDvU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQRgaA2rHPfV6BzYisXgd2FeFL4wh5iDaR6rWRhUuHpbC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd8UP2btVxuyN6ixbNvAAyfi5WCbzzsWVfujxdsq4PDvU", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
