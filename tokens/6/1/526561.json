As the species itself is part flower, they give back part of the polen they\u2019ve eaten, with even more nutrients, to smaller creatures in their environment.\nIt has been said that Pirropus smells really good, and the oceans they live in have one of the sweetest scents in the universe, a mix of different alien-flowers.
