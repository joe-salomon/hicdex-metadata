I shot this on our way across the street to do a photo of her and her man in a dumpster filled with fabric scraps for our Year Without Clothes project. As happens, during our short walk across the street we saw more of our building neighbors out milling about than any other time I can remember. To be fair, they had kind of come to expect such things by that point so it really wasn't that weird:)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfQU1V5kPEgNJaHD3agsv2SrxNwTCo39YhtFrZutu9m45", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfCxmwRXBiPQoS1YFQR12NU28qSNZa18HVU762mytyTbm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfQU1V5kPEgNJaHD3agsv2SrxNwTCo39YhtFrZutu9m45", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "photographer", "bw", "bnw", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
