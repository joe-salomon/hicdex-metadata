You/\"U\" die and we place You/\"U\" in the word morning. This becomes mourning and we mourn that You/\"U\" are out and the cycle repeats the next morning until You, yourself are the one that dies and they are MOURNING, U OUT. It's a simple pattern of life and death that repeats over and over again, just reduced to its poetic abstract reality.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNq13CSFXVSiGpxQm49eDmrugoLbczbxwvpaye48Ghr5m", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWwyLoFJwk37XTJFbHVvYqwZRTUc7nLj8tbPehPpFguiF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNq13CSFXVSiGpxQm49eDmrugoLbczbxwvpaye48Ghr5m", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
