TNT is valued partly because of its insensitivity to shock and friction, with reduced risk of accidental detonation compared to more sensitive explosives such as nitroglycerin.\n\n!Warning: we do not make any apology for the indiscriminate use any type of explosive! Be safe!.\n\n>> The vibration and movement of these molecules are performed by calculus of simulation called Molecular Mechanics where each molecule optimizes its geometry trying to get the lower energy possible.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTnRDE3rQYSKUimve6Uni9muQ48pYkJLg8vn82GYYL7gr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUfkPrupRQ3eoPCvtmkV23uo81b7m8HrWdLjMxo3Wu6XG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTnRDE3rQYSKUimve6Uni9muQ48pYkJLg8vn82GYYL7gr", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PgPj2SAdBWo5dfJPXpGLZRsi44w2pPjN3"], "tags": ["tezchem", "chemistry", "molecules", "molecular", "vibration", "computing", "substances", "movement", "explosives", "tnt"], "extra": {}}
