Try: in the lies of religion, corporate culture, the discourses of governments and commercialism. Faith No More because there was faith at one time. It is faith lost. Disillusionment. It\u2019s, I used to believe your lies and now I throw them in your face. Sarcasm. Bitterness. Very black and biting humor. There\u2019s room in artistry for such emotions as long as they don\u2019t become an all-consuming cancer, and with FNM something like the opposite happens. Art functions as a form of healing\u2014or at least as a salve to the wound.\n\n4500 X 5700 pixels", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbyYRihDW4cJsaSyqytZbt8A4mdQDtgHJ3ZGec9DrB2sW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYqEffmx6PyTBdWmjCytccJ6uP9CRtrKFgGQZarEo4wZY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbyYRihDW4cJsaSyqytZbt8A4mdQDtgHJ3ZGec9DrB2sW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WpCmiuarDFMHPRMzUiJgFSANApnUG1zjd"], "tags": ["death", "love", "art", "life", "metal", "deathmetal", "dark", "dead", "horror", "sad", "goth", "skull", "blackmetal", "darkart", "black", "gothic", "cemetery", "metalhead", "drawing", "blood", "artist", "grief", "graveyard", "heavymetal", "illustration", "neon", "retro", "love", "faith", "nft", "nfts"], "extra": {}}
