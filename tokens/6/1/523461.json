", "description": "Boulders Beach in Simons Town on the Cape Peninsula has to be one of my favorite places on this planet. I remember walking early in the morning with my Dad counting these penguins for the research being done on them in the mid-80s. We never really got to more than 50 or so ... Now there are hundreds of them everywhere. It is so good to see what we can do to help nature with a bit of effort. These Penguins are an incredible story of how nature and Man can live together", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSCnDw2a4nAaWvKv9BzeubK3cxHx2KJKyyKip2Dy1RGkJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmaa5WJTRwTcop7BfqEimA8cq4yfQcY7WMsvKi8WwtqG57", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSCnDw2a4nAaWvKv9BzeubK3cxHx2KJKyyKip2Dy1RGkJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dT1cPF73Cc51o9pu9CCMiyz9AbmT71Fgs"], "tags": ["Penguin", "JackassPenguin", "SimonsTown", "SouthAfrica"], "extra": {}}
