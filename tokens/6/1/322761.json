{"__version": 1, "token_id": 322761, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Collage #15 ([192] Doctor Death)", "description": "Edward William Pritchard (6 December 1825 \u2013 28 July 1865) was an English doctor who was convicted of murdering his wife and mother-in-law by poisoning them. He was also suspected of murdering a servant girl, but was never tried for this crime. He was the last person to be publicly executed in Glasgow.\nIn 1865, Pritchard poisoned his mother-in-law, Jane Taylor, 70, who died on 28 February. His wife, whom he was treating for an illness (with the help of a Dr. Paterson), died a month later on 18 March at the age of 38. Both had been living at Pritchard's new family home at 131 Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow.\nDr. Paterson was highly suspicious of the \"illnesses\" of both women and, when the time came, refused to sign the death certificates. However, he did not go out of his way to inform the medical or legal authorities of his suspicions.\nPritchard was apprehended after an anonymous letter was sent to the authorities. When the bodies of his wife and mother-in-law were exhumed, it was found that they contained the poison antimony.\nPritchard was convicted of murder after a five-day hearing in\u00a0Edinburgh\u00a0in July 1865, presided over by the\u00a0Lord Justice Clerk,\u00a0Lord Glencorse. He was hanged in front of thousands of spectators at the\u00a0Saltmarket\u00a0end of\u00a0Glasgow Green\u00a0at 8 a.m. on 28 July 1865.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSuwtkKxxmQmCphLoDV3ujnMYeMencVfQAQ2xih2rbb1n", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ5L8zmrdNsrPAqKzAc3YX8ZmocUePG9anwYkHyGvDxZ5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSuwtkKxxmQmCphLoDV3ujnMYeMencVfQAQ2xih2rbb1n", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YTyN2Qi1wfbvFHP3xYiu9mB74ecwXBDUy"], "tags": ["collage", "theartofmann", "death", "skull", "murder", "darkart", "surreal", "192"], "extra": {}}
