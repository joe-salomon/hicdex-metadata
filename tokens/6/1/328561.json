All the objects of the universe are as if pulled together by a thin invisible thread, when broken, the balance will be disturbed and chaos will ensue. Space is a huge space, hardly comprehensible for the human brain, most of it has not been explored at all, it is full of secrets and mysteries.

Each of us has a piece of space, we are space", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc9crnSFjmrG4bMXSoB9Jbz3ZQbxHPwaNGa4f4NAnj7Nw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmduTBEo2E75rdou2qRjAc7iAvj2EijE1MYryryQeXsGpp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc9crnSFjmrG4bMXSoB9Jbz3ZQbxHPwaNGa4f4NAnj7Nw", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hrKKA2yRp6SJaYqvxMrSWCcZxM9Wnue78"], "tags": ["Space", "human", "stars", "astronaut", "sci-fi", "3dart"], "extra": {}}
