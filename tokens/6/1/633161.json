This work is about feeling melancholic and sad: wanting to jump back in time and feel the way you used to. The girl portrayed is not on her guard, holding nothing back.\nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW98wsTjHRTtmZLiJLpKUNhWHrYtctFBYksfjkScGMsS9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYJqUvNuxd7phVwCgc2nBxvL9BTq4xb97G8X7V4JqaQ28", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW98wsTjHRTtmZLiJLpKUNhWHrYtctFBYksfjkScGMsS9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "feelings", "melancholy"], "extra": {}}
