{"__version": 1, "token_id": 327061, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "HOPELESS SEMANTIC", "description": "The old saying, \"Hopeless Romantic\", (a person who holds sentimental and idealistic views on love, especially in spite of experience, evidence, or exhortations otherwise.) always seemed apropos to my work. I love the idea of language. When you get down to the nitty gritty of things, language is incredible. We are living, breathing lumps of flesh on a giant round rock hurtling through spacetime. We are the universe experiencing itself. Every moment of every single day I'm grateful to even be able to wake up, let alone create something. So as a lover of language, especially the English (one of most dynamic languages on the planet). English is one of the few that every year grows almost exponentially; mostly because of all the micro loopholes in its grammar rules. I used to think English was most related to German as a part of the Germanic language group, but I was sorely mistaken by when I read the percentages of the number of type of influences have had on English. What I have discovered is that roughly: 26% is Latin (scientific/medical/legal), 29% is French, 26% is Germanic, 16% are other languages. So does that make English a Romantic Language? Not quite, but that's part of what makes English so amazing! I'm 100% a hopeless semantic. I'm in love with the absolute endless possibilities of it.
