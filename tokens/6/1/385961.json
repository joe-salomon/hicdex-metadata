I told myself after my 30th birthday I will create & post my first digital art piece. Though I wish this was something I pursued in my early 20s..better late than never, right? I still struggle with digital collage & kind of the identity I want to create for this art practice\u2026but looking back at my process & even where I\u2019ve been heading now..I just still feel a little lost with it\u2026BUT searching & learning has been a hell of a fun ride, and even though my life has been in the rut that it\u2019s been in for the last 5 or so years\u2026I\u2019m glad that I started & only hope I will continue to find my new identity, not just in like the artworks, but life. It\u2019s been tough, but these few months have been the most productive & aligned I\u2019ve ever felt in a long time.\n\n@burnedbyairfryer on instagram piece #01 (revisit) (10/10 on tezos chain)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdkHK5tYk9MUThZJC5WyQqxZBp78QBhW3n6YMwEp8Qb4h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRHhF5YarqYwnTUjVXf5MAWAcM5j5FQDXv2aj1xEWxHyS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdkHK5tYk9MUThZJC5WyQqxZBp78QBhW3n6YMwEp8Qb4h", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["digital", "art", "photo", "collage", "first", "may", "2021", "burnedbyairfryer", "no5ay_", "surreal", "personal", "expression", "journey"], "extra": {}}
