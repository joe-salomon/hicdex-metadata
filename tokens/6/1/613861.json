Sometimes those thoughts change over time, as we pass through various stages in our life.

There are so many different styles to explore. But with each piece I mint, it's like a thought in that stream and each style I explore, a bend in that creative river.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXuB6b2LvoaymaiFd1YriknsKW2DDLv1cV43oBBGBkBzV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXuB6b2LvoaymaiFd1YriknsKW2DDLv1cV43oBBGBkBzV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXuB6b2LvoaymaiFd1YriknsKW2DDLv1cV43oBBGBkBzV", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hMpzadgcgpUiDf5N6YXzMmDryWHKkaPuy"], "tags": ["Abstract", "Glitch", "2022", "Waves"], "extra": {}}
