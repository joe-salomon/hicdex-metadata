They're only there so they can swoop in and swipe 50 editions away from community members the second a juicy piece drops. They might think they're being sly, but they're sitting on the blockchain, where everything they do is visible.\n\nThis piece was inspired by a joke made in my small NFT community. We were discussing people like that, and deciding whether they were more like wolves in sheep's clothing, or vultures circling. We settled on both, deciding they were vultures in sheep's clothing, and I set out to draw what that might look like.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSdNyPHRst71Ey6KBBjCKU7mrzwhjmbB7TMVwQEN5Sfjg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTqx9kNrDNDb6ETi72Y9aEjP24njxo5P7q7EpyL2f1qdR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSdNyPHRst71Ey6KBBjCKU7mrzwhjmbB7TMVwQEN5Sfjg", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29ZRzr7Le6QHCpj3WwH67bEBZhfb1edpEo"], "tags": ["illustration", "vultures", "digital", "cartoon", "sheep", "funny", "blockchain"], "extra": {}}
