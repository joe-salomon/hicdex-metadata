These animals generally use their legs very little as they are found flying almost all the time.\nHummingbirds, in their seemingly carefree and happy flight, remind you to live in the moment and enjoy the simple pleasures in life. Also, because they often appear suddenly, they remind you that joy is unpredictable and can be just around the corner; and that, at the same time, can be as fleeting as the time they remain before your eyes. So you have to know how to enjoy every moment.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma7vYbo1LuVtfTc5dngSxYz5notMtUkr2tETPWy6Homxc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZrdZDsYEWVZKmxNunedLKDciPRocF6eQpJMmEnErkA9w", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma7vYbo1LuVtfTc5dngSxYz5notMtUkr2tETPWy6Homxc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2GKP4MSdfPS4ULc7tvysNAQWHt2mBjnxSN"], "tags": ["birds", "edemic", "fauna", "zunzun", "fly", "beautiful", "small", "flower", "green", "photography", "nature", "animals"], "extra": {}}
