{"__version": 1, "token_id": 487467, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sierpi\u0144ski Carpets", "description": "These are 5th-order \"Sierpi\u0144ski Carpet\" fractals, rendered by a surprisingly simple recursive function: a single square is painted at the center of the drawing area, which is then divided into a 3x3 grid; the function then iterates over the 9 cells, calling itself with a constrained drawing area. The recursion goes 5 levels deep to achieve the finer details of the carpets.\n\nA seeded pseudo-random number generator is used to create the color patterns in a deterministic way, meaning a given seed will always generate the same carpet. The seed value is shown at the bottom, whenever you move the mouse over the canvas.\n\nClick the canvas to generate a new random seed or type a 6-digit number to use it as a seed.\n\nUse the Left and Right arrows to navigate through previously generated seeds.\n\nPress the 'S' key to save your favorite carpet and it will be reloaded the next time you open or refresh the page. NOTE: the favorite is saved in your browser storage; if you *really* like a pattern, write the seed down so you won't lose it.\n\nPress the 'X' key to delete a saved favorite and display a random carpet on every page refresh.\n\nSome of my favorite seeds:\n762761, 413714, 751053, 261831, 177496, 366370, 980236\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUhGwWz2Qs2g8QzXPq7VghLuGEBLkMbiAwkMaTQp6ugwT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcqveCb4CVrytaYHTeU1pSj6CLU1XuFcNJc5n9ibRdLR9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUhGwWz2Qs2g8QzXPq7VghLuGEBLkMbiAwkMaTQp6ugwT", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1ghdTMoCNAAo4bqZQwxsWr7RbSgQZdm7wR"], "tags": ["fractal", "generative", "recursive", "recursion", "interactive", "abstract", "pattern"], "extra": {}}
