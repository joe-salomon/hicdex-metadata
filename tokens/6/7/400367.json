On adventures through small towns, point A to point B was seldom straight line. This allowed for unexpected explorations. Sometimes even the language had its own little surprises and rewards. Directions shift as one dives into another culture. Up is Down, Left is Up, and pressing buttons not always lead to the imagined results. Blue was all around, sketch books had to be small. Not a computer in sight other than a hostel or caf\u00e9 of sorts. \nStrange thing is, while searching new found customs one finds a sense of self. These drawings seem satirical, confused, perhaps even angry. Pen to paper, spray to wall, allow one to express experiences without explanation, like an emotion. \nThe psyche is thus examined without judge. Though a traveler might not return to the same village twice, images revisit what was thought. \nNelson X\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNmWdsG2eZzhhtRQJP17R8WksRaYpbENZBhwVpF7BKiQ9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUuRkR4pxtHZHJoSQxMQdDizg9EPNcEbKtmEgGazhAPhH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNmWdsG2eZzhhtRQJP17R8WksRaYpbENZBhwVpF7BKiQ9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Z5Ghyvqu3CR7ffq8pkBYtA6EzyrenEyZ5"], "tags": ["nelsonx", "drawing", "abstract", "surreal", "pen", "paper", "journey", "trip", "travel"], "extra": {}}
