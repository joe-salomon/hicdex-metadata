This is otherwise known as the Far From Origin problem. \n\nthis is a study on avialae, attempting to distill the specificities of any particular species to the morphology of motion and the ability of flight. \n\n1000x1000, 17 frames, .gif, 414KB \n\nmodel credits: \u201cFlapping Eagle\" (https://skfb.ly/onTTp) by AVINAS is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\n@luisfraguada\nhttps://linktr.ee/fraguada", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYLJxaJFENMFvp4X4RCw1d36QUvCRdZSidrTb1NGJowLb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYLJxaJFENMFvp4X4RCw1d36QUvCRdZSidrTb1NGJowLb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYLJxaJFENMFvp4X4RCw1d36QUvCRdZSidrTb1NGJowLb", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SeV6vmY1nR6xuDPXRx1tWsrhqXCwmXL2j"], "tags": ["\ud83e\udeb6", "3d", "iso", "normal", "isometric", "avialae", "arithmetic", "floatingpoint", "precision", "error", "farfromorigin"], "extra": {}}
