Here i am with the second ever Tezo Girl, KYOKI (Madness in Japonese)!\n\nKyoki is the Madness Medusa. In a world which is controlled by technology, cyberwares and big corporations, Kyoki represents disgust to those things.\n\nWhen she was a little girl, the BTC Corporation just kidnapped her to do experiments in her body. \n\nBut when a system failure occurred, she broke her containment glass and with her guts falling out of her belly, she crawled to the outside of the lab, which was then totally blown up.\n\nStill alive because of the cybernetic implants in her body, she knew she didn't have much time left to live. But it was at this moment that Kyoki fell into a strange pink lake, totally toxic due to planet Earth's pollution, and then tentacles enveloped her body, an unknown ancestral force giving her the strength to stay alive, in exchange for her sanity.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeJMYQ3frRN5FkV6knub5MjSVqv7nheqrtdYYKFcMNs87", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbeAVFvsUwBzxfT4J1161amuaqqZsBoQQTU9yWNq3ZkE9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeJMYQ3frRN5FkV6knub5MjSVqv7nheqrtdYYKFcMNs87", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LNPJStnAGnRnx4XGz6Negm7TVfA3ub7ZH"], "tags": ["woman", "cyberpunk", "illustration", "art", "digitalart", "colorful", "pink", "nft", "vaporwave"], "extra": {}}
