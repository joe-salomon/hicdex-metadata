Notice how it forms a perfect elongated diamond or a vertical rhombus shape. From the simple word \"O\", we can keep building and building the form outwards in all 4 directions. This book will have many syntax crystals that will be visually illustrated as works of art. There are other techniques that could be done, like when adding a new letter scrambling all these letters to make a new word, but I prefer at this time to stick to the more traditional way. I like keeping it simple and straight forward, as it makes for a more satisfying experience overall.
