Betrayal of that final goodbye is going to be inevitable and incredibly difficult to explain.\n\nMy relationship with THC as an incredibly socially anxious eclectic being:\n\nThought 1:It\u2019s so wonderful to be alone and just lost in your brain for hours trying to solve mental health problems.\n\nThought 2: But there is no way that you can do this on any social level. This can\u2019t be a functional common life practice, correct?\n\nAnswer: Once you\u2019ve allowed yourself to open up to others, you\u2019ll find it\u2019ll become easier over time. And care less about the thoughts and views that are perplexed by your new outlook on life. Not trusting yourself on THC around others is just about your own self doubts and capabilities, and it\u2019s time to betray those weights that have held me down for so long.\n\nHaving a platform to speak on, in which millions that can happen upon at any given time:\n\nThought 1: Play it safe, Shill, Be Polite, don\u2019t engage too closely and expose your true self.\n\nThought 2: Put yourself out there, embarrassing or not. Share your every day thoughts and revelations, If you make a mistake, You\u2019ve just learned something you wouldn\u2019t have learned whilst playing it safe.\n\nAnswer: Betray those feelings of locking yourself in a box shielded from the worries of people actually learning who you really are at this moment in time.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf4XpDsmbwuykzDE96TnZSv5ABNSUxcDVBFA59Ywy3rzf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZEtAHKpb6omNoUVYfrDjnoUWZNn1rwDgE8TxhMScUnLj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf4XpDsmbwuykzDE96TnZSv5ABNSUxcDVBFA59Ywy3rzf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LiKcgzMA8E75vHtrr3wLk5Sx7r3GyMDNe"], "tags": ["spokenword", "poetry", "innerthoughts", "betrayal", "openness", "visualpoetry"], "extra": {}}
