But compared to these earlier media, photographs possessed an almost magical verisimilitude.\n\nMany postmortem photographs are hard to look at. They\u2019re too graphic or too desperate in their attempts to simulate life. But others provide an almost visceral connection to the past.\n\nBy @dehiscenceart, 2021\nJPG, 5400px X 7200px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeU3V4PCev2Sx8uHCLuvwkprRwMy8FzRGggo3p2qJD64u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTUpatWjb91aKJxCk1W7F5gVt7jjtm5cYjYsDfrkZkKws", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeU3V4PCev2Sx8uHCLuvwkprRwMy8FzRGggo3p2qJD64u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lb6Wi2SJUwt3pkruYCVzDYEQVk6b51fDB"], "tags": ["ganart", "ghost", "death", "postmortem", "grief", "vqganclip", "vqgan", "victorian", "royal", "aiart", "gan", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
