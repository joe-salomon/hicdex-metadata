{"__version": 1, "token_id": 350167, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Flaming Jo", "description": "Minted for Hiceturco 2 event, this digital painting based on a previous life drawing. The pose has a resemblance to Frederic Leighton's Flaming June and the model's name was Jo, hence the title. But unlike Flaming June's fluid structure, this painting is more geometric with lines meeting each other in sharp angles. In a way it resembles Turkish artist Turhan Selcuk's Abdulcanbaz characters.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcHyBtYiNUtKnW8Y9pVwt6JTaS5h46hnfPu4hjMGngm5N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmandADSku5imxTBSrBYwsveegNG7BTsu7oXVyxtNbNcqr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcHyBtYiNUtKnW8Y9pVwt6JTaS5h46hnfPu4hjMGngm5N", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Xh1J9JRQqh37HB2C1eFtjFpf21vXsBaMu"], "tags": ["hiceturco2", "lifedrawing", "figurative", "figuredrawing"], "extra": {}}
