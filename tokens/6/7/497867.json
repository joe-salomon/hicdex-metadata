From afar, they are abstract symbols of stability and status. Up close, the serenity is captured perfectly with the cool indigo blue hues. \n\nThe expression goes on almost to infinity, seamlessly stretching across the platform. It appears as though they are words forming sentences and telling a story from a writer's angle, instead of a visual artist. \n\nPresented individually in separate volumes, the presentation of the artwork and digital animation represents focused integration within an improved structure. It also emulates written books presented in volumes. \n\nInspired by the strength of Capitaland Group, the bold movements in the digital animation depicts motion and fluidity reminiscent of water and its strength. Together with the artwork, its purpose is to provoke its viewers with wonder and inspire for many generations to come.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZpAyeo3WUwThYEzgUYK5CV2WeM7mWyuWan9YvFjFQBvd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ7NHDm8A9ZKZVtubchsHZnpf2uxdJXzWMgnTfrigbSZa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZpAyeo3WUwThYEzgUYK5CV2WeM7mWyuWan9YvFjFQBvd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NgGzyTyjWnwkWWhgJcWgxDsLRFxPgfXam"], "tags": ["capitaland"], "extra": {}}
