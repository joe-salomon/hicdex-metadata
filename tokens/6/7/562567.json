It represents all about Dhamma without putting any symbolic religion.\n\nYou just a watcher. You never exist in this game. You just TeamViewer from the headquarter to your avatar and control it, playing in the illusion world. Your body is not belonging to you. You just feel it but do not go too far. You will be free from every effect in the game. You can feel hurt but will not suffer. You can feel angry but not let it burn yours. You can fear but you will not scare. When you realize that you are just a robot or Avatar, you will be free from illusion. And when you die, your Avatar just broken but your soul will restart the game again finding new map, new story, and new role. When you unplug yourself out of this game, you will not back into this game again. You will be free from the cycle of life and death forever. AND THIS IS THE REAL HAPPINESS \u2026\u2026  EMPTINESS\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW3fNDxpNZJfmxT71evg1LKYrxv3qyUk4sGVZVcAvSYLo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZxh1YBmAvfoGxMDHJeAThfYrmA3F6u3xWyEwatES3fW9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW3fNDxpNZJfmxT71evg1LKYrxv3qyUk4sGVZVcAvSYLo", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MwJWhDDjVnGE7MQ23jgwFUuGbvtxb7NoE"], "tags": ["2d", "3d", "drawing"], "extra": {}}
