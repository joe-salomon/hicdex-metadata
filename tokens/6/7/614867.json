Phosphenes that appears by chance on the retina and fades into fractals like a Penrose mosaic on the floor of a cathedral, explaining to us the nature of the sunflower or Romanesco. To what these perfect edges, ceilings and walls have brought you. Can you discuss your clamps with a square vacuum cleaner. What the hell is this game, when yesterday you are still a puppy and play with other puppies in the litter box, and after a couple of million years, you become an upright and flat-sleeping leather bag and your game resembles social roulette. Cheese board or hockey board, chessboard outline or chalk - you are playing too. You played with your feathers on your helmet and in armor. Forgetting to think of Arabic zero in beautiful Roman numerals. Range, my friend, is not a straight scale or even a sphere. That's all you want. The hypercube in the spider's eyes is what range is.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRj9bCXtFpEy4vvXbWzX5FtZDofKRoCrJ4XPCBhs4J8HP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRj9bCXtFpEy4vvXbWzX5FtZDofKRoCrJ4XPCBhs4J8HP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRj9bCXtFpEy4vvXbWzX5FtZDofKRoCrJ4XPCBhs4J8HP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LG4G9SuaVTQxBeFJ4M6FJQXCVMUuLKdm4"], "tags": ["pixelart", "8bit", "gameart", "cyberpunk", "acid", "landscape", "future", "retrowave"], "extra": {}}
