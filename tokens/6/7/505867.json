They were also featured in a show commissioned by the Museum of Contemporary Art Busan - 05-09 2021.\nThis work was made in collaboration with Tom Johnson and Heinrich Schwarzer. \nThese are some pieces of things. Fragments of the stuff that makes up everything. Maybe they do things together? Maybe they are keys for a lock not yet made?...\n\nThis one however, is special.\n\nIt is made as a special prize both as part of #hen500k but also as a prize to all holders of the project. Congratulations!\n\n500 will be minted, and available @ 0.5 tez for 50 hours from 12.00pm GMT  14/11/2021. good luck!!!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPbFE3CXV8f9SyYHBdDj1qDzUGuiC8XEHCbazzGvBGq1u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbKcxAA18x6ausVVd9Xh4Ca3Ku5WCCzhN6uj2JF6Ce4Gm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPbFE3CXV8f9SyYHBdDj1qDzUGuiC8XEHCbazzGvBGq1u", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1UB1pD7xwUWKqQby1p1cKnuw9Ts3Cb8Ax4"], "tags": ["hen500k", "#hen500k", "slime", "collectible", "moca", "cleannft", "key", "totheghostnets", "lewkwilmshurst", "ttgn", "treasure", "slimys", "moca", "busan", "Tomjohnson", "HeinrichSchwarzer", ""], "extra": {}}
