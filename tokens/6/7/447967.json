{"__version": 1, "token_id": 447967, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "I PONDER; I WONDER; I WANDER; OVER YONDER.", "description": "I spend most of my time pondering, wondering, and wandering through nature on the Tsuut'ina First Nations reservation just outside of Calgary, Alberta in Canada. I go on walks with between 5-10 dogs (depending on which rez dogs are around to follow me at that time) and think about an array of ideas and concepts. I read news about science, math, physics, theoretical breakthroughs. I read art reviews from Jerry Saltz and others. I pick sage and inhale the soft scent of sage that helps connect me to the ancestors of peoples of the land on which I'm privileged enough to walk on. I'm so grateful for my unique opportunity and circumstance of me being here. I ask for guidance and try to right the wrongs of the past by being a better, more compassionate human to their people and to myself. Words come to me and I'm present to their power and magic. The stories write themselves; I'm merely the scribe to document the moment. If I come off as insecure, it is because I am. This book is incredibly personal to me and has been a work in progress for over 20 years. I take everything I do very seriously and contemplate every letter / word / phrase / punctuation / color / gradient. I am always afraid that I will not be taken seriously, as most of my life no one really believed in much of what I was doing. Then again, you need to surround yourself with the right people. For a long time, I neglected my art and worked for my family's business for almost 15 years. For 3 of those years, I worked 7 days a week and took no vacations. All for what? But, I now have the life experience from that time to teach me the value of self-worth, boundaries, and truth. Not just any truth, but truth about reality, about the universe, about language, about truth itself. I like to ask the really big hard questions and ponder them in earnest, by myself. It's a type of loneliness that is satisfying and productive.
