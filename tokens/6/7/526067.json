This is a series of 100 NFTs over 100 days, all broken screens, all 1/1!  I don\u2019t know if this will be successful, but I\u2019m inspired by the idea of working on art daily in order to build momentum.  I have shelves of broken screens I have collected, so this will be a way to force myself to photograph them.\n\nTo provide context for the images, I will occasionally post ancillary photos of the broken devices involved on Twitter @rdklinc.  I will mint on a daily basis and at a random time.  I generally avoid apps and effects, using only minor color correction, and I often put my own photography behind the broken screens to bring out the colors.  \n\nThanks for looking!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbKu2mgm4uuLEWngagVPsjD3sEHJYSuYQsRZu6kuiVW5t", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdMzzR1fwoRX6VkMvANsyDo93YHKS1nU96V4Myu6DiXTJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbKu2mgm4uuLEWngagVPsjD3sEHJYSuYQsRZu6kuiVW5t", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Pm55U5NxqFaoMe3CSJHFkqYzRUkhyyQcL"], "tags": ["abstract", "brokenscreenoftheday", "bsotd010", "photography", "glitch", "glitchart", "brokenscreen", "rdklinc", "abstractart", "bsotd"], "extra": {}}
