{"__version": 1, "token_id": 550967, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Purity", "description": "The body painting, tells the model's story. Sylva is a muse regarded with love, hate, joy, envy, as well as hope. The white rose reflects a similar conflict with its beauty; petals and thorns, upon a mother of pearl clamshell --both representing purity. A pure beauty is revealed; one that is almost untouchable and etherial. It becomes an aesthetic that reaches beyond the physical. Sylva is a true to life siren, she radiates beauty and possesses an eccentric magnetism that people from all walks of life sense. Sylva has a genuinely adventurous spirit and has experienced things that ordinary people might fear and has done things that ordinary people would never do. She is unquestionably honest, loyal, fearless, shameless, and beautiful. She represents the things most strive to be.\n\nBehind the Scenes video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqAAUmKZXbY\n\nheadpiece by bubblesandfrown.etsy.com\nmodel: Sylva\n\nbody paint and photography by Roustan (bodypainter.com)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNY3XDiaGfSUStDm9zjkA7P6Y9aZFaJnUiufDpAXx8G3C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX4xzKHZuNQweegtAmkzD6JsX54TiHFboAUZQ5GoHUaUh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNY3XDiaGfSUStDm9zjkA7P6Y9aZFaJnUiufDpAXx8G3C", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QUmGXc9smSXGAgtJ3MG6LseXc5T4Ztdgm"], "tags": ["rose", "bodypaint", "nsfw", "model", "female", "woman", "artnude", "photography", "white", "purity", "pure"], "extra": {}}
