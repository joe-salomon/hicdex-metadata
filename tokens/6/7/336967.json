Be a witness to the wonder and delight as we recreate our own version of the magic brought to you by the exchange of Immersive ART EXPERIENCES, BUMPIN BEATS AND HEALING VIBRATIONS. With all three collectives bringing the best they have to offer we will have hand-crafted goods by amazing vendors, live artists, flow artists, experience creators and many more wondrous surprises.\n\n______\nPhotography by Sebuh Honarchian while attending Silk Road Mojave Desert Gathering 2021\n\nThis is a photo of the Main Stage at Silk Road 2021.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRqCGf8xjuPhLm6mc96tqMjJKBxndWrLtAHFAgKH3rAo8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbqnaDXGMt61phCtDseZkdPKTjaLnZcFA6FAjp8xRXiRG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRqCGf8xjuPhLm6mc96tqMjJKBxndWrLtAHFAgKH3rAo8", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NufWtpqS3nfR8VW1xFyWq4GWqb969keeR"], "tags": ["Stage", "Photograph", "Photo", "LongExposure", "Rave", "Music", "Festival", "Desert", "Mojave"], "extra": {}}
