It's pretty obvious of how much I love this show. This particular excerpt is from Season 7: Episode 8 'The Monkey Show'. Backstory time...Dorothy finally liberates herself from her ex-husband Stan. At the same time her sister Gloria shows up and winds up sleeping with Stan. At the same time her sister Gloria shows up and winds up sleeping with Stan. During the episode we discover that Gloria is out of money and there is a conversation that ensues regarding it. The structure of the sentence of SHE'S NOT OUT OF MONKEY, STAN; SHE'S OUT OF MONEY is balanced perfection. Visually when we limit the words on a particular line, we get visual balance. There's also the play on MONKEY/MONEY that adds to the humor of the moment. A funny moment, from funny actors, from a funny episode of a very funny show.
