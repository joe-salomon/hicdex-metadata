Please Stand By, A Virus Escaped My Lab. On February 27th, 2020, 27 prominent scientists published a letter in the scientific journal the Lancet decrying the theory that COVID 19 does not have a natural origin. But since then several scientists have stepped back those comments and believe it did indeed escape from a research lab. This research is important and can save lives, but the safety precautions that should take place are also very important.  In the years since SARS was contained almost all cases have been attributed to lab leaks, 6 leaks across 3 countries. We must do better to hold the scientific community to high standards of safety precaution while simultaneously allowing them to continue their research that could save countless lives.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcfAe8yvUHnXkniovhcjeYVRgvBQyBhxAoaQ392zRvNU2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQS6WkUcsbuy8Y6TFA7TB9VuuR7SmygQu8pteDUXXbuXn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcfAe8yvUHnXkniovhcjeYVRgvBQyBhxAoaQ392zRvNU2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "TV"], "extra": {}}
