They are the product of a hunting diary where we record our creative drifts through the city of Buenos Aires. It is linked to our series \"HackUs 575\".\nAround the text of poetic microfiction, an integrated artistic work is built, that joins word, digital collage and free musical improvisation on violin, to create a powerful and sublime experience.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPrpTexfbuDwzoBX7mWGYEh1KKWDniuNt5p5SSxRsoGXB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcsNZnXzmn2Mev5hpLrHmfJXyqDm4z79MuFTdSWmgNFx7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPrpTexfbuDwzoBX7mWGYEh1KKWDniuNt5p5SSxRsoGXB", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Y9oRFW5yhCzuZvQx7kwZkDsSSXXDJhXHV"], "tags": ["video", "poetry", "music", "collage"], "extra": {}}
