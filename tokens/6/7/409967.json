I found out about his photographs already when I was shooting with a Polaroid.\nWhen Patti Smith's book \"Just Kids\" came out, I read it excitedly and from there I learned that my birthday was on the same day that Robert had. \n\nI got up early in the morning and looked at the wilting flowers, which my beloved gave me, I remembered about Robert, and asked Misha to pose for photo with the flowers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQmm3GhwyEpqxxg3m6s89PHLRXy5NhMRmm39yLL3TQLAS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZYQGs1iQ8bNGGaePMK7UfsavpG9MLcV19nuWZom1ce3r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmQmm3GhwyEpqxxg3m6s89PHLRXy5NhMRmm39yLL3TQLAS"}], "creators": ["tz1d5HE9dWCn6ciiSgLRvfegDiHyMUt6oo4w"], "tags": ["blackandwhite", "polaroid", "diary", "halopolaroiddiary"], "extra": {}}
