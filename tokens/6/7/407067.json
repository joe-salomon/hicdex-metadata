Oops, sorry! But, you must also be getting emotional in love when you see the two of them, right? Let's introduce them, they are The Lovers, created by God to be attracted to each other.\n\nAs we can see, they are two people who are in love, who have nothing to hide, who are soul mates and made for each other. The woman represents the emotional side and the man represents the logical side within a person. It shows a strong bond between them. The Lovers are like telling us that \"the world feels like ours, just the two of us\". Behind them, there is a huge and warm sun that represents joy, energy, and passion.\n\nThe Lovers is the sixth card in the Major Arcana. The number 6 itself represents harmony and balance. They want to tell you the importance of finding balance in your life.\n\n*This item is available only as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).
