This little girl was very curious of what I'm doing in her neighborhood. She's a very shy girl. I remember she always hide when I point my camera to her, so I let her peek me and I took this photo. It's a split second moment between me and the shutter button either I took it or it'll gone forever. That's a beautiful moment to remember for me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmeu17ZbHsKwwET2eg7JJvSPzRjfjzfQcncmmsiaMuh41k", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVENtW1sBep6RBB8Cj2k6h2p42Ej9mFNxBvZnynvKgo7a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmeu17ZbHsKwwET2eg7JJvSPzRjfjzfQcncmmsiaMuh41k", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gQ5MzUiSa36UnwZy6EXCTXaT3aoMpxJm9"], "tags": ["blackandwhite", "photography", "nft", "street", "photo"], "extra": {}}
