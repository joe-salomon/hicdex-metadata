{"__version": 1, "token_id": 535967, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Kabasaran", "description": "Kabasaran is a war dance from the Minahasa region, North Sulawesi. This dance is a traditional Minahasa warrior dance, which is taken from the word; Wasal, which means a rooster whose comb is cut off so that the rooster becomes more fierce in fighting.\n\nThis dance is accompanied by the sound of drums and/or small gongs. Percussion instruments such as Gong, Tambur or Kolintang are called \"Pa 'Wasalen\" and the dancers are called Kawasaran, which means dancing by imitating the movements of two fighting roosters, almost similar to the Cakalele dance from Maluku.\n\nThe word Kawasalan later developed into \"Kabasaran\" which is a combination of the two words \"Kawasal ni Sarian\" \"Kawasal\" means accompanying and following the dance movements, while \"Sarian\" is a war leader who leads a traditional Minahasa warrior dance. The development of the Manado Malay language then changed the letter \"W\" to \"B\" so that the word changed to Kabasaran, which actually has nothing to do with the word \"big\" in Indonesian, but eventually became a pick-up dance for the dignitaries.\n\nIn ancient times the Kabasaran dancers only became dancers at traditional ceremonies. However, in their daily life they are peasants and ordinary people. When Minahasa is in a state of war, the Kabasaran dancers become Waraney.\n\nMP4 1080 1080 px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcvsQjt89bxp586TUWAenDcvt75vyejyfdQpdCBRKNU7y", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd5ChwDfybrL69P3cmrw9DsGPoNXnocFqGVDBuVDkc9Ru", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcvsQjt89bxp586TUWAenDcvt75vyejyfdQpdCBRKNU7y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2W9u6UAPompBhXfeNBFEWNmCdhFRK9JJeA"], "tags": ["sint.maryindonesianculture"], "extra": {}}
