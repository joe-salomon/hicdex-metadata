Cheche is a city that has never seen the sun. The whole region is filled with robots and doesn't include any other life form except passing tourists. In the center of this place is Labe, the connecting console. Using its intergalactic antennas, Labe explores the past and the future to capture the players' experiences. It then creates games based on the life of each user. The rule is simple, each player gets to replay moments of his life through mini games. Players re-live previous experiences and get the chance to learn from their mistakes. The game changer is that players are allowed to join each other's adventures and strengthen their bond. They also live adventures of the future, which helps them avoid upcoming hurdles. The friendship between Dino and Jaru intensifies. Unlocking this Magical Item will increase your Gaming Attribute by 810 MPs.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcQBLt3v4RnmrzWeFjdxbQBv4augr6PQGBEqfNGd8pQpa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRh1k3XVc3LZMtWRpqEL24N7MG6kxx1y5uM3NvUHjM4Xd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcQBLt3v4RnmrzWeFjdxbQBv4augr6PQGBEqfNGd8pQpa", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VqHv7mttoPSQUoixT3ahGQuN5HGgBXFHT"], "tags": ["fantasy", "2d", "animation", "color", "colorful", "sci-fi", "video", "doodle", "Digital", "illustration", "ultrarare", "Collectibles", "Magical"], "extra": {}}
