Finally I got a lemon girl with one purple pentacle on her forehead, reminded me of the green witch. During touching up with digital painting, the lemon girl told me to add more pentacle to make it more powerful! The Ten of pentacle card\u2019s means you will have a strong foundation, security and a happy life.    So I wish you a perfect happiness and abundance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPeynySebVPkNnKsyVYvzG2ygFa1FKMUHXNGfnMZQo5Je", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbLCkPKtGRwQAHAQFpUSQXyD6YVaLiZUTyV9gFBiXuWme", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPeynySebVPkNnKsyVYvzG2ygFa1FKMUHXNGfnMZQo5Je", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T6zR9eTumSHiskDg33NvC1XfNfXx6J4YB"], "tags": ["Tarot", "girl", "yellow", "luck", "fortune"], "extra": {}}
