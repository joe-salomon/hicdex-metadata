The world neither looked like black and white movies in the early 1900s, nor like impressionist paintings in the late 1800s. But what if it did? What would the world have looked like in the Impressionist era? This artwork depicts the world as perceived by an impressionist. The artwork was created using an AI-art model trained primarily on impressionist paintings by Claude Monet, as well as works of other prominent impressionist and post-impressionist artists, including Paul C\u00e9zanne and Vincent van Gogh.
