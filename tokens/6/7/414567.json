Unlike the exoticism of urbex, this series seeks to expose forgotten or ignored elements of our environment that are hidden in plain sight; to uncover the beauty in the mundane.\n \nThis series was born out of a desire to combat my depression, when even taking a walk seemed a Herculean undertaking.  Passing through many of the same surroundings day after day I began to forge a connection with scenes and vignettes that were at first glance easy to pass over. In sharing these images, I hope to inspire a similar connection in others.
