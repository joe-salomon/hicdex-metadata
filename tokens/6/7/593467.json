Please Stand By, For A Multiverse Of Madness. The Multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes called parallel or alternate universes where the laws of physics may be different thus sprouting out different outcomes across universes. \u201cThis idea of multiple universes, or multiple realities, has been around in philosophical circles for centuries. The scientific justification for it, however, is new.\u201d  The idea of the multiverse is based on two independent, well-established, and widely-accepted aspects of theoretical physics: the quantum nature of everything and the properties of cosmic inflation. There's no known way to measure it, just as there's no way to measure the unobservable part of our Universe. But the two theories that underlie it, inflation and quantum physics, have been demonstrated to be valid. If they're right, then the multiverse is an inescapable consequence of that, and we're living in it. However because we cannot test this theory the scientific community remains very skeptical, believing that without quantifiable proof this theory could deteriorate confidence in the scientific community. So while it may be fun to imagine different worlds where a decision we made sprouted off a new parallel universe where my NFT\u2019s are worth millions science believes it\u2019s not probable. Colors inspired by Spiderman No Way Home and it\u2019s fun and exciting exploration of the multiverse.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZAc5M9gqGTNmUzirrJgkkkmKZqcJGuyEwSrrAiWyivhQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSKA6F5Wco5wyaemS6q3dLRdwuWZd4JsQKiGbbAvaqwcd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZAc5M9gqGTNmUzirrJgkkkmKZqcJGuyEwSrrAiWyivhQ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television"], "extra": {}}
