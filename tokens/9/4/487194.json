Once I started experimenting with the tape warp, I knew the possibilities could be endless to make it look different.  This dollface collection are the coolest moments I created & then had even more fun with in after effects.  \n\nThe score is a fun little ditty I made one afternoon-- once I started warping the playback time, I realized how many different dimensions/environments/feelings I could create from the progression.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTAc5cggW17WDQYBJAx7PvhTbXPW1Mg2G1n8mwjVp3WVa", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmey5zPCUmArhT9HXRVz3Umwko2a8V2WKvcMu1D8igkA51", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTAc5cggW17WDQYBJAx7PvhTbXPW1Mg2G1n8mwjVp3WVa", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2AeW9LBeEZWXMrT5FMqH96tUq3kPxK3BPn"], "tags": ["videoart", "henhalloween", "creepy", "glitch", "vhs", "color", "colorful", "video", "spooky", "retro"], "extra": {}}
