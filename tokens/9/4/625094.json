It was created to depict the colorful, unique birds living in the tropical forests also called tropical rainforests found in lowlands and highlands near the equator. Due to disappearing habitats through deforestation, many of the birds have been classified as \"endangered\" or \"high risk for extinction\". The image was created with the assistance of a text prompt, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. The image may be interpreted differently through the eyes and imagination of the viewers.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRz9CvvJJkvo9hjg1JwsgSu4BZJSYJiSSRG36e88c3ZHo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdyuxKDfgZnETRfU6SnDvBNhDfZi9oBPVipVX7ddfv4Gz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRz9CvvJJkvo9hjg1JwsgSu4BZJSYJiSSRG36e88c3ZHo", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XQeAkWGur8esmmuChxBN5VTZk4X3Z48gH"], "tags": ["jungle", "tropical", "equator", "trees", "nature", "deforestation", "endangered", "flying", "rainforest", "forest", "birds"], "extra": {}}
