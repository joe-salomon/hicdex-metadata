This concept refers to the foundations of the practice of lucid dreaming as formulated by the Toltecs and Incas.\n\nIn technical terms, the work was done in an analogous way using an airbrush, liquid acrylic and industrial alcohol.\nThe sketch for the painting was made on a computer. All digital effects are created in editors and then reproduced with paints on canvas.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifwp5j2vrteprwldxtmmki7c3iu6w372b4yd46q7umgeb47zvpuiq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiffl4rat3zkujbgxcocz3bcmostecerdvwcfvhidmuewdxrt7lesy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifwp5j2vrteprwldxtmmki7c3iu6w372b4yd46q7umgeb47zvpuiq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XPii2HoNJP1Qst7ukue1k9PVeKscP9qBe"], "tags": ["edgarinvoker", "acrylic", "airbrush", "fineart", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
