Filters have been inserted in the higher layers of GANs, to disrupt, invert, and twist the image formation process at its very earliest incarnation. As the distorted formations cascade down through the rest of the GAN, it produces highly detailed imagery from the corrupted formations, resulting in images that have the photo-realistic qualities of portraits, but with impossible distortions and formations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXctqJ1D4asCxGNAgDYkhqiWTFvQrbRp2NF7qkwXKGuc7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXctqJ1D4asCxGNAgDYkhqiWTFvQrbRp2NF7qkwXKGuc7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXctqJ1D4asCxGNAgDYkhqiWTFvQrbRp2NF7qkwXKGuc7", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YEm99nkwMsLgd5f9KsoYwAZQUmFUeH9Md"], "tags": ["aiart", "networkbending", "deeplearning", "machinelearning", "gan", "impossibleimage", "impossibleportrait", "terencebroad"], "extra": {}}
