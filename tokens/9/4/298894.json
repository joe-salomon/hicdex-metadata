{"__version": 1, "token_id": 298894, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Voodoo doll ", "description": "The term Voodoo doll commonly describes an effigy into which pins are inserted. Such practices are found in various forms in the magical traditions of many cultures across the world. Although the use of the term Voodoo implies that the practice is linked to Haitian Vodou or Louisiana Voodoo, it is not prominent in either.\n\nThe link between this magical practice and Voodoo was established through the presentation of the latter in Western popular culture, enduring the first half of the 20th century. In this, the myth of this magical practice being closely linked to Voodoo and Vodou was promoted as part of the wider negative depictions of blacks and Afro-Caribbean religious practices in the United States. In John Houston Craige's 1933 book Black Bagdad: The Arabian Nights Adventures of a Marine Captain in Haiti, he described a Haitian prisoner sticking pins into an effigy to induce illness. Its use also appeared in film representations of Haitian Vodou such as Victor Halperin's 1932 White Zombie and Jacques Tourneur\u2019s 1943 I Walked with a Zombie. Voodoo dolls are also featured in the films Lisztomania and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\n\nreference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_doll\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifshg6i7ilvxfpfhfkimv5ocggtwuveuijpmyyuedwu6t7o2465d4", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreicdqf6mmogp74jjsk5ixl3hw5gte3pnrp35g3s2d6evjf3fokooqy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifshg6i7ilvxfpfhfkimv5ocggtwuveuijpmyyuedwu6t7o2465d4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PTbafFgKp7irKbGsxwVtkUiYWNNF2ajmj"], "tags": ["voodoodoll", "voodoo", "witchcraft", "witch", "blackmagick", "magick", "witches", "spells", "lovespell", ""], "extra": {}}
