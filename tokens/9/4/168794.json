The objkt is formed by 36 gifs that will change each time they are collected, through the interaction with the blockchain's data, resulting in each collector owning an unique image. This operation takes into account the collective effort to transform or resignify an idea during a period of time.\nBecoming-body is part of the serie of works Distant bodies still in Friction.\nNote that this is an experiment that depends on API calls, in case it breaks in the future, we'll get in touch with the collectors in order to replace the objkt for a new version.\nProject developed during TIBUM residency.\nCreators: J\u00e9ssica Luz @softdread2021 & Carlos de Oliveira Junior @vamoss\nJuly, 2021\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUVvDshK5yc3DEtTcJiZvBeb65j8XeqH9ZupHuYQX9NR8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeZhNjVskD9uNa7MvoKgWpEya2nDHrWJnd3S3Ayx2iuyh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmdN5w46veZ3xHXAeVCuaTP4qHzShwrHHjS1j8BVeMxZwL", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUVvDshK5yc3DEtTcJiZvBeb65j8XeqH9ZupHuYQX9NR8", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1Wbaii4z9X6RxUiuTHEdjZC7DRBCGgYagw"], "tags": ["interactive", "animation", "distantbodiesstillinfriction", "creativecoding", "tibum", "tibumresidency"], "extra": {}}
