But before that, you're going to meet the fourth ever Tezo Girl: REIJI!\n\nRESILIENCE (Rejiriensu) - the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness.\n\nTwenty years ago when the BTC Company exploded its techno-organic bomb in a small village, they didn't count on anyone surviving.\n\nAnd then, becoming a handicapped person with no arms and crawling to seek any kind of help, Reiji is rescued by the XTZ alliance.\n\nRaised as a professional assassin, today she uses the remnants of organic technology in her body along with her guided hands to end the tyranny of the BTC Company. \n\nThis nft is a tribute to people with physical disabilities.
