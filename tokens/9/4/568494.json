The President Elect was Joe Biden. The President Reject was Donald J. Trump. For the first time in years there was genuine hope that change was coming. Real structural and societal change. Oh the new year was bound to better than the hot dumpster fire that 2020 was...right? Uhhhh not quite...in 11 days from this date we saw the true spirit and zeal of Trump's supporters' hate and rage.
