I was doing some research on them and I found out that they make a really unique type of paint. after about 2-5 years, they become luminescent and creates a really unique glow in the moon light. So, I crushed a a few down and painted this painting for you to hang up in your home and eventually it will have a really unique feature that people will awe over every time they come to your meta home. I painted 5 of these so consider yourself lucky.
