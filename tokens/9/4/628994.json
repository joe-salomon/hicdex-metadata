{"__version": 1, "token_id": 628994, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "PEEK KING", "description": "PEEK KING is the first cubicle experiment on a modular level for a syntax crystal. By positioning the crystals in such a lattice structure and added 3 strings, we have successfully created the illusion of three blocks sitting on a floor. This also creates a completely separate image of crystals floating above a layered lattice of crystals laying horizontal connected by strings. As we journey into more and more complex structures that lie within, we discover a whole new universe of possibilities, as absurd as they may be. I particularly love these and will be experimenting more in the near future.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaHV89xX9vuEq1LLq3DbdxvozhAqtRR1zZuCmxrdMhp1N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXvK4fzVTRga1v3GryHk4zgPnXHSQcssHdceucxEJYtnT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaHV89xX9vuEq1LLq3DbdxvozhAqtRR1zZuCmxrdMhp1N", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
