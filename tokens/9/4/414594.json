Frightened, the Maasai nomads who lived there fled.\n\nOn their return, they found very shiny blue stones on the ground. They brought the mysterious stones to a local explorer who, unable to identify them, sent them to a gemologist in Arusha in northern Tanzania.\n\nHe was also unable to identify them and, in turn, sent them to his father, also a gemologist, who lived in New York.\n\nIn the United States, the stones were analyzed at the GIA (Gemological Institute of America, world reference in gemmology) which rendered the following verdict : the stones were a blue variety, hitherto unknown, of zoisite, a gem that does not was until then known only in a brownish color.\n\nExposed to a temperature of 600 degrees, the stones had taken and kept a blue verging on purple, unique.\n\nA few years later, the owner of Tiffany & Co jewelry, H. Pratt, fell head over heels in love with the Zoisites of Tanzania and renamed them Tanzanites, in homage to their country of origin.\n\nArtwork make with AI // 1080x1080 // MetaTanzanite // Created by Roman Guillermo // 10.10.2021 // romanguillermo.tez", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmadYypMgmgcuy7Sj27h6xxp6bZjA4DaxAJtmL15Ry32WQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmadYypMgmgcuy7Sj27h6xxp6bZjA4DaxAJtmL15Ry32WQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmadYypMgmgcuy7Sj27h6xxp6bZjA4DaxAJtmL15Ry32WQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1RUEhqJV6SKcr59vZWoR47iW45EUnDavoH"], "tags": ["gems", "abstract", "digitalart", "tanzanite", "generariveart", "AI", "HDR", "colorfull"], "extra": {}}
