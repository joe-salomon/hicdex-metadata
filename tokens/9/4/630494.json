On the one hand, I design my own experiment, on the other hand, I assign unambiguous functions that create shapes, and in that way I create a new challenging process in my new media practice of creation.\nThe generative approach to art provides new fields of expression, and thus new insights into moving personal and professional boundaries, through the daily use of new tools and the work environment.\nFrom the self-portrait photograph, which is the initial reference of this work, I made a raster that rotates vertically by 360 degrees. The result is an animation and a series of digital drawings (given 360 images / frames). Each recorded drawing is exactly one degree of a full circle, but also an image that has \"life\". out of that circle.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcgpUeVDox2d9eJCboZfeiXRrcgWXTpLeSi9ud9kKUJEg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaHpbQUepu8F6zZu4GTT37QSiP9sHWHymmQFLRWTvKuTA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcgpUeVDox2d9eJCboZfeiXRrcgWXTpLeSi9ud9kKUJEg", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1disvkhyo7B8YAGJTmpuXyBUai3eRw3yHw"], "tags": ["processing", "creativecoding", "generative", "generativeart", "rasterize", "3d", "rasterize", "selfportret", "digitalart", "generativedesign"], "extra": {}}
