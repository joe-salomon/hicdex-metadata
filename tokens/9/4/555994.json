It's cool, it brought people together, and it's the season when I first met you. I hope it'll last forever, But before I know it. It's ended. The wind stops, The snow melted. And you're gone.....\n\n[About this project]\nIt's happen when I've found a few unfinished demo tracks that my brother and I made together in 2013. And I don't want these tracks to be kept like that and be forgotten. So, I've decided to mint it here with my pixel art to tell a story.
