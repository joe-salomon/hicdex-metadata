Spaceboy is all of us who went through the loss of ambition to go on when the reason has forsaken our purpose. \n\nSpaceboy - Kintsugi symbolizes the healing process similar to the Japanese art of \"golden repair\" - a process of piecing broken pottery back together by mending the areas of breakage as part of its history rather than hiding the cracks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQHVts5REMmES7MUZTwxyFESLH7YguL37M4vTCiaK6miB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTYxiChePjHWS3Ci7L2WeGfqxMYGfBaTB11EGJGkpQvsN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQHVts5REMmES7MUZTwxyFESLH7YguL37M4vTCiaK6miB", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ZUiXdJgGkHXz4eSSfCDRGZegTceFtJZsn"], "tags": ["music", "animation", "experimental", "heart", "kintsugi", "spaceboy", "zid", "monster", "love"], "extra": {}}
