That childhoods happen about couple decades far before now, but the impacts, remain until now. The fact that i got forbid to go out, hang around with other kids, screw my social life. I have to try hard to do that. I knooww, its a basic things, easy peasy, what a lame, bla bla bla bla bla, but here's the things, i try to adapt. its uncommon things for me, i used to socialize with pencils and papers. with a people, a \"real people\", thats a different things.\n\nPen and paper is a stuff, i understand the purpose they made. But a people ? What is that ? \n\nI think, people is complicated, sometimes i think i understand, but it means that i didn't.
