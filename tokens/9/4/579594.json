I had to do another one, but I wanted to make it ironic this time. A Venn Diagram by definition has more than one circle associated with it. So by using only one, this makes it a contradiction of a Venn Diagram. It's impossible to have a Venn like this as you're not comparing more than one bit of information. When we say \"AND VENN THERE WAS ONE.\", we're playing on this truth and the pun of VENN from the word THEN. The saying, \"...and then there was one.\", is a reference from the (in)famous Agatha Christie story, \"Ten Little Indians\".
