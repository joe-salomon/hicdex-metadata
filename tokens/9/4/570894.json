To be smart you sacrifice your time to learn, to be healthy you sacrifice your desire to eat junk food, even tho as simple as moving an object from here to there you sacrifice your energy to be able to do it. So my point is, everything in this world, every action you have made, it comes with the prices.\n\nBlue Version", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV1D494bkXv5DZnTMesqvvRgmSeXBMvCRb7oopAuAVjh2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNrUm1FsBhwJqkUpWVU8Tevyx5uMG4ufXMsi1Z5e6ywvB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmTxMKM47pfXJb1a7W5D6S9ryzmwQmvBJiqTtZv8HDU2WM", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmV1D494bkXv5DZnTMesqvvRgmSeXBMvCRb7oopAuAVjh2"}], "creators": ["tz1Tseotz12jGuaec5btiegqjZCWWxmVvFyb"], "tags": ["#digital#art#artwork"], "extra": {}}
