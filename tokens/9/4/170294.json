He is loveable and pleasant, but can also be very sneaky and a bit manipulative.\n\nHe is addicted to strawberry bonbons, something which his friend Anne pointed out when he was 18. The problem intensified in 1963. Chang has lost three jobs as a result of his addiction, specifically: dishwasher at burger joint, local activist and movie extra.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSHcNJomZzNwYN76C7dukgWMdMzhrk8qxnhGKZgKXeXf9", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd1UXbLveM5Zp5eH5fUXMMLmtAPQhgmPdJcv4SFQ83w7L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSHcNJomZzNwYN76C7dukgWMdMzhrk8qxnhGKZgKXeXf9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hHrWwmWDbBhyoigpkCDfDTWPHPqwUkcHB"], "tags": ["cartoon", "2d", "cute", "funny", "pink", "strawberry", "candy", "senior", "drawing", "character", "illustration", "grandpa", "collection", "old", "people", "dope", "seniors", "dopeseniors"], "extra": {}}
