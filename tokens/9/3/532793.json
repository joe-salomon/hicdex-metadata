Phew... take it easy. It turned out to be a woman and a lion known as Strength. The woman is a kind and compassionate person, also she handles everything with care. If she appears in front of you, it means she wants to teach you to learn to be a patient, forgiving, and confident person with strong willpower. So, try to face a challenge peacefully, because you have the strength to control your impulses and the animal desires within and you can do that with love.\n\nShe is clad in a white dress (represents her purity of spirit and virtue), sitting upon the lion. There is a lemniscate above her head, represents enlightenment, spiritual powers, and her unlimited potential. That infinity sign same as we see in The Magician card.

Thus, this lion symbolizes the passion and desire that is within it, the power that can be used both constructively and destructively.\n\nStrength \u2021 is the 8th card in the Major Arcana. The number 8 refers to authority and balance.\n\n*This item is available only as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).
