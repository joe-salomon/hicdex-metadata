The skull's resonant frequency is in tune with the electromagnetic field emanated by human beings. The electromagnetic field of the human carrying the Golden Time Cranium would make it self-oscillate in a feedback loop that causes a safe portal-in-time to open.\n\nOther living forms' magnetic fields would not be tuned to the Golden Time Cranium and would not activate it.\n\nThe POWERSKULLZ are part of the POWERVERSE, a reality where humans have achieved their highest potential and live as gods.\n\n_\nGIF - 1080 x 1080 px\n\n_\nThanks to @billellis for the amazing skull model.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR4eq8YJXzqziXAFijTA3tCFmLzHuboQXyZnfBTpRobGr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR4eq8YJXzqziXAFijTA3tCFmLzHuboQXyZnfBTpRobGr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR4eq8YJXzqziXAFijTA3tCFmLzHuboQXyZnfBTpRobGr", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cALi4cQRKtSMCU92nkmtQtZPZGppeHke1"], "tags": ["objkt4objkt", "skull", "cranium", "billellis", "glow", "cyberpunk", "death", "mementomori", ""], "extra": {}}
