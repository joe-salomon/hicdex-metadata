It is a work that I like very much because it represents something very important to me, my favorite clothing brand for some years, POLO RALPH LAUREN. I collect pieces of the brand as if they were yu-gi-oh cards, it's always a constant search, I'm fascinated by all the history behind it and it always inspires me to create works that I keep private, maybe in the future I'll start to publish them here.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNkpyus4e6PVFXz9o9ta7S88t7gpjWwnGBSU2jaFZM6GD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNP5rf53ScDi3mSPDr82atnHhbJhb6pVpd9kCBXWu73B3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNkpyus4e6PVFXz9o9ta7S88t7gpjWwnGBSU2jaFZM6GD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fyWsXPcvWwaLcp8T2AyycSyNd7yHaxNZd"], "tags": ["hen600k", "nfts", "artwork", "art", "graphicdesign", "design", "digital", "photoshop", "nfts", "digitaldraw", "illustrator", "wacom", "edit", "draw", "dibujo", "polo", "poloralphlauren", "lolife", "polosport", "poloralph"], "extra": {}}
