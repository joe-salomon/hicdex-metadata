The concept of the series is to bring more awareness to the disturbing status as well as the amazing migration of Monarch Butterflies. Indeed, the Monarch Butterfly is one of North America\u2019s most phenomenal species. Since the single food source for monarch caterpillars is the milkweed, you are encouraged to plant milkweed as well as nectar-rich flowers for the Monarch Butterflies' survival. You are encouraged to support the wildlife and environmental conservation advocates, nonprofits, and other grassroots organizations that are working to protect Monarch Butterflies as well as promoting awareness about their status.\n\n\n  This image was created with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI).
