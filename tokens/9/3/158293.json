I had to put a stop to this. So I decided to call my friend Cacaco Belly Flop, from a distinguished group of apes, who knew everyone in the metaverse; he would know who could help me. As soon as Belly arrived, I received him with a nice Belly Flop Joint. I know that when we went to smoke the joint, the rats appeared, laser and all, to attack us. I know Belly climbed on the joint, the rat lasers set the pot on fire, and since the window was closed, we all got high. But before he left - and he left me drooling on the living room floor, cuddling with the rats - Belly told me the address of a group of killer cats from the Deep Web, who would solve my problem once and for all.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRyEuFDbHjeSnkHxissRY7WYBSCa5dgRGoKZ1M2WnuWbn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRyEuFDbHjeSnkHxissRY7WYBSCa5dgRGoKZ1M2WnuWbn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRyEuFDbHjeSnkHxissRY7WYBSCa5dgRGoKZ1M2WnuWbn", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZhZnNDbg5XyurR2rPB7eNwZuAf4Jow6XJ"], "tags": ["CryptoDealer", "NFTStory", "DigitalArt", "Literature", "Weed"], "extra": {}}
