Exactly after the 40 artwork, two days ago was my 40 years birthday. Yes this is a new step in my life, I have to choose my next path in 40 as a sacred number. There are stepping stones for high jumps to the man to start big things. And the artwork no.41 is the first stepping stone for my higher jump. I am a real rooster, who has been appearing as a \"indukayam\". I crow loudly but not as strong as a lion or louder than a wolf. Indukayam is myself, who decided to resign from work after 11 years as an employee, graphic designer in the company and decided to raise my Rooster in my art. There is my soul that lives in freedom of will and work there. This is the real of me, like a chicken looking for food that can't be far from its cage, and is dazed if it gets lost. Likewise myself, I also want to be a chicken, sitting while drawing and imagining here, as freely as possible.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPCy8DTJDrm2JvEdxvLonVY6RmEMmdyUG8dhxXhQ3Pbrb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYHtgGsc7oAM5qy4AfZZHJmcRcBB6ToD9y7grbWfut89m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPCy8DTJDrm2JvEdxvLonVY6RmEMmdyUG8dhxXhQ3Pbrb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VnxEQEKZ3D5UdDLjZn5MU5p9S89QfhHE6"], "tags": ["chicken", "philospher", "art", "eat", "rooster", "work", "morning", "food", "resign", "company", "freedom", "artist", "love", "life"], "extra": {}}
