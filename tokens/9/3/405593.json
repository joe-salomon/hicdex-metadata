Each young man represented an element: water, wind, fire, earth. On this journey they were interrupted by a blue deer with a bright countenance: Kauyumari.\nAfter many days of persecution, Kauyumari took pity on them and let them rest. When they awoke, after sleeping for several days, they discovered that the blue deer had taken them far away.\nThey were in the house of the blue deer, in the sacred territory of Wirikuta, where the 4 Wixaricas found, thanks to Kauyumari, the peyote. The 4 young men collected the peyotes (hikuli) and took them to the community. The community ate this sacred food and the sadness, hopelessness, hunger and thirst disappeared. For the Wixarica the peyote became a sacred food.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcjopgCVwST4BWvwboptf8tTsGZCx2TxSP7kjv4yynqmu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU6F3hgWiCs5F17c1cRxof7diF4mfVa9sj7Pc9uiwqNH4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcjopgCVwST4BWvwboptf8tTsGZCx2TxSP7kjv4yynqmu", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iW3xQuuwU8nKQr2gLb98jCdtqaka56vjk"], "tags": ["Peyote", "wixarika", "digitalart", "trippy", "medicine", "sacred", "history", "visualart", "mandala", "psychedelic"], "extra": {}}
