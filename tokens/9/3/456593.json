Sandro, in a clear psychotic break, hijacked a bus in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city.\nThe press put on a media show, attracting a lot of people to the place. The police, very poorly prepared, took the worst decisions at the behest of the governor of the time.\n\nAt the end of this episode, the kidnapper got off the bus and was surprised by a police officer from the BOPE (Rio Special Police).\nThe policeman shot the hostage, the population tried to lynch the kidnapper, and he was killed by asphyxiation inside the police vehicle on his way to the police station.\n\nThe state has once again marked history in blood. With his worst decisions, he killed two black men and a woman, victims of a life-devouring machine.\n\n5696x8188", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPoQs8KZQsSduBGSn6jfEGA7EVLxpHRGFqjHxLfLzvNXp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX4Y1DLrSv5QKFwTin4wWP7ued39t6tpi5nE232epzeZo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPoQs8KZQsSduBGSn6jfEGA7EVLxpHRGFqjHxLfLzvNXp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1deUBZhmRDA7vfxtBot6GWUcLuvYRWx4Hr"], "tags": ["Linestoreflect"], "extra": {}}
