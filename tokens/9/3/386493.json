It can make all the difference in the world. \n\nRelease - clarity and peace of mind will come. \n\nWe are social creatures there to help and support each other. For some people reaching out can be the hardest most courageous thing they can do in their life. Asking for help means being vulnerable, it means that you have to trust who you\u2019ve asked. For some people trusting anyone with who you really are and how you really feel and what you really want is the most impossible thing. Or at least it seems that way. When you\u2019ve been attacked before you learn to protect yourself, to build a mighty wall of armour that will defend you from any future intrusion or attack. Reaching out means letting go of the armour and this is why it is so courageous. It's like walking into battle and accepting your death. Has someone tried to reach out to you? Do you need to reach out? Trust your instincts, you know when your armour no longer serves you, you know that the armour is the battle. Be brave strong and soft whichever side you are on.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW7jHuanLhA81My3woMJ5fpL3VnfL5iJWrqHxrASeXNuM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU4tA6p9ZD73TRpN72DKAse583nS8dPL26TqYaRKFrD5f", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW7jHuanLhA81My3woMJ5fpL3VnfL5iJWrqHxrASeXNuM", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
