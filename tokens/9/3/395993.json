The topic includes interpersonal rejection (or peer rejection), romantic rejection and familial estrangement. A person can be rejected by individuals or an entire group of people. Furthermore, rejection can be either active, by bullying, teasing, or ridiculing, or passive, by ignoring a person, or giving the \"silent treatment\". The experience of being rejected is subjective for the recipient, and it can be perceived when it is not actually present.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaJZh7bc4qdhEvEYLki1C2d6Rdae5snJDhPuKhCX5Ut7u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVZNnA4xKJe6oZmHHEqbzgmjebHetBfmVFK2t666Stuk3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaJZh7bc4qdhEvEYLki1C2d6Rdae5snJDhPuKhCX5Ut7u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aJBLcVBCs65G5oE8KtAW1mgLJGnjHYAfX"], "tags": ["streetphotography", "photography", "streetphoto", "photographer", "disability", "ability", "bnw", "bnwphotography", "socialscience", "sociology", "psychology", "blackandwhite", "blackandwhitephotogrphy", "monochrome", "urban", "urbanart", "wheel", ""], "extra": {}}
