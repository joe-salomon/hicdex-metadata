{"__version": 1, "token_id": 422393, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "XIII Death Tarot Card", "description": "Death is the 13th and most feared cards in the tarot deck, because it is so powerful. Although this card shows death, it actually is the most positive out of all. The death card signals that one major life phase is ending and a new one is starting. You just need to close one door, so the new one will open. Leave the past and focus your energies on the future.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSjeBCR4WWoyLxwePytWonhc8qgtW3hWU62hY85hnKSpy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbnMcAR1wMoXSwff4kAhvr9ss9J9U1ZmzFvcrwGr2oMeg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSjeBCR4WWoyLxwePytWonhc8qgtW3hWU62hY85hnKSpy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dp7MXixMMaXGQB3JqYm25iLLV4fbqesh5"], "tags": ["occult", "skull", "tarot", "cards", "collectibles", "alchemy", "birds", "halloween", "psychic"], "extra": {}}
