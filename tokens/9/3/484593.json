For one, the retail fashion chain was placed under the care of a secretive cabal of fund managers known as the \"Ominous Group.\"  But rather than shore up profits by laying off waves of employees, the Group instead increased funding for \"continuing education,\" mandating that every employee learn Latin and Romanian. They also began providing bonuses to any employee who donated blood and plasma on a weekly basis. For what reason? No one knows. /////\n\nMetarealistic game photography depicting hypercorporate, antisocial, and sometimes liminal virtual environments.\n\nThis photographed scene was created using \"The Life Stage: Virtual House,\" a building design simulator released in 1993 for the 3DO console.\n\nAlthough the game has fallen into obscurity, it was notably ahead of its time for its use of photographic gameplay elements within an immersive 3D virtual space.\n\n// Artwork by Sabato Visconti // www.sabatobox.com // @sabatobox on IG //", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSR8Fs1sztSLvxEHnTHmegKGztpF9CRQmPqrhAthemYyg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSR8Fs1sztSLvxEHnTHmegKGztpF9CRQmPqrhAthemYyg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSR8Fs1sztSLvxEHnTHmegKGztpF9CRQmPqrhAthemYyg", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1U8x9dUtdv4mtLUvaukpMNVi1wvNxr1gy2"], "tags": ["gif", "www", "90s", "dreamcore", "lowpoly", "surreal", "digital", "webcore", "goth", "videogame", "gaming", "fashion", "mall", "aesthetic", "3do"], "extra": {}}
