At its heart is the chaotic, tumultuous Old Quarter, where the narrow streets are roughly arranged by trade. There are many little temples, including Bach Ma, honoring a legendary horse, plus Dong Xuan Market, selling household goods and street food. A pleasant place to travel and explore on foot, this French-colonial city is also known for its exellent cuisine, especially street food, vibrant and lively nightlife, silks and handicrafts, as well as a multi-cultural community that\u2019s comprised of Chinese, French and Russian influences.\n\nHanoi's revolution tells the other side of Hanoi's story. This city is underdeveloping, which results in the abundant number of cranes, unfinished construction sites and messy building arrangement. Hanoi daily life is fast-pace and unpredictable. It may sound unpleasant but I really do enjoy living here and I somewhat love the chaotic nature of it. It's still kinda annoying sometimes, but in the grand scheme of thing, I can't deny the fact that I love Hanoi.\n\nHanoi's revolution, made by puiback using Photoshop and Grease Pencil - Blender.
