{"__version": 1, "token_id": 512493, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Two Level Truchet Pattern Pen Plot #293792", "description": "This is an application of the principle of Multi-Scale Truchet Patterns (Carlson, 2018), which generates multiscale patterns and yields a large variety of forms. This design is based on a noise grid with two levels.\n\nThis is made with Nodebox, a node-based visual language for generative art. All artworks are unique because they are based on a random seed value. This is #293792.\n\nThis is a \u2018plottable artwork\u2019. Which means it can be drawn by a machine: a pen plotter. This design is plotted with a Posca PC-1MR Paint Marker 0.7 Metallic Blue on ClaireFontaine Troph\u00e9e Black 210 grams A4 paper. Color shown here is for illustration purposes.  \n\nI am happy to deliver a physical drawing after purchase (international shipping included). Feel free to DM me via twitter.com/floris_de_jonge or instagram.com/dejongefloris/. Pictures of plotted designs can be found there as well.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXH63PcrRRdmnbvj1pZQ9VyS1dc24CMcyZycsfkKLPAZY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXH63PcrRRdmnbvj1pZQ9VyS1dc24CMcyZycsfkKLPAZY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXH63PcrRRdmnbvj1pZQ9VyS1dc24CMcyZycsfkKLPAZY", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1SHteAqHWkCUKvHGTNScNyuZLw4vd43jse"], "tags": ["Generative", "plot", "penplotter", "svg", "vector", "truchet", "pattern", "geometric", "physical"], "extra": {}}
