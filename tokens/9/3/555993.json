I wrote this poem for him. I truly do love my life with him, but I love our lives together even better. It's kind of a wait a minute, makes you want to go back and read it again to make sure that you're reading that accurately, kind of sentence. It's an acknowledgement of my individual feelings towards my relationship with Teddy and it also speaks to how much I love our collective love even more than that. (I can just hear the art/book critics groaning with apathy; either that or they love it. I can't tell, lol.)
