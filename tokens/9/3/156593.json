{"__version": 1, "token_id": 156593, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Alpha", "description": "Fully transparent Image in FULL HD. According to Wikipedia...\" In a 2D image a color combination is stored for each picture element (pixel). Additional data for each pixel is stored in the alpha channel with a value ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel is fully transparent and does not provide any coverage information; i.e. there is no occlusion at the image pixel window because the geometry did not overlap this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is fully opaque because the geometry completely overlaps the pixel window.\" Hence the image is fully transparent (\u03b1=0) and the Imagebackground is set black it appears black.
