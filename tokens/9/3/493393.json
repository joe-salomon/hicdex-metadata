There had been many ugly incidents, such as the Battle of Orgreave in June, and much flying picketing. The NUM president, Arthur Scargill, was now saying in October that he was prepared to go to jail rather than compromise on his opposition to pit closures.\n\nThe miners\u2019 dispute had overshadowed the Labour Party conference at Blackpool, with delegates launching attack after attack on police conduct in the violence of the flying pickets.\n\nThe Tories were already portraying Labour as a party manacled to Scargill and facing a terminal decline in public esteem.\n\nOn October 4 Tebbit, the Trade and Industry Secretary, addressed a Glasgow rally of West of Scotland Conservatives, at which he portrayed Kinnock as a \u201cfoolish young man dabbling in business he doesn\u2019t understand and hasn\u2019t the depth of character to manage.\n\ncoal.faithgrace.co.uk ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR18E4TG2mqS52wMsaUUxjNKtgMoLcYKrzspHzDectWUu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcNzp1dqevrqLZTF7gi7etBZRvgphz82QGr1WyRi4zd63", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR18E4TG2mqS52wMsaUUxjNKtgMoLcYKrzspHzDectWUu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e3TV8PBSQ2EsZdaZjiEsrmXnfQCL7xrTX"], "tags": ["Kinnock", "Scargill", "miners", "strike"], "extra": {}}
