H=N BLOCK celebrates the H=N Community, allowing multiple users to contribute to a multi-subjective & multi-objective collaborative whole, an open architecture of collaborative objects. These shared blocks are visible as long as a visitor is Here And Now. This ephemeral persistence allows for community design sessions, various user-generated content, curated live events, and variation through participation.\n _______Navigation__________\nMove: [w, a, s, d] [q, e]\nMove up/down: [q, e]\nRotate View: [LeftClickHold + move Mouse in direction]\n _______Place BLOCK__________\nPlaceBLOCK: [LeftMouseClick]\nDeleteBLOCK: [RightMouseButton]\nPlaceBLOCK ProBuilderMode: [1|2|3|4|5|6|7] (to select a specific part of the current Kit of Parts)\nPlaceBLOCK RandomMode: [8] (to enable random part selection mode of the current Kit of Parts)\nUse standard Kit of Parts: [r]\n _______Display Functions__________\nShow BLOCK Owner Names: [n] on/off\nColor Mode ON: [c]\nColor Mode OFF: [v]\n _______Animate Growth Functions__________\nAnimate BLOCK Sequence: [u]\nAnimate BLOCK Sequence Show All: [o]\n _______Unlockable Content Functions__________\nThere is Unlockable Content embedded, check my twitter to learn how to unlock certain Functions & 3D Content.  \n_________________ \nby Alexander Grasser, 2021 @grasser_alex alexandergrasser.com #collaborativeobjects #realtimearchitecture #architecturemachine\n_________________ \nThis is an experimental NFT, that works Here and Now, but as it calls external APIs, there is the chance that it might break in the future.
