The subject matter is based around NftBiker's comment on Twitter that \"Live feed is a nest of spies...\" (https://twitter.com/nftbiker/status/1436642675298652160?s=21)\n\nDue to Hicdex instability, the gating code was removed and the piece is now available to all as if they were the owner. Previously, only owners would be allowed to click the door and view the gallery.\n\nNow, everybody can visit the Den of Spies! \n\nInstructions:\n\nPressing the SPACE BAR returns you to the door.\n\nTap/click to open the door. \n\nOnce you are viewing the spies, double-click/tap to refresh the view and generate new spies. On mobile, tap once to attract attention to a new location.\n\nThe eyes track the mouse position.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQuaAhLukWR9XGoFPacr8DvrYoyLKXokjS87Hyvtqbm39", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNeEcDbkLxxXeUjPSjQ4bRdaPBs5gte6r7r4e67CoEAvc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQuaAhLukWR9XGoFPacr8DvrYoyLKXokjS87Hyvtqbm39", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1LH1yn4tKVmNNeSzwoRT6zZ375K9yi1NoR"], "tags": ["experimental", "p5js", "interactive", "generative", "colorful", "spies", "fun", "eyeballs"], "extra": {}}
