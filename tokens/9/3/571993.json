They are also used in other artistic contexts such as knockers and ceramics. Pairs of guardian lion statues are still a common and symbolic element at entrances to restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and other structures, with one on each side of the entrance in China and other places around the world where Chinese immigrated and settled, especially in local Chinatowns.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXx59hw3VqZCmYv5r2UXDHS8kZDjrHKFUtTywJRovv8QT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP5Y8mya5i1pSghg8S9SVu4ZzroC1nMNZ8Cbnc6AkdwHv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXx59hw3VqZCmYv5r2UXDHS8kZDjrHKFUtTywJRovv8QT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1T25gPKf4K9YtRtKzsuaxH94u4Jy7iuvcQ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "digitaldrawing", "digitalillustration", "tattoosketch", "neotraditional"], "extra": {}}
