In another life I could have seen myself as an anatomical illustrator. Growing up my parents had an entire catalog of Encyclopedia Britannica and there was 1 volume that had these acetate overlaid illustrations of the human body where each layer was a different integral system. I loved it. Now I work with different types of bones and sinew. Twitter and IG: Nikejerk.
