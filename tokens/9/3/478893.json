A word that brings back one of humanity's most heinous acts.\n\nDuring the Early Modern period, there was once a witch-hunt. Witches were people who were \"different\" from the majority of society and were accused of being the cause of strange happenings. Witches were believed to have made a contract with Satan in exchange for superhuman abilities. Those accused of witchcraft were faced with a lot of inhumane tortures until they confessed to being witches, and the ruthless execution followed.\n\nNo one wants this despicable history to repeat itself, but have the witch-hunts truly disappeared from this world? No, I believe that witch-hunting still exists nowadays, although in a different form.\n\nThis painting was created to remind people of this terrible history. People used to kill each other mercilessly simply because of their beliefs. Nowadays, we still harass each other in the same way that our ancestors used to hunt witches. I understand that it is impossible to completely eradicate immoral behavior from the world, but having fewer of them is enough to make our society better.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWqBG4DtQ7iPgGgSrwTbUiDnHYhZpQCqdg4ypnmgWePhD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVW59p1inDVpSzYhRGnSusbvmjEJ4kbwTixZSY6k7w5PC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWqBG4DtQ7iPgGgSrwTbUiDnHYhZpQCqdg4ypnmgWePhD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PPf3GCwRHbxczXi8wmMuV39yuAsi1LAdq"], "tags": ["HenloweenTH", "HENHalloween", "art", "artwork", "illustration", "nftart", "anime", "animenft", "manga", "witch", "witchhunt", "halloween"], "extra": {}}
