That translated into making my own mixtapes for friends and family.  The art of the mixtape is a lost art and I wanted to create something that paid respect to an artform that meant so much to me.  \n\nCOLLECTORS ***Please DM proof of purchase on twitter and I will share the actual mixtape playlist I put together on applemusic.  I guarantee you either make out with someone you are attracted to or laugh until you throw up from the musical selections.  Either way its gonna be a good time!
