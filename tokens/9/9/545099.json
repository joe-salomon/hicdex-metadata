They focus on praising and worshiping God for who he is and what he does, and they spend most of their time directly in God's presence in heaven.\n\nThe word \"seraphim\" is derived from the Hebrew word saraph, which means \"to burn.\" Seraphim angels burn with passion for God that ignites the fiery love that emanates from them. The Bible and Torah describe love as \"a blazing fire, like a mighty flame\" (Song of Solomon 8:6). As the seraphim absorb God's pure and radiant love while spending time in God's presence, completely enveloped by the powerful light of love.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXLJg9b3TjVFV1jWbrGjiTCnipoTDoNk1SeydEUG2iXgA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUa2diEvsTvLz1WzBhfNe3kGxQRWGmruJUqmiiMiDkyJF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXLJg9b3TjVFV1jWbrGjiTCnipoTDoNk1SeydEUG2iXgA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Aa4JRqVjtrx71zCbuJFYWTKM5y3Eg31X2"], "tags": ["art", "generative", "abstract", "tezos", "painting", "psychidelic", "draw", "drawing", ""], "extra": {}}
