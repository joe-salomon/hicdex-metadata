In this one we can see 5 sculptures that represent the artist\u2019s family and some other details like a Romanian flag and some personal photos and works on the wall. With minimal interventions on the walls of the space, he embraced that old factory underground and added sculptures, paintings and personal objects in there transforming it into something totally different, a time capsule in constant deterioration by the elements. My approach at the time was to use photogrammetry as a medium that will store the underground and let the user explore it as it was in that phase. This is the second of 4 special editions. 1/1, part of the 100 scans series, Timisoara, Romania 2018.
