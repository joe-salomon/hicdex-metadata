His tactical, strategic, abilities are unrivalled \u2013 even within the collective of the Generatives. \n\nAnd he is well known for sheer brutality \u2013 there is nothing of the stealthy lines that the the assassin Morrigu deploys; with his war-dog Taran Disruptive, he quickly assesses the situation before him and will strategically brutalise his way to victory.\n\nHis most impressive feat to date was to force the ground to open just as a legion of Generatives rushed to battle; more than half of them were lost to unknown depths before those rushing from behind realised what had happened.\n\nThis, though, was already too late for the remaining warriors as Belatucad and his maidens of death, the Cernus, had already circled and begun to liquidise them even as the last of them fell, doomed to hell.\n\nPNG 4800 x 4800 || December 13th 2021 || Dark Art digital painting \u2013 expanding the Gormenghast origin universe\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme7JawXDQtKzTYZ4yF5cYSh8nbKHC2Jo7mFbiCPbnukaQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUXG7TBJEmBDJj7dqVBSzLafZ9iRCzBEBFa5zCFdhQ5fF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSAJVfasPiznkd7xN2VYH44cpW8q4hSExb6qPtaMHLXZY", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme7JawXDQtKzTYZ4yF5cYSh8nbKHC2Jo7mFbiCPbnukaQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NWtHHck4dxpwCSGVrboat83R9STyLfmfA"], "tags": ["darkartstudio", "gormenghast", "gothicart", "digitalpainting", "metaverse", "darkart", "nftart", "horror", "gothic", "evil", "stevemunro"], "extra": {}}
