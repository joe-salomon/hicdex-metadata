I've changed her little monster character that cosplay to Tani (A Thai traditional ghost which appears as a young woman that haunts wild banana trees known generically as lady of the wood.) to an abstract art. The concept is talking about the little monster that want to explore the world. This painting has 2 parts that mean Tani is going to explore her another part in the new world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbPVTVpBYXWXUk3QpuhF8Q7yrN3xi341w3o5TBYZTesqM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXSWsa2sayBWquPGAGEcbSzd3VmA14qd7CXX62g5bYArZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbPVTVpBYXWXUk3QpuhF8Q7yrN3xi341w3o5TBYZTesqM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UyQS8mdJ8abNodDjV7bH7kDHJgKJvi5AS"], "tags": ["abstract", "abstractart"], "extra": {}}
