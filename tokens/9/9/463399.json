But somewhere deep down inside I understood that everything is moving towards this format and is developing very logically. Technology does not stand still and artistic culture is quite actively adapting to new formats. Until recently, digital art did not go beyond screens. Now we are seeing more and more new performances every year. And this is cool. \n\nUntil recently we had to think about how to implement digitals, but now there are areas where such art can be bought. In digital form. And it's very cool!  Maybe not everyone understands what it is, how it works, who needs it, etc. But now is the time to take the bull by the horns and open new doors!\n\nI believe in nft! The main thing is to do and create with all your heart!\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfYgg86z5bPtkQ1Wi3SFkvY3KawbVESvs8YxAvs7cgkTE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUPfZSH9KomxWZ8waRPLMqZWN9poqwqGFBsp4Ltifc32b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfYgg86z5bPtkQ1Wi3SFkvY3KawbVESvs8YxAvs7cgkTE", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cgT6gJt2YBBP4R9vnSYBaxre8E3PNk6wn"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
