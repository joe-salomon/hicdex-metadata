The world's first artificial satellite was about the size of a beach ball (58 cm.or 22.8 inches in diameter), weighed only 83.6 kg. or 183.9 pounds, and took about 98 minutes to orbit Earth on its elliptical path. That launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments. While the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the space age and the U.S.-U.S.S.R space race.\n\n\u0421\u043f\u0443\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a-1 (SPUTNIK 1) is the 1st issue of my interactive Solaristics series.
