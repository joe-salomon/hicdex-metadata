Clearly, just add a couple of letters and add 1. In this case, we have 1 WHITE LIE that becomes 2 WHITE LINES. What do these lines of text mean or intimate? For one we can push the narrative of someone lying about doing lines of cocaine. Did you read it that way? I tried add an extra line below the 2 WHITE LINES, that would have said, 3 WHITE LINERS, but it didn't look right and or good. It looks better as a duet of lines. Proof that this is in the 'just because you can doesn't mean you should' category. This was an exploration of minimalistic intervention with numbers and words.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXK6Kv9KmRPEMCwm1Wqbg4AZPLRVFDNFuZzUftyiTVzjU", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb1ex2AFdSburo3jqiFshVCPoQgNvcCZq6rnakPK2aZo6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXK6Kv9KmRPEMCwm1Wqbg4AZPLRVFDNFuZzUftyiTVzjU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
