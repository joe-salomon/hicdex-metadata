In doing so, the summoner is invisible from the creatures that lurk within the shadows. The invisibility wears off when the summoner is cast amongst the daylight or if there is nothing amongst the darkness around you. They are able to see beyond just the mortal world, but spirit and dark realms as well.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbKtgTa1batN8Wja1LNCb1hNZd8xPRrZcBt2xXFhx9RMT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTRSw2ieJXgsBsZj8Ayjg6oSjD9mhNmbwppTUcHyN6rQv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmcrD8fJNqvQ4kZeBq35Us1pfpqNyoCmwFMrTNMWaAPdQB", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbKtgTa1batN8Wja1LNCb1hNZd8xPRrZcBt2xXFhx9RMT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YPLmM3SjL2LjeLxbFPhpraWwGcTiijvhv"], "tags": ["digital"], "extra": {}}
