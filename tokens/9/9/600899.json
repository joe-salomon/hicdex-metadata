Madeline is another good friend of mine and this one was made for her. She's from Wellfleet where there are no rules a lot of the time, and as she once told me \"there are no laws in these wild lands\". Yet, adjacent to (and even inside of), there were tourists, vacationers, and people who did not belong. I visited her often in the Winter when beach-goers empty out, and the strange beach landscapes spotted with kettleponds and gnarled juniper trees and long grasses and small birds are covered in a soft snow. This was an ode to her ability to keep calm in a storm, while always knowing how to have fun. I hope you carry this piece and feel that sentiment coursing through you", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWVw7W6wqug8weBWiaqcsSwqKHzXbKkLDhwCExt4nTyjL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeS7fK5g6KYS4NL7xER548zYZzpQkWGMb4nsoLZqyLh18", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWVw7W6wqug8weBWiaqcsSwqKHzXbKkLDhwCExt4nTyjL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VmZyzx1mMvhNtP7yWVcGr2Q5qJ3ghqeZB"], "tags": ["beach", "collage", "tourist", "NFT", "digitalcollage", "handmade", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
