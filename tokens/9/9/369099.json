I continued, \u201cOr you can sell it or drop it if it\u2019s unbearably heavy for you.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled at me again. In his face, in his wry grin I saw mockery, and I wasn\u2019t me and I didn\u2019t like what I saw, and I said, \u201cWhy are you smiling, old fool? It\u2019s you, not me who is carrying this silver box. You told me it\u2019s heavy, but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s as light as a feather, and it\u2019s as fragile as a butterfly, and I can smash your silver box with my hand, and throw it away.\u201d\n\nI grow angrier with my every word and his every grin. I felt the burning in my limbs. I fell on my knees and then on my side. I saw how my hands were shaking but I still carried the silver box. The man bent his knees, reached out and unclenched my fist where his burden had found a room. When he took the box, it wasn\u2019t as small as a matchbox, it was as large as before.\n\nThrough crying, I asked, \u201cWhy are you caring this heavy box?\u201d And he replied, \u201cOne day when you find your destiny you will understand. You will want to throw it out, to sell it or to pass it on to someone else, but it will be yours. Because only when you obey and accept, you become a man with the destiny.\u201d\n\nNow, when I\u2019m finally me, floating among the stars, dreaming about Earth, I carry my unbearable burden, my own silver box.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdY6VpjGsWS9PHDCP2s6jBQobPF1XR193g4cGEdvMwyiC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdY6VpjGsWS9PHDCP2s6jBQobPF1XR193g4cGEdvMwyiC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdY6VpjGsWS9PHDCP2s6jBQobPF1XR193g4cGEdvMwyiC", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1boBFSnCFKEZ4HynCdmDiiNJAvJj5iH7e5"], "tags": ["cryptoliterature", "literature", "fiction", "scifi", "abstract", "transhumanism", "bayfragile", "anemonesdiaries"], "extra": {}}
