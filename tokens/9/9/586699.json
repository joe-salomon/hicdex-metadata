Perseus was a demigod, son of the Olympian god Zeus and the mortal woman Danae. Perseus sought to kill Medusa, the only mortal of the three monstrous sisters. Instead of hair, Medusa had living venomous snakes on her head and anyone that would look at her eyes would immediately turn into stone. With the help and the wisdom of goddess Athena, Perseus approached the monster by looking through the reflection of a shield and cut off her head.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQR8N3SvXo8VSHWeaUitQT7pUXXHX5Au7CAdtxCJAnjS1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSXFjEaPEvVW49q9EPAGuRPqDRCbyqurYGREYwTLSrEcQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQR8N3SvXo8VSHWeaUitQT7pUXXHX5Au7CAdtxCJAnjS1", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LYTtevoCfmmbWn8vGagPJuoNGLawFNeUm"], "tags": ["mythology", "indonesianartist", "artwork", "greek", "statue", "artist", "collages", "nftindonesia", "olympus", "digitalimaging", "ihzmqf", "collage", "surrealism", ""], "extra": {}}
