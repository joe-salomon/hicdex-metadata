So, this project aims to create a mask for every day that can be enjoyed and worn with pride. \nA Mask For Everyday is an idea that begun as a form of mild protest.  I took inspiration from the stories of the Uyghur women who are forced to hide their true identity every day.  Since the project\u2019s inception, the masks have grown to represent how we all wear our own masks from time to time.  \nFractal artwork is used as the imagery for each mask, and each item is chosen to convey an emotion.  My goal with each mask is to use the human silhouette together with colourful fractal artwork to convey a range of emotions.
