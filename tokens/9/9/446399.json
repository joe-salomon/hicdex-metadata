I repeat the exercise in my studio until two rolls of film are full. It becomes more difficult each time; my body becomes stiffer and more alert, as I become more fearful. Usually, when we practice, we improve. It is the opposite when it comes to the pursuit of failure.\nCan we gain routine in failing?\n\nMedium: contact sheet, performative photography on 35mm black-and-white film\nYear: 2012\nBody of Work: Falling Portraits \u2013 Trials in Empty Room", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmduThSuufTiVmteCu8aHafcqJ3BBwEak1Z5HBTmZVt8BY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV8ifuK876xawVZVtNPCCN7oikyD9jYxCmU3YKM4ZpRZv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmduThSuufTiVmteCu8aHafcqJ3BBwEak1Z5HBTmZVt8BY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dPNtwh5of9KCvPBSda27mQspQeW4mWKBm"], "tags": ["performance", "analog", "photography", "black-and-white"], "extra": {}}
