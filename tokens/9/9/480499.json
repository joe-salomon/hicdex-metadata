Call forth for him, to bring an end to humanity, and claim the earth for him and for the old ones who roamed the world in forgotten eons. Welcome, mighty Cthulhu, the one who he rises from the deathless slumber in the lost city of R'lyeh. Welcome him in insanity and primal horror, welcome with the last bit of your crumbling mind. What is the price of the mundane, mediocre life in face of being able to see the true, horrible, maddening nature of reality in his form, even for a few moments? Embrace madness.
