As a biologist, I was drawn to the output as a representation of limpets on wet rock. In close up view, the varied texturing is lovely as well.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWowVz3MnsdmfPZGF9SDzidvYv53wvhqZPP1wctBMmsd2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPr91FxUTFWFxvdp9SWEXAR2fcysbSn45Ca4jQySouJVD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWowVz3MnsdmfPZGF9SDzidvYv53wvhqZPP1wctBMmsd2", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hvabzvmJKQMtArYJANBGj55RFJZayNoUh"], "tags": ["p5js", "monochrome", "3D", "generative", "generativeart"], "extra": {}}
