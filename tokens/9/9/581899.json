He got stomped on by a mech in a tournament fight and life has never been the same since.  He is very handy as a mechanic now though- his bite strength gives him almost an extra hand when he is at work. He also still loves to dance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaE9MTsEVJQm22gywSX7P2aQ2nakXzmjo92P6qUBZS2zQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVWgWNP8K9QrxMHqT2Db7Z1p39PkagmNsW17jn5YQLLwg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaE9MTsEVJQm22gywSX7P2aQ2nakXzmjo92P6qUBZS2zQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["Somethinginyourteeth", "Vessels"], "extra": {}}
