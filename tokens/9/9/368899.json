Her long fingers end with red nails. She hands me a glistering glass, and I drink all at once.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it all about?\u201d I point at the tattoo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about sweet mango sauce, tiger. It\u2019s all about love,\u201d she answers.\n\nIs she looking for the best companion of boozers in a bar or she has a crush on me? Her sharp fingers end red. She has red fingertips.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d she asks. She\u2019s melting, becoming an invisible ghost.\n\n\u201cMore whiskey, less cola,\u201d I say. \u201cMore Ireland,\u201d I add.\n\nShe gives me a smile. She has a tattoo of a yellow hummingbird on her forearm. Long fingers. Red nail polish on sharp nails. She\u2019s mixing me a cocktail. After a pause, she blinks. The electric offspring in a form of a girl disappears, moving to another guy at the counter.\n\nI feel like reality is playing against me. I\u2019m a larva in a human cocoon. The firmament clothed me in a tight leather suit, pumping the energy through the top of my head, it\u2019s consuming me, showering with radiant gifts that are not important.\n\n\u201cWant another one, tiger?\u201d it says. It has a form of a girl with a hummingbird tattoo, big mouth, red lipstick, far beyond the lip contour, long fingers holding a glass.\n\nThe simple question requires significant effort.\n\n\u201cI do not talk to other people much,\u201d I say. \u201cShow me a girl with a red lipstick and a yellow tattoo, the girl you\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nIt shows me a green jungle in the middle of a day. The air is wet and warm. A hummingbird froze in front of a ripe mango fruit. A naked girl with a gold hair is sitting on the roots of a tree and looking at me. The colors start burning my retina, and I ask to dim the lights.\n\n\u201cLooks like it\u2019s too hard for you, tiger,\u201d it says, showing empathy. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep quiet.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt nods to me with a smile. A power supply wired to the colorful neon tubes pushes electricity under barely audible music. Red and yellow reflections in the mirror. Smooth ice cubes bang on the heavy bottom of a glass. The bottle of whiskey rotates, making a turn in its palm. The fingers hold the metal tip tightly. It puts a fresh napkin on a black polished countertop before lending me a drink. Our knowledge and our pain are not that important when sweet mango juice continues to ooze. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this story about?\u201d I ask. I still want to know the story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a tiger.\u201d\n\nIt shows me a naked girl, and then a tiger that jumps.\n\nIt\u2019s so much pain in a human flesh. So much pain I can barely handle it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaia8dCLzDX3r1B2BLjVNhLbGA2iP5K39NUCVKeMYsCQU", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmaia8dCLzDX3r1B2BLjVNhLbGA2iP5K39NUCVKeMYsCQU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaia8dCLzDX3r1B2BLjVNhLbGA2iP5K39NUCVKeMYsCQU", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1boBFSnCFKEZ4HynCdmDiiNJAvJj5iH7e5"], "tags": ["cryptoliterature", "literature", "fiction", "scifi", "abstract", "transhumanism", "bayfragile", "anemonesdiaries"], "extra": {}}
