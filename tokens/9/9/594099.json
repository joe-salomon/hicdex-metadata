{"__version": 1, "token_id": 594099, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Arthenos!, The Producer", "description": "- [ ] A special gift for Dani, who loves both music & pixel art (among other important stuff). In this particular artwork, we can see an animal called \"Chig\u00fcirica\", which is the character he used for his genesis song for a collective drop. Since I haven't met Dani's face, I decided to use the \"Chig\u00fcirica\" in order to illustrate Dani, who is producing music in a \"pixeled-studio\". I made this idea because, of what I've seen, Dani has a dream of becoming a producer \"little, by little\", as he said.
