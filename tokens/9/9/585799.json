As a huge fan of Alien\nmovies, I've always thought about creating my version of one and decided to create an homage to the sequence in 2018. Rather than imitating his work, I described my feeling\nwhen I saw the alien move. especially I put an effort into the contrast between Natural and Artificial that are like the origin of his ideas.
