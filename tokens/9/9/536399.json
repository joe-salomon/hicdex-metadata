THEY HAD DIFFICULTY IN LEARNING HOW TO MINT A RAREPEPE SO THEY HAD TO GO TO ETHEREUM AND COME UP WITH A TERM CALLED 'NFT,' WHICH TO ME SOUNDED LIKE THE TERM EDM AFTER ELECTRONIC MUSIC EXISTED FOR DECADES BEFORE THAT. ANYHOW, HERE WE HAVE ENS NAME WIRED.ETH  WHICH THEY COULD'VE USED FOR THEIR EXISTENCE ON THIS NETWORK.  INSTEAD I'M CHOOSING TO BURN THEIR NAME AND SEND IT TO THE ETHEREUM BURN ADDRESS.  THE ENS CONTRACT LASTS FOR 100 YEARS, THANKS TO GIANNIS SOURDIS FOR REMINDING ME BEFORE I TORCHED IT.  ALSO THANKS TO ARTHUR BROWN FOR WRITING ONE OF THE MOST BITCHIN' SONGS OF THE 60S. UNTIL NEXT TIME WONDERFUL CRYPTOART FRIENDS! CIAO AND MUAH!
