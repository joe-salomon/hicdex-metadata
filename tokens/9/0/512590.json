Autobiographical abstraction.\n\nBINARY pieces obey a set of rules in that they must be constructed using only 2 x white blocks on a black canvas. With these constraints, each canvas is an abstract representation of an autobiographical tale.\n\nI LOVE YOU, TOO\n--------\nOur conversation was interrupted by a fire alarm that emptied the entire hotel onto the street.\nA chorus of strangers, dressed for the privacy of midnight,\nnow thrust into the fairground of a hundred pubs at closing time. \nI wanted to hold her, of course, but instead, we stood solemnly side by side, our hands crisscrossed as our eyes darted from one group of unsteady drunks to the next. Never meeting.\nShe hadn't said anything since the siren broke her pause and she held that silence now. \nThe same for me. \nThe next words would not be spoken here. \nNor outside. \nOr on the stairs. \nNot even as we re-entered room 240 and I closed the door on the world beyond.\nBut when the lights went off, when I could no longer make out her face - only search for her shape, searching for mine in the dark - her throat finally cleared and her answer came to me as if from every dimension at once.\n'I love you, too...'\nShe said.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmerTLFBhPCPfpGxdCGZNrfxLVxRisE7eVajgURAcMtU6K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZw3B1AurqzWBEa5Dnn2FH9pbaJsjd2CjJrAA4yVRn6zx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmerTLFBhPCPfpGxdCGZNrfxLVxRisE7eVajgURAcMtU6K", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WqiSCF73e2YK85VL2EXrgL5oti3AkJEKf"], "tags": ["abstract", "abstractart", "abstractminimalism", "experimental", "poetry", "literary", "binary", "expressionism", "reductionism"], "extra": {}}
