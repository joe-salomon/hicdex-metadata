{"__version": 1, "token_id": 623590, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Launch from Earth", "description": "The sound for Launch from Earth is culled from a series of compositions Andrew Deutsch made using ocean waves as a trigger for a tone digital generator. These recordings were called \u201cocean drones\u201d and/or \u201cimage drones\u201d. This recording is related to, but not included in the out of print and now deleted CD The Sun published by and/or recordings. The changes one can make using the Launch from Earth playback speed are very close to the pitch shifting method Andrew used to produce the \u201cocean drone\u201d pieces.\n\nInteractive visuals was built by Eric Souther. The album is developed in Web.gl, it may take a moment to load and sound to start. You can use XY touch or mouse to move around the sun and pinch/scroll wheel for scaling the sun.
