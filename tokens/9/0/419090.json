It may be a form of mild dissociation; examples of scenarios that suggest compartmentalization include acting in a way that logically defies one's own moral code, or dividing one's unpleasant work duties from one's desires to relax. Its purpose is to avoid cognitive dissonance, or the mental discomfort and anxiety caused by a person having conflicting values, cognitions, emotions, beliefs, etc. within themselves.\n\nCompartmentalization allows these conflicting ideas to co-exist by inhibiting direct or explicit acknowledgment and interaction between separate compartmentalized self-states.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Sumapano", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSKyis2rQHcZLmGXzvcRrU3F3529HVwatsJPc7TA3Hrmp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQYjpbFMZK9uy2qV6ezzsZCdQnzAqZ5fZK66e9B5w64fC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSKyis2rQHcZLmGXzvcRrU3F3529HVwatsJPc7TA3Hrmp", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1KkgvwAE6YAk3Vv8LqzBPg4eUL9aKUse3s"], "tags": ["3d", "animation", "psychology"], "extra": {}}
