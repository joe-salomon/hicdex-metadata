They are most probably accidental residue products while forming the inner core of the moon. There are only 256 Moon Corals in existence and each one has an ID imprinted on its body cell. It is believed that this is the unique instruction seed from which the Moon Coral has been formed.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUBuqm8uSUs4KkJUjCDNYwWQfxSM4Y7YpBCT5RCD7MDuX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRASy6NgPeiqUvhXzEnD9rrLzh3GJaqpLRWrYxxpNuftn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUBuqm8uSUs4KkJUjCDNYwWQfxSM4Y7YpBCT5RCD7MDuX", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1aPu5AYFPTBbtQnCd6NCGHuhj54Ee5xQvz"], "tags": ["mooncorals", "mooncoral", "moon", "coral", "generative", "procedural", "vector", "svg", "gradient", "colorful", "geometric", "shine", "collection", "256", "highresolution"], "extra": {}}
