A frail figure starving and nearly feral; Her face seemed disfigured over years of fighting and survival. To compensate for her size, the Smiling Shinigami outfitted her with Selket's Kiss, a unique Bio-Mech Augment stemming from #13's Shoulder Blades. Selket's Kiss contains an ever potent paralysis poison within the left Stinger, and a Neurotoxin capable of sending foes into a Frenzy in the right dosages. #13 doesn't seem to age, remaining in Combat Ready state long after the Founder had passed, retaining her Rank along the way.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV4gDHrms5oPLsqL8vg2yKyPN7iFu7okAgbeaz67reipm", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb5KHU1aLbYQqEwNrdvrcERBNWJvhqfZuSoTzZ83swA3Q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV4gDHrms5oPLsqL8vg2yKyPN7iFu7okAgbeaz67reipm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WFJ6SrYJTQBMD2Ge248EEntKZH1LtZYZQ"], "tags": ["jpeg", "catarax", "illustration", "darkart", "mementomauri", "shinigami", "2d"], "extra": {}}
