{"__version": 1, "token_id": 585490, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MAYBE THE DARK IS FROM YOUR EYES", "description": "MAYBE THE DARK IS FROM YOUR EYES, draws a direct correlation to the Grateful Dead song, \"Shakedown Street\", more commonly referred to as a 'disco dead' song. I wouldn't call myself a huge Grateful Dead fan per se, but I do enjoy the musicality of their jams. On this particular track, I was mesmerized by the line, \"maybe the dark is from your eyes.\" There was something primal about this lyric and intrinsically human about it. When we see each other, we see forms of matter, but within that matter lies a consciousness just like yours; alive and seemingly autonomous. We have the ability to love or hate, build or destroy, empathy or apathy, etc. Maybe, the dark is from your eyes, but maybe the dark is from OUR eyes, painting everyone else to be the darkness. We project a lot of emotions onto other people. We hardly know ourselves, I mean really know ourselves, beyond the ego-driven narrative that we tell ourselves everyday. Is the dark in their eyes or is it in ours? I'd say both. We all have the capacity to be good or evil; sometimes the dark side is tempting; they have cookies.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX9yf34S3eu8bnEh9Wh8wCpPPjfiEQd8fgwVUCCfWgvkY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSLLnqUShfLjm25kuqR9TTuJUk5HMWduB4TYZCpTNSfkY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX9yf34S3eu8bnEh9Wh8wCpPPjfiEQd8fgwVUCCfWgvkY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
