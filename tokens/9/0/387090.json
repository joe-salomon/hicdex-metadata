I decided I'd get some art prep done while I did so, so I brought a watercolor pad, and some preloaded watercolor brush pens. Iodine in one hand, passing brushes back and forth to my Caretaker and painting in the other, we got 2 minimalist pages done.\n   When I got home I hit a page with water, left one dry, and had AI merge them together, then some Photoshop from there. The result melted away the emotional thorns tearing at my throat the entire day, and I'm again reminded of why I do this: it doesn't matter how disadvantaged I am in this community, this art's my breath and blood - what remains when I'm remains - of course profits matter, this is my career and I'm 40% below the fucking poverty line, but profit doesn't mean shit if pain and stress pushes me over the edge to my grave.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmazso11UFdzWVmQR3gspqTypLhgo9vRHRkf8YFB8vJ7L2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWzffo8TD639Mp5ahTKVrJWQ3P4rR8d1TWaBhEDj635js", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmazso11UFdzWVmQR3gspqTypLhgo9vRHRkf8YFB8vJ7L2", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WSB79B4pMAqzsfhqox2FzCRkf15ybZ4GD"], "tags": ["watercolor", "mixedmedia", "peace", "beach", "tropical"], "extra": {}}
