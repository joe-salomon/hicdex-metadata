{"__version": 1, "token_id": 569990, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Right Ventricle", "description": "Within the human body, the right ventricle pumps oxygen-deprived blood cells through the pulmonary valve and into the lungs in order to maintain a healthy and stable body. With this idea in mind, Right Ventricle explores the notion that each individual\u2019s perceptions of moments are based entirely on their own experiences, and thus any understanding of the world is entirely unique to the individual. Through the use of a custom-designed program, the two sphere-like objects or \u201cblobs\u201d intertwine and dance with one another, creating abstract forms. With the overlay of a mother on all forms within the video as well as constant feedback being generated, each moment becomes dictated by the previous, creating a work that is formed from its own experiences, much like human beings. Additionally, the slow ticking of a heart monitor can be heard in the distant background alongside the occasional choir songs, further developing the sense of life and understanding that is created through the experimentation with the program. Overall,  the piece explores the life and development of the blobs as they grow based upon both the artist\u2019s interaction with the program and MIDI as well as their own feedback generation within the digital space.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZPumVdHsGf9nw86tucrEkLFxQK9J83GN2N5K1WgcakUF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcmjxUe2M9Hjc2U35dJHvUdk4DKzzTNQ3dv11hEvLSV4E", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZPumVdHsGf9nw86tucrEkLFxQK9J83GN2N5K1WgcakUF", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YsE5u9EF6sYW4Tq5dwzhJCv2oT6bTCQpE"], "tags": ["video", "expirimentalvideo", "videoart", "realtime"], "extra": {}}
