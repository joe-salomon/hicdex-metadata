An attitude that overpowered him and turned him into a massive geophysical force, giving him the illusive right to colonize and to terrorize it. The main concern of this project, is set on to explore the extinction manners of various species, that is, thoroughly, a consequence of human-interference with its natural environment. \u200e The Covid-19 epidemic, and its threats against human life, made us conclude a consensual sequel; that highlights the necessity of Human and Nature (or vice versa) interdependence, discussing that one is inseparable to the other. My goal by compiling this work is, in fact, creating an awareness to construct for reaching the better concept and reality. For inhabitable world and livable for every living being.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNxgLvJftec3esFhf3AzSKKNyUPPkdnaShwoF7eXzex48", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNxgLvJftec3esFhf3AzSKKNyUPPkdnaShwoF7eXzex48", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNxgLvJftec3esFhf3AzSKKNyUPPkdnaShwoF7eXzex48", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ZddzDfjoeH5oZDcspCi38txGTddCu1iLU"], "tags": ["digitalart", "painting", "rhino", "animal", "blue"], "extra": {}}
