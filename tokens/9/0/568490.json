{"__version": 1, "token_id": 568490, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "ODE TO SINEAD O'CONNOR", "description": "I adore recording artist, Sinead O'Connor with all being. Ever since I was young I've always admired her bravery in music, against the Catholic Church, in her personal life, and much more. She's been through so much in life; the good and the bad. But, one of the things I noticed as a youth was that if you added a K and an H to her name it spells out skinhead. What makes this even more interesting was that for much of her career, she had a crew cut (close to being shaved completely off). This part needs to be emphasized...obviously, Sinead is NOT a skinhead (a person who associates with a group that commits hooliganism or street violence or that holds white supremacist or anti-immigrant views.) I love you Sinead and I wish you continued success, mental wellness, and I truly hope you find lasting love, you deserve it! You're an amazing human and your journey goes on.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTdpcaC8xDF4vGSnV8s3Mk2naxrVaMS9DkQTwJ3nQY6xx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY8TfvyfW5zNcUbGM4uaCqruR6j6dzBQMXMiSJ5knqWNk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTdpcaC8xDF4vGSnV8s3Mk2naxrVaMS9DkQTwJ3nQY6xx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
