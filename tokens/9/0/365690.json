These organisations are commonly referred to as\u00a0compression algorithms. The choice of an image compression depends on its foreseen\u00a0mode\u00a0and\u00a0place\u00a0of usage: for instance, is the file meant to be printed or redistributed digitally, what kind of accuracy will be necessary and what software or hardware will render the image?\nIn A Vernacular of File Formats, I subsequently compressed the source image via different compression languages and subsequently implementing a same (or similar) error into each file, to let the otherwise invisible compression language presents itself onto the surface of the image.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbvkAs3jjB8ukzr22ohXXcGWTqznpaaYioEJ86iGfYs5E", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeSBrZnWowDDbXNTfUk2tt9jbFfXhbmNsNijb8YkDVrQA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbvkAs3jjB8ukzr22ohXXcGWTqznpaaYioEJ86iGfYs5E", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz2UMmSdhQjLYCbZrRCdWgXey1FahcGVzR3W"], "tags": ["glitch", "glitchart", "glitchstudies", "iRD", "Compression", "compressiondesign", "artifact", "PDF", "artPDF", "FileFormat", ""], "extra": {}}
