It is my first exploration into painting sonically. In this painting, the goal was to get a feel for how to play music through painting and not to create expressive music\n\nThis is an NFT of the final result, with my first name \"OZ\" overlaid on top and is a 687x659 cropped PNG\n\nLinks:\nSee the full session: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIeiLOrXWa0\nHear what it sounds like when played with more intent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBf7RLrICwY\nSee the Handsfree Userscript source: https://gist.github.com/ArtSeeClarke/c40d73d0426c2bf2a62296fc72da6a48", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma9EfSQPUAAyc9pmdBR2nSwStonA3LWYx2MxuJqFHcqUi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWGX7D73RtLu34L8UwwARoDBrZZHQdKeKbMgVsm5GgV76", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma9EfSQPUAAyc9pmdBR2nSwStonA3LWYx2MxuJqFHcqUi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iiYYsGEvf6RUZzxf9DU3u7hEKvwYEpSNf"], "tags": ["handsfree", "handsfreejs", "p5", "p5js"], "extra": {}}
