Either poached from the wild or bred in captivity on a farm, these animals suffer long before they reach our homes. Often, they\u2019re shipped long distances, and taken to countries vastly different from their original homes. Many exotic pets suffer and die in transit before they even reach their final destination.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTjifYuwASToJ3kzUenJ6mLtoTzYhVxdtJPT8P3Lw4Gzw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTjifYuwASToJ3kzUenJ6mLtoTzYhVxdtJPT8P3Lw4Gzw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTjifYuwASToJ3kzUenJ6mLtoTzYhVxdtJPT8P3Lw4Gzw", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2LrZ12heeFw8ivpAyLCDyt32C28yXi7a3z"], "tags": ["illustration", "artwork", "gif", "animal", ""], "extra": {}}
