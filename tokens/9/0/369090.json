Bapak has gone too fast and it seemed like everything would be fine but it turned out that the Almighty had other plans. Many people feel deeply indebted to Bapak, for his kindness to help those in trouble. After that, Bapak often says \"It's okay.. just take it easy.\" while chuckling then left. As I write this, it's been almost 11 months since he left us. May he now be in a better and peaceful place. May Allah Azza wa Jalla grant him goodness. Aamiin Ya Rabbal'Alamin.\n\n-\n\nAs a form of gratitude and pride as Bapak's son, I tried to make 24 articles with several different writings about Bapak in each article. Each will be sold as many as 24 pieces per article.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS3FSH63fEtu8TC2JU4feRBbp2gAhheqtweceCQMmB2fj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRhoWpnYSahYbjvMaxBeQ9s5391eqBDhJqm7N4JNDdJqE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS3FSH63fEtu8TC2JU4feRBbp2gAhheqtweceCQMmB2fj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1S9Rf5Wmreu25q51dQK9P74v4pnXEpmPYm"], "tags": ["Bapak", "2/24", "ondiii", "art", "painting", "paint", "astronaut", ""], "extra": {}}
