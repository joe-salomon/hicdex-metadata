Together with my Opa, she gave us many treats when I was a child, so that we would not experience the same. Rainbow cookies are an NYC treat that are so common in Jewish bakeries that only as an adult did I learn they are actually Italian. They have 3 thick cakey layers with jam between each one. Fruit jelly slices are an old treat that has mostly gone out of fashion.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX24zFHrEtpGeQQFdXJ8vXHPd1Hsa7bQdpgZAafA9AzzY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPMXXN4bJDkDr1xHvAuB813a3RHsscSmYxfgaKDeR7rCy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmfVJUoMHj14m1F8vAfsmyMwzMktYDXjjVG2s3oPqKiHvr", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX24zFHrEtpGeQQFdXJ8vXHPd1Hsa7bQdpgZAafA9AzzY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iEBj6JB2iKDUCg2DPcyxbB3p9caVPr7Sd"], "tags": ["Cookies", "pink", "cake", "bakery", "vanilla"], "extra": {}}
