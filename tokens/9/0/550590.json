{"__version": 1, "token_id": 550590, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Ila Lua - Avian Mythology", "description": "Analog drawings from the two sides of the same piece of paper. As the drawing, painting on the paper unfolds, so it bleeds through and gives rise to marks and foms on the other side. And so in circle the work switches from one side to the other using different analog media. These pieces are then brought together into a digital arrangement and worked on further digitally. \n\nIla Lua is an alias I use when I create at night. It means Moon Island \u2013 as the night is about solitude, depth, silences. Space and time of both opening and withdrawal. Ila Lua is fluid being of the night, sometimes moving through the outside spaces and sometimes through the inside regions. Night is about freedom and mystical being with the being itself. That is when messages lost in the noise of day can be heard, where forms and new syntheses occur. At night forms are not obvious, some become fluid. Some morph into metaphores and then dreams. At night is when mythical birds bring messages in languages that cannot be written. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZghPqZN8RY4MvEpkGgaEVH1eCa8wrodK6PBfwfBbFwKP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS9txyRtj3VJKL7YC7TfDap55qSxht44X4o8at9PGn2s8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZghPqZN8RY4MvEpkGgaEVH1eCa8wrodK6PBfwfBbFwKP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TqDPZMv4bq1WsnJrddopnXhXbwTV8DFwS"], "tags": ["drawing", "digital", "bird", "metaphor", "mythology", "illustration", "2d"], "extra": {}}
