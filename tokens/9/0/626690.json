I released my debut album exclusively there on my birthday in June 2020. The rewards I got from betting on the platform is not only the money from album sales, but this overwhelming sense of revelation that people are still willing to spend their time & money to get access to things that most people think should be easily accessible, if they trust you enough. \n\nThis is my way to celebrate the moment I became free. \n\nSince NFT also played a huge part in this realization, this is my way to bridge the so-called web 2 & 3. \n\n90% of the selling of this art will be contributed to everybody at The Storefront. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcx2Q6jgCyXPDFYVb6VtQT9JqxnJ3UNMHZS6wmKKwPsLQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPHvhuPLFzMRu9bSzVQCZduAPLBJA7PjKYxfM5HRLE3rX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcx2Q6jgCyXPDFYVb6VtQT9JqxnJ3UNMHZS6wmKKwPsLQ", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1dtuE72K5UAhabUF9GVPyoKspYaaJ8GaDo"], "tags": ["html"], "extra": {}}
