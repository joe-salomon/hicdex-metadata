{"__version": 1, "token_id": 419290, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "lossy 001: the three graces", "description": "Lossy is a series of works exploring ways of replacing cultural significance through degenerative processes such as medium transfer. The process, if successful, should result in no visible connection to the original subject. The result is circumstantial and subjective, degenerating the anthropomorphic and cultural bias of the original work. Studies for this series began in 2015, though it was only recently that the process and purpose became apparent by focusing on specific source works. The source works are digitally scanned sculptures typically depicting single or multiple anthropomorphic characters in settings of violence, exploitation, or hubris. The purpose of the result is to colonize the aesthetic memory of the subject.\n\n3992 x 3992, 14.4mb, jpg\n\n\u00a9 2021 Luis E. Fraguada.
