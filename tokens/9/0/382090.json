They stand closer to him in heaven and sometimes are sent to do his bidding.\nMaybe as some kind of act against god, Revenge for how weak and frail he made us, envious of how close the angels are to the throne, or maybe just to show the world how powerful we can be, we kill angels. We try to erase every single trace of god on earth until mankind can only look upon itself as it's savior.\n\n\n\n\n800x800gif made on a Deluxe Paint emulator for the MS-DOS", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSEf1ny5LfNRwAmxBgjfm98zHur4sh6WD38tfS3nSmQ8a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSEf1ny5LfNRwAmxBgjfm98zHur4sh6WD38tfS3nSmQ8a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSEf1ny5LfNRwAmxBgjfm98zHur4sh6WD38tfS3nSmQ8a", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1g1vaPjfjPj2q6gsg7ddNQAQao955YTGAQ"], "tags": ["angel", "killer", "deluxepaint", "EVA", "NERV", "voidhands", "wizards", "occult", "ms-dos", "sigil", "abandomware"], "extra": {}}
