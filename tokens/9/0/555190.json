Far from the glamorous beaches, the Sambadrome, and the crowd of tourists that descend on the city for the world famous parades, there is an explosive contest between suburban neighbourhoods. This old form of carnival features teams of masked clowns that are a surreal mixture of delight and terror. A tradition that has its roots in ancient European carnival traditions and in African rituals, they look like visitors from another world. This series was featured on Vogue Italia in a article about the intersection of Art, Beauty and Technology.
