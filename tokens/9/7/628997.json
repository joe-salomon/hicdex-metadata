I'm sure there are many, many solutions to this question and/or challenge, but there is one approach that made the most sense. What if we took the word PAINTING and then created a quasi-crystal lattice structure by simply adding more space between the letters and then connect the letters with lines? Also, what if we use a gradient to create the illusion of movement and/or lighted and shaded sides? And for good measure, let's throw the whole thing on it's side to exaggerate the perspective to create an almost cube like structure? What do we have as a result? We have successfully (or at least I think so) created a 3 Dimensional painting without a brushstroke, without a palette knife mixing colors, without drawing and/or underpainting, we've successfully hacked painting. (Cue the deafening sound of crickets chirping.) I would love to make something like this into a very large scale sculpture one day in the future.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNecYMftGw53fAqfUr2K95eFnJpUVvrwd8LvuRBquTPDF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfFQRedtoGKqy2SMkzA7FJx7BwnFJoExjs2kBoGRBAjeQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNecYMftGw53fAqfUr2K95eFnJpUVvrwd8LvuRBquTPDF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
