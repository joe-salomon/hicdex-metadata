I found myself captured by urban seating, benches, and strips of land seemingly fallen out of mind through the intersections between designed spaces.\n\nTo capture this process, I would take my camera along with me and photograph anything I thought may be of interest to the furthering of the project.\n\nThis collection is a curated reselection of the hundreds of photographs I ended up taking as a part of the project, focused on benches in Brighton.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdxDDVuZfyhjznvyuBkJWcAVyfreCFZhtim4inkKWUEc1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTV2GTKJqmLirvWmahSHqN7AJJS5b9aedVBjHE9uiT1So", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdxDDVuZfyhjznvyuBkJWcAVyfreCFZhtim4inkKWUEc1", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1MVEo9LSVY6DH74Ho92VzDf5GDgiCn85v6"], "tags": ["BrightonbyBench", "Photography", "photographycollection", "benches", "brighton", "derive", "assemblage", "sitting", "pdf"], "extra": {}}
