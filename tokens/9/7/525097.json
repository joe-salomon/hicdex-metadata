Europeans briefly farmed the island in 1851, before it was turned into a quarantine station in 1875, a hospital during the influenza epidemic of 1907, and a small leper colony from 1906 to 1925.\n\nDuring its time as a leper colony, fourteen men were sent there, and two died there.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSvXSpGes5cYsGnWeyvqU6QMWCQ1CHBN4Mtk9zZMeFcze", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX76AU1ZzCUF4bs9sg9mBL67Rw6hvtgRmJj36QYWFLN7Y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSvXSpGes5cYsGnWeyvqU6QMWCQ1CHBN4Mtk9zZMeFcze", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YehHK3z2KRZ2pNuQBTfocF1NvTLGvvSRk"], "tags": ["nature", "wilderness", "newzealand", "photography", "island", "ocean"], "extra": {}}
