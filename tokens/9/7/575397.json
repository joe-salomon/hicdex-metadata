What is the nature of the wager she proffers as she withstands a more ancient eternity than the blockchain? Time will tell. This powerful talismanic, auratic, iconographic portrait extends general good luck, health, assured victory in battle, material riches, and success in affairs of the heart to those who enter its aura. \n\n*This work was modelled on the cranial facial reconstruction of a Viking shield-maiden from 1000 years ago.\n\n\nwebsite: liviahortis.art\ntwitter: @LibiaeHortis \ncommissions and inquiries: libiae.hortis@gmail.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXMtaWGxTmQf9SfsWAudz5yxLzoTdzuWUfHEfKUaS6fRa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfQeD8iB1CFXdyRJMWnfLg9mo8B4vP5YrJzBm7VJVMdoH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXMtaWGxTmQf9SfsWAudz5yxLzoTdzuWUfHEfKUaS6fRa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iJ8RSnZx2DHWFrUrkSTrehGbtjU8paCqG"], "tags": ["goddess", "freya", "freyja", "norsemythology", "nordic", "scandinavian", "myth", "mythical", "mythology", "digitalillustration", "digitalart", "digitalhandpainting", "handpainted", "procreate", "nordicgoddess", "warrior", "womanwarrior", "goddessofwar", "godofwar", "godoflove", "goddessoflove", "armor", "armour", "sword", "holy", "viking", "medieval", "classical", "ancient", "talisman", "auraticart"], "extra": {}}
