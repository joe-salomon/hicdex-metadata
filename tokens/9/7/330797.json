By simply shifting the tongue slightly we have two totally different sentences with almost the same exact sound. Sometimes these sentences could be labelled as non-sense, which they could be, but in art not everything has to be logical or make sense in a linear fashion. Just like in modern or contemporary art, abstraction expands the mind and possibilities of what is or what could be. The abstraction here is within the syntax of these sentences. Could this just be a coincidence or is it that the true art of all of this putting the pieces together. Technically, everything that you see or hear in language already exists, you only need to write it out or speak it to create it. We create our own realities by willing it into existence. I love playing with things that seem the same, but are either opposites or have completely divergent meanings.
