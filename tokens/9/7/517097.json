Through online conversations, participants from all over the world are invited to describe how they feel. Their answers are then rendered by designers, giving these feelings a form. Constantly growing and evolving, the project exposes a global emotionality through the interpretation and translation of the invisible into digital corporeality.\n\nOral description: Shirin Anlen (Israel), 3D model: Camila Norambuena (Chile)\nProject by Catalina Tuca.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWBK4J3i7NcB4xQiy8fNz4vHHsziviqWNvPKc7VbbLg7S", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdWatCh7VuVaRLcgysTiRW6bfSJxSX69KSCLLZoMGadsP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWBK4J3i7NcB4xQiy8fNz4vHHsziviqWNvPKc7VbbLg7S", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eaEi3x3GBc7ZL2zVNv4B3k31TZErvEE4t"], "tags": ["lydianstater", "emotions", "global", "catalinatuca", "art", "contemporaryart", "thefalltheshow", "video", "videoart", "thesensitiveproject", "communication", "participation", "feelings"], "extra": {}}
