The footage was only aired once and was poorly received. One viewer commented: \"What a waste of 11 seconds. Actually, make that 55 seconds (cos I watched it 5 times)\". The footage was thought to have been destroyed, but was recently unearthed in an old abandoned warehouse. We can only watch now, and marvel at the legacy of the life of Nathaniel.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUNvSQVeiLfHZBS3NguSXgg7k4oGny1fx4EfYKGuWzjza", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQmbedHhSANw2WkoHGdfjMFfo6GKY8DXdGYdyTfQuvMDf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUNvSQVeiLfHZBS3NguSXgg7k4oGny1fx4EfYKGuWzjza", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ty3zxPSKtDbb532h3UKWff4SRG99BU26L"], "tags": ["mobotato", "2D", "3D", "loop", "animated", "looping", "life", "lifecycle", "documentary"], "extra": {}}
