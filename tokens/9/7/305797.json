So rugged and untamed, rocky and steep. Visitors with 2wd vehicles always commented on it being a challenge, fairly it was. After the fires had passed and we were ready to return, I couldn't help but think of the irony.

Preparing ourselves for what we would find on the other side.\"\n\nPhotography by Jay Moon, during the Australian wildfires; November 2019.\n#4 of 15.\nAll funds generated go toward the ongoing recovery.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdp3xHmP3ECSJ3z65tH1MvEGJ57JNDtzf3j911cUfw42D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNxi85pRXSCydvKPg3LC2jrZmZ8Koac5hNqD4wAmriRkw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://Qmdp3xHmP3ECSJ3z65tH1MvEGJ57JNDtzf3j911cUfw42D"}], "creators": ["tz2G2NzfXg5JDLcCQxGmToT8goBBGPwo1dtj"], "tags": ["photography", "fire", "australia", "wildfires", "natural"], "extra": {}}
