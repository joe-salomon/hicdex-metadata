Online shopping has always been her method of temporarily escaping from her troubles, typically spending between $50-$100 a week on online purchases, with a majority on clothes.\n\nIn the past year, she has been struggling to understand lecture concepts in her statistics classes. Despite studying hard, she is doing badly in her classes, which was discouraging for her.  \nTo keep up with her expenditures, she had taken up a part-time job instead of breaking the habit because online shopping makes her happy. \n\n\u201cWhen I online shop, I like that I can be in control of what I buy because I know and understand the clothes I like to wear,\u201d she said. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS7fbvsJik2owoNi929nztbYGMnvmJ5euS6AJr9eu8VrJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQFQ4HqNhBWBhoAdkmXK4Txxi9wqYFJd3Hdt33SkK8TwJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS7fbvsJik2owoNi929nztbYGMnvmJ5euS6AJr9eu8VrJ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2BmgosYQvrJhXmPqLFy44RjygiwdjyjTyj"], "tags": ["mentalhealth", "digitalart", "portrait", "expressionism", "photojournalism"], "extra": {}}
