Keep 2 tokens. One to sell, and one to keep if you like my art. Return the remaining tokens to me (andrevenancio.tez) so I can put them back on the market so other people have a chance to get them.\n\nIts very easy to identify accounts you interact with. So sending tokens or currency to other wallets doesn't really give you much anonymity.\n\nAppreciate yout time!
