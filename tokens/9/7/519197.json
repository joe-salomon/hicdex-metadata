{"__version": 1, "token_id": 519197, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "PASSOVERBREAD", "description": "When we think of PASSOVER, most of us think of the Jewish Holiday celebrating The Exodus, the freedom from slavery of the Israelites from Pharaoh Ramses II of ancient Egypt that followed the Ten Plagues. You would be correct in that presumption. Passover in this context is a proper noun (A noun denoting a particular person, place, organization, ship, animal, event, or other individual entity.) That being said, when we combine PASSOVER with BREAD, we get PASSOVERBREAD and passover bread is called matzah. Andrew, this looks like a mess...and it is! Perfect! Let's dive in deeper and see what we can find. We can create a sentence within this new union and see the following sentence emerge from within: PASSOVER READ AS A VERB. Interesting because the name PASSOVER comes from the book of Exodus, God commands Moses to tell the Israelites to mark a lamb's blood above their doors so order the Angel of Death will...wait for it...PASS OVER them and be spared the killing of the firstborn. Ooof what a wrathful God. Don't get on \"his\" bad side? So PASSOVER is a proper noun, based on a verb from an event that may or may not have happened.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYYBLQqHZXvbm8sRw5YM8fXH4xm26W83y5A63dPLaEX4i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNrzZf6JeZtVa5Y84Nmcsj4ZfVhSnujamMWWFKCB6qs5n", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYYBLQqHZXvbm8sRw5YM8fXH4xm26W83y5A63dPLaEX4i", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
