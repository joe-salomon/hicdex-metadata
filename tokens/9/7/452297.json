Most of the time, though, the normals of one society are the same as the abnormals of another. Because living standards and fundamental human rights are not equal everywhere. Furthermore, people's beliefs can lead them to commit horrible things. Anyway, in this distant place where I went, the devil is believed to exist, and ceremonies are done in his honor. Girls are groomed to be offered to the devil by their parents from an early age. They must learn to suture wounds in school and acclimate their bodies to pain as part of this preparation.During particular occasions, the devil (someone whose face no one has seen or heard from) selects and rapes one of the girls who have been prepared for him (!) Families are glad to be able to feed the devil and celebrate in the streets if the victim commits suicide after the rape. Everyone stopped talking to me when I understood the gravity of the situation and sought to interfere, and I was escorted out of the area with threats. No one has yet stepped in to assist those individuals.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXyqnLpUDaAajLsDZwXGqJQCf5otRmijHCp4nHAd66rFJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXyqnLpUDaAajLsDZwXGqJQCf5otRmijHCp4nHAd66rFJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXyqnLpUDaAajLsDZwXGqJQCf5otRmijHCp4nHAd66rFJ", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1dZDMAtyxM9nowWZm589fNAx3PXPtD9ZLX"], "tags": ["gif", "photography", "collectible", "collectibles", "doodle", "sketch", "experimental"], "extra": {}}
