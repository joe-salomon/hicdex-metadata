They are hidden among the thoughts while you drool in front of the fireworks of emotions.\nBut it is not so difficult to discover them, they are like a puppeteer using short strings. If you stop watching the show you will hear them whispering your immediate future.\nYou can catch a glimpse of the end of the snake every time it passes. But it is very difficult to see it appear.\nSo, thinking is voluntary? Not for most people. The automaton sector of the brain never has its tongue dry up. It can sing you a symphony during a nap.\nThere is no off button.\nThere is no window through which you can throw the TV.\nRarely does the tongue stop its snaking. But when it does, you find yourself in front of a welcoming abyss, you close your eyes and sigh deeply until you burst into the air like a balloon.\nYour last sound.\nNo more snakes.\nOnly your silence in space remains.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP6tmS6AVFcGJEWiPo7LZ7DnH3oTzz49X13APsfoYDY3M", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTUWjCNk1EfBr7kGBnDX9xhiXw8sUcWgMxXZkp8ge1mNT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP6tmS6AVFcGJEWiPo7LZ7DnH3oTzz49X13APsfoYDY3M", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LkZeTk6UoisEM1VvE7qWewjcE25hP9qNk"], "tags": ["#nftcollectors#NFTCommunity#NFTdrop#hicetnunc"], "extra": {}}
