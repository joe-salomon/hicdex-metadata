Originally worn as bathrobes, their modern use is much broader, and are a common sight in Japan during summer. Though yukata are traditionally indigo and white in colour, modern yukata commonly feature multicoloured designs, and are designed to be machine washable. They are similar in appearance to the nemaki, a unisex short-sleeved kimono-like garment worn by guests at traditional inns.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYYe5F44yMqxJntf4Vxs4zJNzUqy8fQzTbkE5nudSf46F", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme6FZV9FSTHs8UdhRXnU6AxbECfqgAaNA1bPgbFRWieTX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYYe5F44yMqxJntf4Vxs4zJNzUqy8fQzTbkE5nudSf46F", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2HQF9UPTuVPnrBZGbwhchaoDaM9nnMfHai"], "tags": ["Yukata", "twig", "smoke", "fire"], "extra": {}}
