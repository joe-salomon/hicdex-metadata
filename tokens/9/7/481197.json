To be the witness is to listen with a still heart, with a waiting, open soul, without clinging, without opinions\"\n\nWitness: It's dedicated to the first step one takes outside the life they knew bearing witness to the change along with their existence. Moving towards an endless question, the journey begins. Like light is a silent witness to the changing scenes, the self is to every thought.\n--\n\"BINARY EMOTIONS\" is a series based on 12 Single Edition Fragments in which the artist aims to translate his inner nuances within a specific moment into visuals that evoke certain emotions. An emotional journey digitized into a binary piece cataloged onto the blockchain.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcts8sUadvatjPvjcjGgVpZRQSfhpPa6arzknGcfKQd82", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZraFM619Pb6euFx7cLUtgW3mpZn8wygStQVC3w7c5uHL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcts8sUadvatjPvjcjGgVpZRQSfhpPa6arzknGcfKQd82", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bjGdjBLbwdr8ptGcjakKAeM6TLU6UzLgP"], "tags": ["witness", "life", "change", "thought", "dreams", "explore", "revive", "rare", "binary", "emotion", "journey", "nuance", "light", "", "fragment", "two", "series", "scifi", "animation", "glitch", "colors", "tech", "cyberpunk", "dark", "music", "sound"], "extra": {}}
