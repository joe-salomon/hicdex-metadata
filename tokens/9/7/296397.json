Which is pornography, religion, culture, etc. I am sick of it! I don't mean to fight against them. Just express me\u00a0through the arts. I create The Demit, people said it is inappropriate! It is porn! It's a sin! Big sin! I have no backup, intelligence is not enough for them. Just violence. They don't really care about what\u00a0I am trying to tell them through my arts. They see what they see. Also, I was disturbed by people who always blamed for all bad things happen to them. Someday, my brother died in a traffic accident and the one who hit him, he said that he was unconscious and didn't watch my brother ride through him. Like see a Demit (demon). It was at night, try to make it sense and be sorry. Until I heard that somewhere in Thailand if you did something wrong (crime) in this case you are possessed by a demon you free to go. Out of human law. But it is a higher level of law. I disagree if there is any mistake in what people do they always blame it on Demit. So through my words and illustrations,\u00a0I wanna ask people to think again and ask for ourselves that everything we do has a consequence and all about it is came from us. Not the others. You are your own demon.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeib3gz35ndbuu6upu7ii4zdjwivjfozhpjglqz2srizivmqlzdjxzm", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreieumx3yodppxct26pclwvrrbly74c7plt4zylcfb5q2hguaroanuu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeib3gz35ndbuu6upu7ii4zdjwivjfozhpjglqz2srizivmqlzdjxzm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gYUCjPztSCo2TSf2XBQY9Y3FH7amsuX79"], "tags": ["demon", "devil", "sin", "first", "born", "contemparary", "illustration", "oil", "painting", "art"], "extra": {}}
