Two of the planes were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third plane hit the Pentagon just outside Washington, D.C., and the fourth plane crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Almost 3,000 people were killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which triggered major U.S. initiatives to combat terrorism and defined the presidency of George W. Bush.\n\n2682 x 4032\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidomlj4rhdqg3seucxt7z6zphk2lyahfcyuoe7lqhfxwz7vapulle", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreia4tcu6gcpnzs7454qlxhxsdqzrb2um7pmq2dxizwmh3ldlfn4ljy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidomlj4rhdqg3seucxt7z6zphk2lyahfcyuoe7lqhfxwz7vapulle", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UBZJ7J4FzQxhsFYxkGo7pH53GmkG1kYBm"], "tags": ["11september", "11", "September", "attacks", "usa", "Washington", "build", "explosion", "2001", "unitedstate", "nft", "nfts", "poster"], "extra": {}}
