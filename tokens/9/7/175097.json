They all passed in horrific ways: One from cancer, one from suicide, and another from an overdose. The background is a vibrant and swirling texture which changes in the intensity of it's color, distortion, and turbidity but eventually returns to a calm and peaceful state.It represents the beauty of chaos. \n\nThe ocean reflects the chaos, absorbs it, and dissects the screen diagonally representing the the different ways we are pulled between the people that we love. It cradles, caresses, and heals. \n\nThe crown is actually an ode the family surname that I descend from and is the inspiration for my name in the crypto art world: Shabbas. The name means \"Valiant King\" and is believed to be derived from Abbas the Great of Persia (Shah Abbas). When my Great great grandfather immigrated to the USA from Persia (Iran), his name was changed to a more \"white sounding\" one. I'm happy that I can honor his legacy in this space, this piece is for him in a lot of ways.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYYG21sPzmubNN1Wm2jBYRaWDdygVr5KrzsDPocUi2vUb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeF5WABntGY9th1mRqNbAR4P1kxUWrtDgZhN5CGWoJ6o1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYYG21sPzmubNN1Wm2jBYRaWDdygVr5KrzsDPocUi2vUb", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2XNoyCcSnWHpnkhMcmuGa1DRPbLCG8SXUv"], "tags": ["hen200", "hen", "200", "trippy", "skull", "darkart", "animation", "video", "rainbow", "colorful", "positive"], "extra": {}}
