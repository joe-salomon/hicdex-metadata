Day and night, in the small alleys of residential areas, on the streets, with costumes, chains tied to the neck and monkey training skills have become a commodity of people's entertainment that continues to be forced to do entertaining scenes.\n\nAlthough many criticisms have arisen from many parties, who think that this business is a form of torture and a place of exploitation of primates.
