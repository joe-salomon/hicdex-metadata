The form is the source of an idea that grows attaching figurative motives to the AI generated abstraction. The static nature of this fusion between fine art and AI generated abstraction is extended with digital native expressive glitch mixture bringing live into the narrative.\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nExplorer and experimenter by nature, brutalisti's deep empathy lets him immerse into any art, culture or trend. His background of a tinkering with code, hardware, human emotions and physiology transfers into a exploratory style of creation. Giving the control over the creative process from the author to the artwork lets him discover alchemy like artistic infusion.\n\n\np.p \n\nJust joking guys. Bruta genrated 100 GAN, Bruta found a nice one, Bruta explored possibilities.  Bruta collaged some brain, draw some lips, arm, some nose and shadows. Bruta gliched some witches!
