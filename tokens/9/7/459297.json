And in those moments the inspiration came for this song to help uplift others who may feel the same and remind you that everything needed will be provided as long as you keep pushing forward.\nThis music NFT qualifies as one that can be collected to add to the 5 total needed for a collector to be considered a 'Distributor' and receive monthly Distributor pool payments from secondary sale royalties.
