That meeting turned into a business relationship where she did hair and makeup work for me with my clients. This particular set happened after a boudoir photo session she\u2019d worked on for me. She wanted to do a cosplay boudoir set featuring her Guardians of the Galaxy character, Starlord. The concept was to start with a more traditional boudoir and move into a fully clothed and realized gender bender character. We were about halfway into her costume at this point, you can even see a little bit of the headboard in this image. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPDRZWSLb2TFFf6GSCsQsmACSWUbDnmuD6WrKgaUeZEY3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVwU79WosBi6BUTYGNuy6yAUBxx7eRaCSGU9htZtjyo9T", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPDRZWSLb2TFFf6GSCsQsmACSWUbDnmuD6WrKgaUeZEY3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["boudoir", "sci-fi", "marvel", "movie", "galaxy", "stars"], "extra": {}}
