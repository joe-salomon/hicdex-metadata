The two also represent the symbol of the balance between antagonistic forces and infinity. The one on the right is called Od, which represents life freely directed; the one on the left Ob, fatal and smart life.\n\nAnother symbol of Hermes is his winged shoes, a pair of winged shoes forged by Hephaestus and delivered to the messenger god of Olympus. Since then, they have been used by Hermes or by whoever he finds worthy.\n\n\"A story about the world? Yes, yes, we know one\"\nThis is how the journey of the artists to show their vision about the Greek Gods and their form begins.\n\nPart of the #Cryptoamigues #CryptOlimpianos a collaborative event by artists based in Brazil.\n\n1000x1000 300 dpi | Art by @carlinbrt | 2021 | CSP", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUhN2CjYK1Gm4MqxNfaUT1m2ErXY1iersVmvRnCU4mQH5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNf8SdNJJT9a2EJ26jojNrVysTkxD33WEcsV7PeLyECTJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUhN2CjYK1Gm4MqxNfaUT1m2ErXY1iersVmvRnCU4mQH5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Puy3r8kRHeo3tkPMvynHqb66R3rEc6mk9"], "tags": ["concerptart", "god", "gods", "hermes", "digital", "ilustration", "brazil", "culture", "greek", "1/1", "jpeg"], "extra": {}}
