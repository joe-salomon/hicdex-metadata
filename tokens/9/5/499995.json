The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: I\u2019m at a museum browsing historical films. As an adult, I want to live in nature but can\u2019t seem to find it. In this scene two women, traveling in the same long corridor, meet someone I know. She is standing at the end of the corridor, checking tickets. After looking behind her, I ask her, \u201cWho\u2019s there with you?\u201d Without warning, she collapses, rolling to her left. Her head and shoulders have fallen on the seats in front of her. Her face is blank, lifeless, misshapen features reminiscent.\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 164 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmeh3eemsxrdmyAbHFwY33CceHNhZkaAvbXYaiTKbYRJq4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSkNk8ZBCgRTb2PK71jDiheh1MBTheqDTiEQEft4igDJK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmeh3eemsxrdmyAbHFwY33CceHNhZkaAvbXYaiTKbYRJq4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
