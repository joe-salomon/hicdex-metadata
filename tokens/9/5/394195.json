Unbearable shivers run down my spine and I feel like every hair on my body bristles as its precence is getting closer and closer... I don't know where I should walk, this forest is immense and full of mist. I think i'm lost. \n\nFinally I could see in the distance the place where this nightmare began, the abandoned factory that we were supposed to investigate. Reinforcements have arrived, I can see the lights on the police cars... But what the hell is going on? I try to run towards them but it's as if the place moves away from me with every step I take. I scream to them until I'm faint, but they can't hear me. They are entering the place... and I hear the sounds that beast does when approaching, this time with more violence, more savagery...\n\nTerror has completely taken over me, it's absolute terror, I've never felt anything like this in my entire life... Frightened, completely alone in the dark, I begin to embrace the idea that I will die in this place, in the most horrible way possible. I'm only worried about what will happen next, what kind of fate holds for my soul. \n\nI've come back to the coast, on the pier in ruins lies the corpses of my friends... A voice speaks to me, I hear it inside my head ... it's the devourer of the dead... now it's my turn to die...", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRAbyrP1Q4RDeKunT4Gzy9x1Gp6DJTUysuDP54HF5nvQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTP3CwJxUqsKWT1Q5ifQvotRpjbUpGgX2QJYWK8gHCA5e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSRAbyrP1Q4RDeKunT4Gzy9x1Gp6DJTUysuDP54HF5nvQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZJTQvxfGqoJeiRaoSRyh5GnrVp8ydQGD1"], "tags": ["Illustration", "character", "art", "painting", "drawing", "horror", "terror", "deathmetal"], "extra": {}}
