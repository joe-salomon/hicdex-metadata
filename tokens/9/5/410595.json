Whatever the style of the artist's style used in a work must contain a corona element in it. In my opinion, the corona virus has not only terrorized living things but has terrorized the creative process and the daily work of artists.\nArtist, especially fine arts, will certainly be affected by the corona outbreak as an idea in a work, not only novice artists who work, but also maestro-class artists are affected by this situation.\nObserving this is very interesting because it has resulted in this epidemic not only occurring in the medical world but also in the art world. Even though visually it does not use the form of the corona virus, the concept of the work must definitely be guided by this phenomenon, the concept must be contextual to the corona situation in it.\nFor me, corona is an epidemic that is eating away at the creative, conceptual and gallery areas, the art world is shaken by this pandemic, of course because this is an event that must be noted in the development of fine arts in this century, because this has influenced the world of art, which has created a new style, namely coronaism.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRDqG29kkr5j1a7pntdgshjXt5CTr5CRH22yXdKMJh72Y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfWnxc59tetbAiivrF6DPt62mKJDbtVeELrc1UbG52ZNP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRDqG29kkr5j1a7pntdgshjXt5CTr5CRH22yXdKMJh72Y", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bkijFBq4h4dmVa9TBANpaAABXti7zPY2v"], "tags": ["corona", "3d", "illustration", "covid-19", "surrealism"], "extra": {}}
