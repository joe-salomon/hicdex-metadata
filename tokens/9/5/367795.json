It is practiced by adherents of many religions as a means to appease a deity or deities or change the course of nature. It also serves a social or economic function in cultures where the edible parts of animals are distributed among those who attend sacrifices for consumption. Animal sacrifice has appeared in almost all cultures, including in Indonesia. Sometimes in the construction of a building, animal sacrifices are still carried out to honor or ask permission from the ancestors. Or in other cases, animal sacrifices to ask for prosperity for residents who still believe in things like this are still being carried out until now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQQ7T4WWb94inxci2tXkLmBvRJVvxCFk7LjzY5XNNC1aM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT3bFiC3aL4c3NRqsgAf9hpToGAb9onJuPZDiYVAagakt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQQ7T4WWb94inxci2tXkLmBvRJVvxCFk7LjzY5XNNC1aM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ibWZs5gdSGvX9TYPEot9GftH4jVQn2wXm"], "tags": ["skull", "darkart", "pointilsm", "culture", "horror", "digitaldrawing", "dotwork", "stipple", "stippling", "artwork", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
