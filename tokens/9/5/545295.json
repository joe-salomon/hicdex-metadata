{"__version": 1, "token_id": 545295, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Nuda Veritas", "description": "Despite post-truth scenarios, Hackatao devoted an exhibition to the truth: The Truth Is, on at Zanini Arte, Mantova, 2019-2020. Many works displayed come to life through AR, and paradigmatic of the whole exhibition is Nuda Veritas, first artwork presented at the Booming Contemporary Art Show in Bologna as both physical piece and animated gif tokenized on SuperRare. Elegant, bare, personified truth awaits as a rich allegory at the threshold of an unknown dimension. Her motion reminds of Foucault\u2019s pendulum while echoing with the inexorable ticking of a grandfather clock, hinting at the Earth\u2019s rotation and the passing of time. In fact, Hackatao\u2019s truth is relative, subject to the changing winds and seasons as the roses she holds. However limited by the very system that originates it, naked truth shows herself to those who know how to look at reality. As for cryptoart, tokenizing an artwork equates to certifying a small portion of truth for the collectors who believe in it, always ready to track down each unique manifestation of nuda veritas they find.
