We lived in this huge, amazing studio in Downtown LA that Sylva built and decorated herself. While we lived together we started a year long photo project called \"A Year Without Clothes\". Each day we would do one photo of her clothed and one photo of her in some state of nudity. While we didn't succeed in doing it every day for a year we did make a massive amount of wonderful images. This is one of them. Sylva is wearing a headdress that she made using porcupine quills.
