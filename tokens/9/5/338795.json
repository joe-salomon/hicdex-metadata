I was close and couldn't see the whole shape but it looked like a boat with a goose standing at the front of it.\nAt its commands were two figures with pointed faces, resembling men with the heads of goose.\nI looked in front of me and could feel the scene accelerating. We were flying at high speed over (or maybe in) a tubular road. Around the road were spiraling blue and red ribbons.\"\n\nPart 1/3 of the \"Corridor\" series.\n\nArtwork by DMT Vision\nwww.dmt-vision.net\nInstagram : @dmt_vision\n\nMuch love !", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQgxn9AtXZaCaWQQGAFWCJuwnQqPgKECjJd4c8XWh6ruW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbous7g6DvvVzuSe2mrqLCJaNNDR5EwTcwqKHwe2xjJMw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQgxn9AtXZaCaWQQGAFWCJuwnQqPgKECjJd4c8XWh6ruW", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XoEt76N3nsnmBrCQjmrrUnq2ebqcYpfZU"], "tags": ["dmt", "vision", "departure", "corridor", "music", "musicvideo", "animation", "film", "psychedelic", "drawing"], "extra": {}}
