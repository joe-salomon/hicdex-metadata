It is a good hour to begin to exist.\nAnd Dublin is a city where 1 a.m. tastes even more special. Stout, whisky, cigarettes and musicians. Here, we know that joy and melancholy are two sisters that must be embraced in turn.\nI like to take obscure photos of these atmospheres, the sharpness and the technique are brakes to the deployment of the memory of this gaze. Failed, imperfect, marked with regret for a perfection dreamed of, fantasized. These are the photos that I like.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZq2pTVMop5Ao9CmGVZdJH4FRPZD9JhAPTjUJn1GS7Q41", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW7maQxpvFiCP2Q3XVZedW3HW18pfYKMkL4qz9y9Wdnm9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZq2pTVMop5Ao9CmGVZdJH4FRPZD9JhAPTjUJn1GS7Q41", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bdQSVe6rYXDRnd7QDvhV5wfp1sUQJ8QBX"], "tags": ["photography", "B&W", "silverfilm", "Cohentribute", "Dublin", "pub", "dark", "man", "shadow"], "extra": {}}
