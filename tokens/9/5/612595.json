The problem with this belief is that it fails to perform many of the functions that sociologists like Parsons or Malinowski suggested religion should perform, because it offers little comfort. Indeed, people were leading these ascetic, joyless lives without knowing if they were to receive any reward in heaven. This contributed to a sense of anxiety, sometimes described as salvation panic. This led to Calvinists looking for signs from God that they were indeed among the elect (those who would go to heaven). They increasingly came to see success as a sign, and therefore threw themselves into their work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSrcikksqF2EQ4wXGxmJjmqCmNGQndtWhUAiwanigU3rs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXb1jKdbKD1jxzzs4pLMH9M42C9xxxFCEFophpB16hvHG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSrcikksqF2EQ4wXGxmJjmqCmNGQndtWhUAiwanigU3rs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1bxELmi7d3DV7i9weQwUexCfPhCs5nM6Lo"], "tags": ["illustration", "artwork", "contemporary", "digital"], "extra": {}}
