They are considered a type of y\u014dkai (supernatural beings) or Shinto kami (gods). The tengu were originally thought to take the forms of birds of prey and monkey deity, and they are traditionally depicted with human, monkey and avian characteristics. Sarutahiko \u014ckami is considered to be the original model of Konoha-Tengu (a supernatural creature with a red face and long nose), which today is widely considered the tengu's defining characteristic in the popular imagination. He is the Shinto monkey deity who sheds light on heaven and earth. Some experts theorize that Sarutahiko was a sun god worshiped in Ise region prior to the popularization of Amaterasu.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmThX2Myt5iLVF9TvX31fxfxBPPN6bE7Mmnwq4oZQMAaNh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZBiGGDHrhNo1dpSoBpNBj3tc2u4gHJj7SAdxSBT6bSvX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmThX2Myt5iLVF9TvX31fxfxBPPN6bE7Mmnwq4oZQMAaNh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cyLmFrjwBPZz1o22ogJavYJq7yqibfY6A"], "tags": ["tengukarasuillustrations"], "extra": {}}
