It was late in the evening and I was laying in bed, room completely dark, and I was experimenting with some new ideas for poems and then it hit me. I randomly smelled patchouli and felt invisible rays of ultraviolet light surrounding me and bringing silence and peace. I was at a state of equanimity (Evenness of mind; that calm temper or firmness of mind which is not easily elated or depressed; patience; calmness; composure.) It's at these moments, the world shuts off and the writing begins. If someone tells you that cannabis is an illegal drug and that it's immoral, walk away from them. There are no such things as good drugs or bad drugsI There are chemicals that are neither good or bad, they just exist. It either existed already in the universe or we created it. The problem is the relationship people have with said chemicals.
