A superb MetaTanzanite.\n\n-- The history of tanzanite --\n\nIn the 1960s , a severe thunderstorm hit the Merelani Hills in Tanzania , hills close to Africa's highest peak , the famous Kilimanjaro . Frightened, the Maasai nomads who lived there fled.\n\nOn their return, they found very shiny blue stones on the ground . They brought the mysterious stones to a local explorer who, unable to identify them, sent them to a gemologist in Arusha in northern Tanzania .\n\nHe was also unable to identify them and, in turn, sent them to his father, also a gemologist , who lived in New York .\n\nIn the United States , the stones were analyzed at the GIA (Gemological Institute of America, world reference in gemmology) which rendered the following verdict : the stones were a blue variety , hitherto unknown, of zoisite , a gem that does not was until then known only in a brownish color .\n\nExposed to a temperature of 600 degrees , the stones had taken and kept a blue verging on purple , unique.\n\nA few years later, the owner of Tiffany & Co jewelry , H. Pratt, fell head over heels in love with the Zoisites of Tanzania and renamed them Tanzanites, in homage to their country of origin.\n\nCreated by Roman Guillermo // 10.10.2019 // MetaTanzanite // romanguillermo.tez", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaAKgsfJ7xxkbjwAecrGLMEGQMWej1kuuJfPbmJ6o95HE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaAKgsfJ7xxkbjwAecrGLMEGQMWej1kuuJfPbmJ6o95HE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaAKgsfJ7xxkbjwAecrGLMEGQMWej1kuuJfPbmJ6o95HE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RUEhqJV6SKcr59vZWoR47iW45EUnDavoH"], "tags": ["digitalart", "gems", "tanzanite", "generativeart", "HDR", "colorfull"], "extra": {}}
