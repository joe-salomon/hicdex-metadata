It is natural, but cultural values need to be preserved somewhere. I think NFT is well suited for this purpose.\n\nRather than focusing on a single piece of graffiti, I chose a photo of multiple pieces of graffiti that come together to form a single landscape.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXBYn8wRJHSS7358pWnDvsFVnuDGtyy8Eu7GVCkfYcD66", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdH7CPf4ruNM1VAoTKpueKwjfwuxy2E8vbVEqGPWmdS9L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXBYn8wRJHSS7358pWnDvsFVnuDGtyy8Eu7GVCkfYcD66", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NvmhEqecNG6qw53cNrBBtgAJAom4Haf7k"], "tags": ["street", "graffiti", "photography", "tokyo"], "extra": {}}
