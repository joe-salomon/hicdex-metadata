Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31 they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.\n\ndigital painting\n3508 x 3861 px\n\nPersonal use only.
