The viewer brings their imagination to the work. It can\u2019t be avoided and the mixture of my art and their/your thoughts makes something else. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbgVGThVf1VCTiJN2enZUBPpVu3WWECMGVU2TUHX6PseE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeSbogZJBj39ZoiiigSMPREQWWq1ei85qV4EfoEVm7HNf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbgVGThVf1VCTiJN2enZUBPpVu3WWECMGVU2TUHX6PseE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NHP2mmBNbagWLLnaKM3C1QCtmuk2Qjg26"], "tags": ["abstract", "non-objective", "abstrktobjkt", "fineart", "metaphysical", ""], "extra": {}}
