On the way, if the road taken is sometimes smooth or damaged, we must also be ready to face it. driving using a motorized vehicle is a form of traveling far or near the place we are going. The farther the distance we travel, the more preparation we need. Even though the preparations we imagine are sufficient, we often find obstacles in the middle of the road that we never expected so that we too have to adapt to the situation so that we have experience that might be used in the future.\n\nThis work was created as an inscription of heartbreak and happiness that was painted for almost 365 days. and hopefully the coming year will be better than this year.
