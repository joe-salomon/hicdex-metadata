She is a big inspiration for me.  \nToday she is turning 93 years old. \nToday Im also uploading my first NFTs edition :) \nHope Grandma gives me good luck!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaCTqgyeQiqzki77Bmw9u4BsAWhQEx9Asz8YkAuRtRiwm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNnnr35qQH9cq3x6gyggVEPPiUuAB2wWYsayUjyyoKSjR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaCTqgyeQiqzki77Bmw9u4BsAWhQEx9Asz8YkAuRtRiwm", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XoH3c1HsHDFjiTyrWqxHU4qZ6vPzmM1vK"], "tags": ["#KeepMovingForward#GrandMaLove#plants"], "extra": {}}
