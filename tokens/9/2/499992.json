The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: War\u2019s a possibility. We should prepare. I go to a war memorial located in a residential area with many trees and shrubs. At first, the area is empty. Then there is a tapping, the tapping becomes regular. I think, \u201cThis is when the bomb\u2019s going to go off.\u201d When I emerge, the man I\u2019m fighting has a wall painting hung up in his bedroom. It\u2019s similar to the style of Canetti\u2019s da Vinci, but much looser, less detailed, and much of it pasted together. He\u2019s done this only once. The painting shows a U.S.S.R. submarine in World War I. The foreground is green; behind it, a burning U.S.S. Maine. The capsule rises like a Russian cathedral, like the Russian Orthodox church in Moscow, like the Black Sea Fleet in Ukraine. At the same time, I\u2019m engulfed.\n\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 154 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaZ4hv4pUDrVQQhdNn1PWofURBmByrmZHXVr73sdCqywn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQSDrK4JqW9qdCRoJokmbvcrcitWqwFi2CFwqg8eJvWGb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaZ4hv4pUDrVQQhdNn1PWofURBmByrmZHXVr73sdCqywn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
