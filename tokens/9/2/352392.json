One way or another, hate to break it to you, but we're all gonna die. Gee...thanks Andrew, like we didn't know that already. I know that you know that I know that you know that we're all going to die, but if you really think about it. Not death per se, but the acceptance of it as the most natural part of life. Life becomes much more vivid, like you're wearing 3D glasses to watch the movie of your life. You begin to see the bigger picture that your ego is not the center of the universe. Time for us mortals is finite. And right on cue...of course he's another Alan Watts quote, \"Imagine the idea that the moment you were born you were kicked off the edge of a precipice, and you are falling. As you fell, a great lump of rock came with you, and it\u2019s traveling alongside you. And you\u2019re clinging to it for dear life! And thinking, \u2018Gee, I\u2019ve gotta hold onto this.\u2019 You see? Well, it doesn\u2019t do a thing for you. And it\u2019s only making you anxious, and as soon as you understand that it doesn\u2019t do a thing for you that you let go and relax.\" Once you let go of anxiety of death, it becomes like a prism of life, not a prison of life.
