In the 16th century, Europeans arrived in North America for the first time.\u00a0 \nThinking they arrived in India (Asia), they mistakenly called the natives \"Indians\".\u00a0 \nTherefore, the natives of the Americas are known as \"Indians\" as the English word for Indian people.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYaE6Y9KnatR5QgJAHS7bW4SbQs8cxoN985sojp3osAaH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR2MdUUYwhWzdSmENnvovU78QRi92RaESQ6pT5iYbMdLk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYaE6Y9KnatR5QgJAHS7bW4SbQs8cxoN985sojp3osAaH", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XHpYogE1NK7WpdRSmTn7J14HonR11Mtjd"], "tags": ["Postage", "stamp", "history", "america", "usa", "indian"], "extra": {}}
