The child of a Famous Puppeteer, #12 was harshly trained in the Dark Arts of \"Necro-teering\", or formally known as: the Animation of the Dead. The Act of Animating the Dead in any Necromantic Ritual, prosecutable by the Courts of Animus led to the capture and execution of #12's Father, though the Vacant Soul was able to escape. The only area of Animus that could accept this Soul and their eccentrics, happened to be the thriving Underworld. A Strange Family of Misfits and Freaks, the Motleys accepted #12 with open arms.
