{"__version": 1, "token_id": 454392, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Psyche Unmasking", "description": "The image, \"Psyche Unmasking\" depicts an original photograph of an original acrylic painted mask. The creator used two growth stages (fruits and flowers) of the cherry tree to illustrate one's concept of the \"human psyche\". As it takes a cherry tree a lot of energy to produce flowers and fruit, it takes a lot of energy to create and maintain a balanced human psyche. The term, \"psyche\" is usually defined as \"the totality of the human mind... conscious and unconscious\". Hence, the image was created to reflect an individual's interpretation of consciously existing in a systematic manner while unconsciously embracing a random manner similar to blossoms blowing freely in the wind. \n\nThe processes used in creating the image included acrylic painting, photography, artificial intelligence, and algorithms. The animation was added to amplify the presence of tension and overlap while integrating \"conscious and unconscious\" in order to create and maintain a balanced human psyche.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPBiukAQGHksqL8J9noWigPUrE9G1gq7VBgVBUJ2tpoEZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQo16Y5ECYMTu2s3ofLRhgbVPvZoKRnZ28MAkvtX79unj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPBiukAQGHksqL8J9noWigPUrE9G1gq7VBgVBUJ2tpoEZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XQeAkWGur8esmmuChxBN5VTZk4X3Z48gH"], "tags": ["psyche", "mind", "conscious", "unconscious", "cherry", "cherries", "flowers", "blossoms", "animated", "artificial", "intelligence", "animation", "algorithm", "AIart"], "extra": {}}
