In this piece there is a father, mother, and new born daughter united as one. There is no perfect family but there is always love, that\u2019s why I wanted to intertwine the family all together and not make each family member so visible. Then there are two things you should give your child, that is roots as you can see in the form of plants and flowers on this piece and and wings to let them fly on their own, so that is portrayed by the birds in the piece. As for home, home is where the family is.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVAYwtRY3i2pmg4EuGFFD5rcm8YSzt2pNr63PbfSWb6od", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWtjqKEn9k6wvsPiGzUV79dk5j66TVcEN2U3Gh2NXVrB2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVAYwtRY3i2pmg4EuGFFD5rcm8YSzt2pNr63PbfSWb6od", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2H4ZfCbgJ3YEYZPn6D4itMQV6bgHg8cTuh"], "tags": ["truesy"], "extra": {}}
