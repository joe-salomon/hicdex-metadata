In the Adinkra symbol system, Solomon\u2019s Knot is interpreted as meaning \u201cone being bad makes all appear to be bad\u201d.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQZrJfbKe9A6W4RqbmNf1rNnhMAM2LW3zBGReP1s8Semf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbM5euv9gCfTvVMsLGWrqnjLujBvoERj6VTitzBsQJNve", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQZrJfbKe9A6W4RqbmNf1rNnhMAM2LW3zBGReP1s8Semf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iDQED34wbhZ68JapwSW1UhwPvwREP7u3E"], "tags": ["illustration", "digital", "abstract", "history", "video"], "extra": {}}
