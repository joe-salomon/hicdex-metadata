My husband, as a game industry worker, expects NFT to appear in games that accept tokenized artifacts. The game artifact will then become one of a kind. I'm still of the opinion in this discussion that there will be a place for digital art too. And in five years, the sale of such content will be the same norm as microstock and print shops are now. I hope in your project you can tell a little bit about how it all works, because so far it's something rather abstract for me :) nevertheless it would be very interesting to participate, especially since I deal mostly with vintage letters. And the combination of past and future seems to me to be a great idea!\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVzJ7rxkijN1RzhBCBD3ZZWyEsdLbRYgd5DgcNAquGqjk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV5Vp9tEgCS5P2uXLvRwVAhjNdd6v9kKsWqY3t6vpmyMf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVzJ7rxkijN1RzhBCBD3ZZWyEsdLbRYgd5DgcNAquGqjk", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cgT6gJt2YBBP4R9vnSYBaxre8E3PNk6wn"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
