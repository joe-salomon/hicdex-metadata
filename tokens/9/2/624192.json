Then I had to make the achievement requirements more difficult and I resolved in adding the constraint to have 188 followers too (I doubled the 100)\n\nThis artwork had been sleeping since when I reached 180 followers. As some time had passed and it's details blurred into my mind, the fear of missing out the exact numbers of followed and followers made me think it was time to mint it. So I did and announced it, but then I realized my mistake and I decided to burn the wrong description NFT and mint this one. As the true meaning of the artwork is to celebrate the 100 followed and the artwork was already been shown I didn't wait to get 188 followers anymore\n\nTo be honest the artwork is not finished yet: there are inconsistent behaviours depending on browsers and other external factors.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWcPEGTo9wYwnUcaphXBdMR1WaGZwfKFRSsnwUiYQfkcz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYKEicR8C69Nv7a1S4LfvAQ84ne247fcsaZkcc9qXZTZW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWcPEGTo9wYwnUcaphXBdMR1WaGZwfKFRSsnwUiYQfkcz", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1TRo6E7mkWVXXbr6bqadKozg3yV3FhnbL2"], "tags": ["100", "188", "followed", "interactive", "100(*2=188)", "Beppe"], "extra": {}}
