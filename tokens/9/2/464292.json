Its a neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction, in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles. Acetylcholine has been implicated in learning and memory in several ways. Evidence has continued to accumulate suggesting that the cholinergic system (i.e. Acethylcholine) has a important role in mood regulation, maily in depression and bipolar disorder.\n\n>> The vibration and movement of these molecules are performed by calculus of simulation called Molecular Mechanics where each molecule optimizes its geometry trying to get the lower energy possible.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTL995sCrJTesGXZZTcwEZgJfJoToiT16U4V4QmgjzR7W", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbFFH71nwUk8xyyUWkqoWjoXdNqjTqvGu32frDAxEDhiH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTL995sCrJTesGXZZTcwEZgJfJoToiT16U4V4QmgjzR7W", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PgPj2SAdBWo5dfJPXpGLZRsi44w2pPjN3"], "tags": ["tezchem", "chemistry", "molecules", "molecular", "vibration", "computing", "substances", "movement", "methabolism", "humor"], "extra": {}}
