Dithering with the Stucki algorithm provides texture and continuity across the saturated palette. There are well-defined edges although they are bristling with noise. Successive rendering steps allowed for the development of a phosphor glow, increased saturation, vibrance, and contrast while purposefully keeping the frame rate and overall resolution low (constraints that serve to put us in the dreamy zone).\n\nMPEG-4 Video\n640x360x10s @ 14fps", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSFEAKnsccNAiAJam3d5yZvJsU4MwZEreuC2Am88NYjZT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ67bJM24u7pksf99t7Xx83PXu6QoTmER4G6TvFQTmKku", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSFEAKnsccNAiAJam3d5yZvJsU4MwZEreuC2Am88NYjZT", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1THMezT7jXsbHeyX7NwQWnUAwxRd3BtYmy"], "tags": ["looping", "colors", "movement", "dithering", "shading", "bright", "dark"], "extra": {}}
