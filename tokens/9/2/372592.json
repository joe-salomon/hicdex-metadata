But once we pay attention to the details, to the story behind each material, we see a very different universe. We find a riot of emotion in minimalism. We discover the infinitely beautiful world of technology. We get more pleasure from less.\n\n\n\nI purposely did not write what this material is, and how it is produced. My goal is to give you meditative pleasure in looking at this work, so your brain can draw pictures of cotton picking, transporting, processing, and yarn. Perhaps looking at these textures will lead you to something deeper and more interesting. I suggest listening to dub-techno music in the background.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWjwMp1BNVPkrMpdEaHZp3GSGLdcjhhHQAyjMQccxaL3h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWjwMp1BNVPkrMpdEaHZp3GSGLdcjhhHQAyjMQccxaL3h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWjwMp1BNVPkrMpdEaHZp3GSGLdcjhhHQAyjMQccxaL3h", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QKKFUeq9mM2baPTfSnzxbJ1Bw7prmvxKv"], "tags": ["Materials", "material", "cotton", "fabric", "fabrics", "macro", "macrophoto", "clean", "monochrome", "experimental", "gurinoleg", "meditative", "minimal", "minimalistic", "techno", "dubtechno"], "extra": {}}
