{"__version": 1, "token_id": 521792, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "mask6", "description": "This is the initial image that this series of masks was generated from, the mask itself was created by a Chokwe artisan from the DRC in the late 19th or early 20th century. \n\nI used p5js to dither the image, a mobile app to add filters and noise, and then used ESRGAN to create the glitch textures. I believe that it is sufficiently removed from the initial photo to be it's own original art piece, although all credit should go to the original anonymous artisan.\n\nThere is a long bloody history of African artists being robbed by European and American artists and that was the initial motivation for this series, I love this mask and hope you do as well.
