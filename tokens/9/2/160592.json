Austin, Texas 1963", "description": "This is the old railroad bridge crossing the Colorado River near downtown Austin, Texas captured in 1963. This was during the height of the Civil Rights and Anti-war movement and demonstrations, and the RESIST! graffiti on the bridge for \u201call to see\u201d was highly controversial at the time. This is the first NFT minting by a 75 year old technophile (called an \u201cegghead\u201d during the day) and the first of a series of never before seen historical photos from this era. This original photograph was taken on 35mm Ektachrome with a Praktica FX2 SLR.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZuNvKnoysse5MypDvcv5rgHYc3ypERwV6Cq54UNazMtr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRhuziAWBySxhb6PCKaVmn5otTbVZBavLXguj9TgYMdaK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZuNvKnoysse5MypDvcv5rgHYc3ypERwV6Cq54UNazMtr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YmwJZfEerVMbc8uuJc7xUzE64ma3Xfu7L"], "tags": ["Austin", "Texas", "Bridge", "Colorado", "River", "60's", "Civil", "Rights", "History", "Historical", "Protest", "Power", "City", "Resist", "Anti-war", "1963"], "extra": {}}
