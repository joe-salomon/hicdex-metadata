{"__version": 1, "token_id": 630392, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Specials 3", "description": "Specials is an organic explorative connection and growth system, currently releasing its voracious veins on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nThe piece was created with someone specific in mind. The person named in Specials 3 was chosen by our dear friend, the freakishly talented @davidcheifetz. The piece contains the Twitter handle (mostly obscured) of an artist, collector, or friend. If all editions are collected, the name will be revealed here in a WIP pic. The person named in the piece gets two things:\n\n1) An edition airdropped. If he/she has already collected one, they can choose to get the airdrop, or name someone else it should go to.\n2) They nominate the name to be contained in the next piece.\n\nOne edition will be held aside for the first person to correctly guess who is named in the piece. If no guesses, the edition will become available. \nHints: Her work is so utterly mind-blowing it crushed a tornado in Wichita yesterday, froze an ocean of lava on Mercury this morning, and continues to regularly break the brains of human beings all over the world.\n\nFollow for additional hints and much more: @kellybrnz\n2000x2000 300 ppi. Edition of 11 @ 1.5 tez. @kellybrnz Thank you!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVQMsQNGKcn7cVZLA8czYBFULjisD7KRzxcgCNkqY9APQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP4umpRdbkZQmiCG9GfmKvhToVGBa5TANZwxDu9YtzwPL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVQMsQNGKcn7cVZLA8czYBFULjisD7KRzxcgCNkqY9APQ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WHu4vZ6u4K5hQ9nivu9UP4HGzEQEsZxmG"], "tags": ["Kels", "KelsBu", "KellyBurns", "art", "friends", "specials", "color", "waves", "warp", "abstract", "connect", "share", "evolve", "KelsSpecials", "@kellybrnz"], "extra": {}}
