I love this one so much that I wanted to see if altering the colors and lightening the tone could create a different emotional look and feel to it. The pastels and almost invisible qualities imbue a sense of ethereal temporality. Our lives are temporal moments of consciousness strung together like pearls on a string. I wanted to emphasize that feeling. The variant works just as good as the first and yet completely different.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ94MDgjZGD63M3JxGeyF2ZLYAmz8CgTytNDL9F2Feqir", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeVE85zkxYoXvkiti3NxXw4cnwvB3QVvkXzshRSdmJpLK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ94MDgjZGD63M3JxGeyF2ZLYAmz8CgTytNDL9F2Feqir", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
