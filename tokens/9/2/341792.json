It's the ultimate point for watching, a little higher on the ground where we can see all parts of our village, and also the next village far away.\nThe village ends here, we stop to visit our shelter.\nThis is the window to the left. Window to the left is for watching our own village and Karkas mountains. Also, this is always the kind frame guarding our stuff, usually a bottle of water and my camera bag.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS9BMWgHHCeibqcQ7cq1TABeWM9SSqt4f3kZvyyHDmt6W", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZCDUMUPdCvEnKr76qTEoxYMA3Q8auLJHPWZWtyMzvEtt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS9BMWgHHCeibqcQ7cq1TABeWM9SSqt4f3kZvyyHDmt6W", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "landscape", "window", "people", ""], "extra": {}}
