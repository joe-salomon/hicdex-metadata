He is The One who creates all means of nourishment and gives them their livelihood. He is the provider of growth for all things good for the body, the soul, and the mind. \n\nIndeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm possessor of strength. (Quran 51:58)\n\nO mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded? (Quran 35:3)\n\nPractice giving freely, \u201cAnd spend [in the way of Allah] from what We have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says, \u201cMy Lord, if only You would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be among the righteous.\u201d (Quran 63:10)\n\nAnd those who emigrated for the cause of Allah and then were killed or died \u2013 Allah will surely provide for them a good provision. And indeed, it is Allah who is the best of providers.
