Brain all over the street and sometimes in the heat his brain grease seeps into the asphalt. One time in a puddle of brain grease we set off a whole roll of caps with a hammer and damn near deafened me into my 30s. The brain grease caught a flame and shone bright neon green for what felt like a lifetime.\" - Deleted 2012 facebook post by Taran Noah Smith", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma9TyeFtVVgtnoibsPW3mNgDvR3wBqrefUo7nZr6r5JVB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPPP4W2rea3tc7p6jzLY8TwYybovVh6KD47sAyU2DXkys", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma9TyeFtVVgtnoibsPW3mNgDvR3wBqrefUo7nZr6r5JVB", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RVT2i9H21vTcJVshBoocoz2ZcAYUiEnF6"], "tags": ["feedback", "analog", "vhs", "zakloyd", "gnosis", "occult"], "extra": {}}
