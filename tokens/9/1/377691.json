Mechanically simple with a small footprint, the paternoster was easy to use in many places, including inside buildings.\n\nRotary lift parking systems operate like a Ferris wheel: cars are parked in suspended cages attached to a belt, one car at a time, the entire series of cars rotated until the next cage is at the bottom. Powered by electric motors or hydraulic pumps, they are actually less expensive per parking space because they use less ground and require less structure to be erected around them.\n\nThe earliest such parking systems in the US appeared in L.A., New York, and Chicago in the 1920s.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT66Pm5qFtdgwYxXPDitVQJwDSqj7xxVD1GooYo9GZ5AK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeoUv5pLgLMLsFzVm5SWFJAHJDZmMtcvYMSKq9Kf7g8ZC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT66Pm5qFtdgwYxXPDitVQJwDSqj7xxVD1GooYo9GZ5AK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hWWZGzwLCvA1BZEoKFNWe9LyxWrk6iaHy"], "tags": ["historical", "photos", "rare", "nft", "1920", "parking", "new-york", "1920", "time", "history", "collector", "xtz", "tezos", "hicetnunc"], "extra": {}}
