(I'm definitely not seeing enough hands in the air...disappointing.) But wait Andrew, isn't a palindrome supposed to have the ability to be read backwards and forwards? Yes, true! Great eye there, reader! The title says: TEL AVIV A JET. This is NOT a true palindrome, but if we make the \"J\" look like a backwards \"L\", then we have a visual palindrome. Take a second glance now. See it? The middle letter is \"I\" and as you build the word out from that point, all the letters mirror each other (with exception to the letter \"E\"). So, it works and doesn't work at the same time, so sue me. There are plenty of examples of visual palindromes out there, but none quite like this one. It's unique, quirky, and fun.
