It could be a pop-culture figure, an original idea they have, my take on their own artwork. Let's play!\n\nI will then work my magic to summon this Creature, mint the design and directly transfer to the collector.\n\nDM via Twitter and let's have some fun.\n\nT+C \u2013 There are no additional fees for the minting of the final design. I reserve the right to refuse any ideas that are inappropriate or unlawful. Once the collector has chosen the design I will go away and create my interpretation to the same standard as the rest of the series, with no opportunity to comment or suggest changes unless otherwise discussed. This is supposed to be fun, let's not make it a chore!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWwKBjhNq8yYbicdf4g5LHJhXM7q194TmkguGoRJkgYPD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWwKBjhNq8yYbicdf4g5LHJhXM7q194TmkguGoRJkgYPD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWwKBjhNq8yYbicdf4g5LHJhXM7q194TmkguGoRJkgYPD", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1fJPhsLG6KaA9D1BLvQHCCEjX9G6GfqYJ3"], "tags": ["skull", "skeleton", "creature", "design", "animation", "gif"], "extra": {}}
