In the forest there is a small rat named Daga, he is always angry with Daga. One day Tamaraw is trapped in the forest, and no one wants to help him because of his attitude. Then Daga saw Tamaraw and help him escape from the trap. \n\nIt reminds us that we cannot save ourselves, time will come our enemy will save us.  \n\nSource: https://www.zenrooms.com/blog/post/endangered-species-in-the-philippines/\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS7K1LfAvTnrfKtHjxLtpsFxqZUMyLhnb7e5M5K5igXwZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdkJ56U9DbkpZqYX87H5spxg9Uc6rWN7pvqxRMauQa4TK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS7K1LfAvTnrfKtHjxLtpsFxqZUMyLhnb7e5M5K5igXwZ", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZzWbwteKmwRiwE3YNMa2JufN4q1wEUUdh"], "tags": ["#cryptoartph#nftasia#collectibles#nftcollectibles#psychart#illustration#psychedelicart#astral#folklore"], "extra": {}}
