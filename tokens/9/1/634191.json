Every point on the surface is measured as x/y/z in reference to the position of the machine in one room after the other. Afterwards assembled this huge point cloud emerges with millions of individual points in it. To me this is like an intimate radiographic look at the anatomy of this old building. \nThe structure between the walls is a void (as the cloud can hardly penetrate it) while on the surfaces you can see every so little crack in the wood grown in centuries measured in sub-millimeter depth accuracy. \nAs the machine needs time to get the process done every movement is captured as  single still images at exactly the moment of interference and is thereby frozen. Thus, the seconds of movement of people whilst measuring and the weight of the building giving in to gravity only so little over hundreds of years are captured in the same image in the same instant \u2013 2 timelines.\n\nGathered with 3d scanner, processed via Leica, selection in CAD, finalized in image editing software", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTauLzH3BBQYrpAP91q3aXNjgodVv1qbwg5CKqNu1nZdR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcVBskJeiyuCfbhJ3axR3ukWEH3Rs2w71uQHfKghLp6mw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTauLzH3BBQYrpAP91q3aXNjgodVv1qbwg5CKqNu1nZdR", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1i7q5v4vqQV3PhkCQZCni7qd4VygXQC4X7"], "tags": ["bw", "architecture", "pixel", "pointcloud", "abstractart", "3dscann"], "extra": {}}
