Josephine was most known to be a performer and Artist however she was in fact a spy for the French military who would use her dancing and entertaining skills to coax information from German soldiers. Openly bisexual Frida grew fond of Josephine and the two embarked on a wildly taboo and hotly discussed   relationship. To this day the bond is shrouded in mystery but the boldness of their desire to be together is a testament to the women of the time that they both were.
