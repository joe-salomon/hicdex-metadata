The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: Two ladies solve a Rubik\u2019s puzzle together. One lady is wearing a black silk nightgown and white stockings. The other lady is dressed similarly, but with a finer fringe and womanly clothing.\u00a0In the dream, the rug is at the feet of the first lady; it is the same that she uses to sit on \nwhile gardening.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines.
