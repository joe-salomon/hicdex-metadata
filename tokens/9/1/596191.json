An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony, reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue. A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZyuCoFVRw3ZX5GzQheqR8L7ydm5gmQgHSdDMz4Nyd2kV", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmepo8whBhAu7xjKZ4P961eJ5oZcpMpGeN4Yd1UsK6r3TJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZyuCoFVRw3ZX5GzQheqR8L7ydm5gmQgHSdDMz4Nyd2kV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TwwGAsjFWcsK7G5DBYiZ7tHKrAHBcX11v"], "tags": ["illustration", "greekmythology", "sushi", "apollo", ""], "extra": {}}
