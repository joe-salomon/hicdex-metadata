The two merged in my head, and I decided to do a 90's inspired, Heroin-chic ice-queen photo set. Along came Jori @a.part_apart.art channeling some super-Courtney vibes and I knew they had to be part of this artistic project! We spoke ahead of time and they practiced their grunge attitude and then we blasted Hole and took sassy photos. Jori could not have been a more perfect model, and I am so happy with how our project turned out! Thank you to @Madone_noire for creating this insane corset which worked perfectly (and is insanely beautiful and exquisitely crafted).\n*\nModel Jori \nCorset @Madone_noire\nPhoto and Headdress @BubblesAndFrown", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPzu8zciremc6jTG3UkBxTfCYk9V5ZizqjR1MDfXUZRYh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSqGC8yR5Sn2LYkH8KYn31g2xdyvoN2WbTFXKJz8EhJBp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPzu8zciremc6jTG3UkBxTfCYk9V5ZizqjR1MDfXUZRYh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ij4fDuptsj21qW1zqr3LDCERjbbC9rGcn"], "tags": ["heroin", "heroinchic", "icequeen", "promqueen", "winter", "grunge", "fashion", "white", "90s", "courtneylove", "nirvana", "darkart", "alternative", "thegirlwiththemostcake", ""], "extra": {}}
