Meanwhile there were rumours that a starship believed to be one from the fleet of the old guardians was sighted near the twin moons of nearby Pacedonia. It became clear that the starship is one of the old guardians' accompanying frigate that was reported missing during the final Shakintara assault. On board were the infamous Phantagenians, a race of cyborgs came to rejoin the alliance.\n\nProfile: Juno is rescued from certain death after she commits suicide. After the incident, her body is more robot than human, with a life support system keeping her alive. She dons the mask of the Guardians after her suicide attempt and swears revenge on the Axis. As a cyborg, she has a more powerful blade strength giving her an edge in battle.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPgfhjTyDu1baEFDcyP1AgdcnYUFjxFfxexTA1Xf8VtiV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQTP6HeauZ4NRoqqh7PwYGdUUdL9KAjtJJKYks5ZYfNJ6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPgfhjTyDu1baEFDcyP1AgdcnYUFjxFfxexTA1Xf8VtiV", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YMe6ai849tbaf6jiLGuHP48nPHqLKc7Ay"], "tags": ["robot", "cyborg", "thebizzare", "robot", "crypto", "fantasy", "outerspace", "planet", "halo", "gun", "alien"], "extra": {}}
