While preserving texts, figures and original diagrams made with markers, I then interfer with painting that holds both the spirit of the stencil characteristic of street art and the pixelation specific to digitalization. By confronting myself with the language of marketing, I superimpose, in black or in color, other markers from nature, the tragedies of the world and other old and recent illustrations. The painting, in dripping, comes to reinforce the paradoxical link between the initial support and the painted image. The coherence between the support and the painting creates another balance to the point of not being able to dissociate the \"above\" from the \"below\".\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRmpj9JMzDJmtWGTQAemc1e9H89MqwCXpQ8yiRfyA262U", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRmpj9JMzDJmtWGTQAemc1e9H89MqwCXpQ8yiRfyA262U", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRmpj9JMzDJmtWGTQAemc1e9H89MqwCXpQ8yiRfyA262U", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QQNPFkBVS5big912uLGxY9Mg8TeZdJ9Mj"], "tags": ["art", "paperwork", "painting", "flipchart"], "extra": {}}
