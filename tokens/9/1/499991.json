The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: I\u2019m staying in a large Victorian house with a dozen or so family members. Everyone is gathered at the fire place, where flames begin to build. The place has meaning to me; it\u2019s where I began my story about what had taken place the night before. As the fire bores through the night, everyone but me, weighing their options. We decide to flee, the four of us planing an escape. How do we get out? Can we be rescued?\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 152 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmViq2iU9ujUAraxMFWd7Md6Brt98XxPaQgDHxK6Vy1wXL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVma6UktDNzPdw5UJeDYGWg6ZJ78up7EysodQxyHNRjwr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmViq2iU9ujUAraxMFWd7Md6Brt98XxPaQgDHxK6Vy1wXL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
