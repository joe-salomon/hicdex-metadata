Autobiographical abstraction. \n\nUNION pieces are what happens when BINARY and SPECTRUM pieces collide and break apart, providing a more playful canvas for the colour blocks to dance amidst the white squares and find oblique representations of the story they're expressing.\n\nTHE WIRES\n---------------------\nBehind the physical world\nis a world of wires.\nA liquid switchboard\nthat connects every thing\nto everything else.\nEach wire vibrates\nwith a different colour,\nwhich describes the\nstrength of the bond\nbetween each node. \nI once asked The Wires \nabout you but they just laughed. \nI asked why, and they told me: \n'Yes, you have an important bond \nbut really, to us, it's like asking \nif your toe ever thinks about your\nearlobe. In the end, it doesn't \nreally matter - you're both \npart of the same\nbody'.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbeTFWGGcoBCVCsqZismhoh8BuidPsKsZu4w4LtsLTGV9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbWKVBfiKgoFxP6HoedBw4duZSv5558Lg3fhBFU7Wrbey", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbeTFWGGcoBCVCsqZismhoh8BuidPsKsZu4w4LtsLTGV9", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WqiSCF73e2YK85VL2EXrgL5oti3AkJEKf"], "tags": ["literary", "abstract", "abstractexpressionism", "fineart", "abstractart", "minimalism", "minimalistart"], "extra": {}}
