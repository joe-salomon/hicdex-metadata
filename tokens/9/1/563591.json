The girl had a difficult childhood - the father beat the children, and the mother advised them to just accept. After finishing school, the girl got a job in a slaughterhouse. It was her dream job\nShe was married twice - Catherine\u2019s first husband failed to suffocate and he left. John Price had two children and knew that the girl was not well. After living with her for several years, he decided to leave her. For this, Katherine stabbed him 37 times, and burned the pieces of his body and served him like a stew to his children.\nMy model is a prototype of Catherine and all the female killers who kill as hard and as ruthless as men. Both clothes and murder have no gender.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmav1aLq4p7o5RnST1nW1k94xHzFP57zaRABWHHhwP6PoC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNZRnYEr2QZYotob15r6htu8cxiWvVegPVebYp5q39ULa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmavkgaXTjfhwJgBJjB11payz6NjvDcTNkUPoLTPhcwYBQ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmav1aLq4p7o5RnST1nW1k94xHzFP57zaRABWHHhwP6PoC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["#women#murder#women"], "extra": {}}
