Throughout my childhood, this sort of thing continued. I was forced to study for the SAT (American standardized test) 5 years ahead of schedule. Today, I've long forgotten about the sadness and anger that I felt at the time, but it still lives on in me in some ways. This is my way of telling my younger self that it got better. I still love my mom, but man was she harsh at the time.\n\nThis is a piece created using Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, and PYTTI4. It is a mixture of digital art and AI generated artwork. All the objects were inspired by the official Scantrons, and drawn using Photoshop tools.
