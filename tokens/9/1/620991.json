Chaotic but still funny in a way. Hope you enjoy it. \nThis piece is a highly textured 3000x3000px PNG, done in two colors (magenta and cyan) and drawn randomly at 3 in the morning. \nWhenever I draw these kinds of chaotic pieces I try, above all else, to have fun with the characters and let the situations take form by themselves without thinking too much about it. Eventually they start creating their own little scenes, as if they have a life of their own and I'm just putting them there.
