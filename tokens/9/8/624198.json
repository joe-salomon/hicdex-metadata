However, the question remains, just like in the rest of society: where does this money go? What do we do with all those millions earned, and why does this not go to where it\u2019s most needed. We set up a campaign where the money from NFT's is used to give back to the people in society who deserve this money.\u00a0During today's crisis, a large number of independent artists did not have enough financial resources and did not get any financial support from the government. Meanwhile, the government purchased Rembrandt's standard-bearer for 150 million euros. Through the sale of this NFT, which is accessible to everyone due to its low price, we want to raise money and give it back to these independent artists. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUJBnC7DuKWx64tWJ2UTsx5RxD97mM1niazWJrQM8q4Wf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVfZuDMR64wRTqVkP4q83EJ89uFVMdKiMQ9hNYUdRreT9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUJBnC7DuKWx64tWJ2UTsx5RxD97mM1niazWJrQM8q4Wf", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "social", "fundraiser", "crowdfunding", "goodcause", "Rembrandt"], "extra": {}}
