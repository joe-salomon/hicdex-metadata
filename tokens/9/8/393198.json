Deep inside the castle lived a cruel Assyrian king called Zahhak. His armies terrorised all the people of the land.\n\nAll had been well before Zahhak\u2019s rule in Mesopotamia.\n\nIt was during the reign of a king called Jemshid that things started to go wrong. He thought himself above the sun gods and began to lose favour with his people.\n\nA spirit called Ahriman the Evil, seized the chance to take control.
