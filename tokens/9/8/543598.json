That boy wearing something\nlike a walkman. Everything I saw its similar with 90's era.\n\nThis little girl staring at me, sometimes she's smiling but she kept staring.\nCan't tell this is a nightmare or what but I'm pretty sure I was terrified of this dream.\n\nI woke up around 3-4 AM , take a piss and drink a glass of water.\nI sit and trying to remember every second of what I've dreamt of\n\nThis artwork is all I remember.\n\n\nWeeks later, near my house, I noticed something. I can see a view with Salak mountain at the back.\nThen there's neighbor's garage. It's pretty simple-open garage with old stuff there. \n\nLong story short, I was asking my other neighbor about \"is there a small field around here sometime ago?\"\nAnd he said \"Yes, there was a small field there (pointed to the neighbor garage)\"\nThen he added \"back then kids used to play at that small field.\"\n\n\nHmm, okay.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaMimrFjzs1iGRFVhK8xQ58aNvXwN3pwsKV4Ftw3Q5db7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUTwkh9DK7BV84uAvvVfhGBvoUy2TYnJzwME56bbWbf53", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaMimrFjzs1iGRFVhK8xQ58aNvXwN3pwsKV4Ftw3Q5db7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VAsGtkiMKS6J7rJFvHgLpwC2tdTWM9SMX"], "tags": ["dream", "weird", "creepy", "horror", "neighborhood", "playground", "dawn"], "extra": {}}
