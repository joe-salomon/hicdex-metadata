{"__version": 1, "token_id": 556698, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Gardener and Death", "description": "This NFT is titled 'The Gardener and Death' and is my take on the famous poem by Dutch poet P.N. van Eyck ( 1887-1954 ). The original title of the poem is 'De tuinman en de dood' and it's about a nobleman, his gardener and his encounter with death. The translation of the poem goes something like this: A Persian Nobleman: Early this morn, pale with fright, my gardener hastened into my home and cried: \u2018Sir, sir, one moment, please! Down in the rosary, pruning roses with care, I turned to look behind me. Death stood there. I took great fright, and made haste along the other side, but still I caught the threatening gesture of his hand. 'Master, your horse! And let me try to get away. Before the evening in Isfahan I will stay !\u2019- This afternoon (he'd long since had gone his way) I came across Death down yonder in the cedar glade. \u2018Why', I ask, because he stands and waits forlorn, 'Did you came to threaten my gardener this morn'?' Smiling he answers: 'No threat it was, wherefore your gardener fled, I was surprised, That morning here to see still working the man, I was to fetch that night in Isfahan.' \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRfJoQB9Qx8zTfyHETRCd8A46hJf1i6xy1niKaLkeitqG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYjdxJBbEPQcSf3nPfk6kG41quSwuJWigN25YwMgUCJvW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRfJoQB9Qx8zTfyHETRCd8A46hJf1i6xy1niKaLkeitqG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QFL8FGwkz7stGs1PPpHvwCrgpy9PsXd3N"], "tags": ["painting", "poetry", "rey", "reylarsdam"], "extra": {}}
