Akabeko is a legendary cow that is believed to be able to ward off illnesses. In Indonesia, farmer's boy usually rides on a cow while tending on their rice fields. So i combined both in a drawing, with a hope that we can go through this year safely and in good health. This will be a personal memento for me too, of these weird 2020-2021 :)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXRp1sQGHkFv4ZhhCuPBwq91tn5eBaUFVmnWQETDhxGVr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNhE8xraXN4YPcXk1DeUisi6z7MPRE4XhNgT4avoWBzhe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXRp1sQGHkFv4ZhhCuPBwq91tn5eBaUFVmnWQETDhxGVr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PjNLh96Lvod5SqAnQMcSCZgMQucSdn99n"], "tags": ["akabeko", "omamori", "charm", "bali", "japan", "ricefield", "Indonesia", "cecilliahidayat"], "extra": {}}
