One deals with the horror of the act of a child killing their own father and the other is in regards to the care and medical treatment of children. One about death, the other about life. One about brutality, an animalistic aspect of our human condition, the other about the relentless pursuit of protecting and healing our children. This is who we are. We have limbs of construction and limbs of destruction.
