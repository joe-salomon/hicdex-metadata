(Yup, that's what I thought...all hands are unanimously up in the air.) Ninjas were highly trained Japanese mercenary agents hired for covert operations such as assassination and sabotage using incredible martial arts skills. Ever since I was a child I've been interested in Japanese culture and history. The work you see is a visual illustration the word NINJA. The look and feel from the repetition of the word ninja give the sense of rapid bursts of kinetic movement as if to insinuate a ninja running or jumping from point a to point b. All I have to say is we need more Ninjas in art. Well, not actual ninjas, as I wouldn't want anyone assassinated or art shows sabotaged per se; more of the subject matter in art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUUhuvbBqaPJz1QXe32caAJgxvzhW8TV1fREDgAUptHDX", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc9mVDCbTU4E4uSyFiFYvrG3nZ3vjeWJQtGX1RUcoQsdK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUUhuvbBqaPJz1QXe32caAJgxvzhW8TV1fREDgAUptHDX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
