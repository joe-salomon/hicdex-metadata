{"__version": 1, "token_id": 633498, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MONEY THEY DON'T HAVE ON THINGS THEY DON'T NEED.", "description": "For years, the comedic work from George Carlin, has been a guidebook of where the landmines in my life could/would/should be. When I was younger, I just thought his work was funny on the surface, but as I am getting older, there is an intense layer of wisdom and life lessons to be learned. His jokes were actually astute observations on the reality of politics, society, America, humanity and so much more. In one of his HBO specials, he said the following: \"MONEY THEY DON'T HAVE ON THINGS THEY DON'T NEED.\" He was referring to how American Capitalism creates an extreme version of consumer culture, where if there's something new, you need it immediately and screw the consequences. I used to be trapped by this feeling or innate desire in regards to the the culture. I have since changed my outlook and focus in life. I no longer desire most materialistic things and discovered true purpose for my life in the process. Money is an unfortunate necessity as part of our lives, but it shouldn't be something that defines us or who we are. So the next time you see that watch, shoes, cars, etc...say to yourself, \"Do I truly need this or do I just want it?\" When you add this filter to your life, life can become less complicated to a certain degree.
