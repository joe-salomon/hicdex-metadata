This spirit once called upon is able to change the landscapes the summoner is in to help guide those to the path they chose but may have become lost. Called upon too often and this spirit will begin to play tricks on the summoner, leading them astray from their path and towards their end. Follow its changed path it has bestowed upon you and nothing evil will come to the one who holds this spirit.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQwMYkbAAbwuW3RQbrGuTAgc7tksmRSP6wXspUFsv2aop", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWdpn6QN3rbnLBoAVzkZnDkpgGFMRWsaPMzmg8hwDbv2G", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNQaPfCMLQ1tvgVBRGjkpwCebmPCd5yjEb6hJG9Z9XNNr", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQwMYkbAAbwuW3RQbrGuTAgc7tksmRSP6wXspUFsv2aop", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YPLmM3SjL2LjeLxbFPhpraWwGcTiijvhv"], "tags": ["digital"], "extra": {}}
