The only issue is the cold. I was also trying to get more into City images. Shooting in the parks was fun but it is so close to landscapes that it felt like I needed to push myself out of my comfort zone a bit and try doing more of something I am not so practiced at. This is an iconic street in midtown. I am looking from a bridge on the east side of Manhattan looking all the way down 42nd Street. I hope you enjoy the view as much as I did waiting for the light to be just right!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeXPFm4ojE6g8XRjqKMUppiD7qv6SxvC1nk3JiAdZcY59", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRqeUsFSJQEnaq1FkdY6DksuUesr3np5YoKYUJPET6mB3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeXPFm4ojE6g8XRjqKMUppiD7qv6SxvC1nk3JiAdZcY59", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dT1cPF73Cc51o9pu9CCMiyz9AbmT71Fgs"], "tags": ["Newyork", "42ndst", "sunset", ""], "extra": {}}
