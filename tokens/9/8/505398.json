{"__version": 1, "token_id": 505398, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Angelcat and Friends Collection - Barry Bear", "description": "Angel Cat and Friends is about Cheonsa the Cat, an angel cat sent to earth to help fellow animals do good deeds. To disguise herself and do her mission, Cheonsa runs Coffee Cat, a caf\u00e9 that caters to all animals in town. Her most frequent customers are Danny Dog, Rita Rabbit, Paulie Penguin, Chase Chick, Owen Owl and Barry Bear. Each of them has his/her own likes and dislikes as well as good and bad traits. With her yummy food and drinks, little pieces of advice and some help with their needs, Cheonsa inspires them to become better versions of themselves. This NFT is one of Cheonsa's friends and caf\u00e9 customers, Barry Bear.\n\nBarry Bear is a lazy detective who often drops by the caf\u00e9 when he feels he has nothing better to do. He is strong but a bit cowardly. He likes cute things. He gets really angry when his weight is being mentioned, but he has a soft heart and shows much kindness to others.
