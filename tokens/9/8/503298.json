The discomfort caused by the mirroring of the Congresso Nacional in the Esplanada dos Ministerios makes an allusion to the unbalanced political scenario of Brazil. \n\nThe famous building was planned by Oscar Niemeyer and became a symbol of the distrust in politics and also of the systematic corruption in the country.\n\nThis piece discusses issues regarding the erasure of female narratives, especially of black women in the Brazilian context. It also alludes to the sterypzation of indigenous people and the lack of understanding regarding other subjectivities and cultures that also encompass the rich Brazilian identity quilt.\n\nIn this piece, there is a desire for the political space to be more inclusive and representative of the Brazilian complex society formation, so crucial agendas can be  perceived as crutial in the development of individuals and the country itself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYBYvNk7t8nWiHqfekgG1Qb3UEuGbeD94szAmLa55GENw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRgNqtYSqmDJYTsjtMuyL4xz4XRJNs1ZTKhDRy2aSRKB8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYBYvNk7t8nWiHqfekgG1Qb3UEuGbeD94szAmLa55GENw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eoHcb3MpXZ9uJMZwQpAQ1wfmzAWuiGSSP"], "tags": ["brazil", "indigenous", "feminism", "brazilianartist", "collage", "political", "resistance"], "extra": {}}
