There was one week, while living with Julia Yerger and Jeffrey Alan Scudder, that we weren't able to leave the house due to air quality concerns: Ashland was measuring over 400 on the Air Quality Index of AirNow.gov. We were painting on our computers and on Jeffrey's iPad. That was the week I made this painting.
