Nazar is an important notion in Anatolia, the idea of the evil-eye. A few things are particularly at risk of \u201cnazar\u201d (or unspecified evil) happening to them. Vulnerable, and valuable people (particularly babies) are at risk, pets, important objects in the home, property, or other inanimate objects, or really, in general, any somewhat unfortunate thing happening. The primary way to prevent the evil eye from striking you or your family is through \u201cnazarl\u0131k,\u201d either evil-eye beads or evil eye motifs.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW97TjutPkizWCad1L2XRkseRm1QJQJU61qF81Y6DT85z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfKHLxnegF5fCtYovwR7matdCjmFsWyJjb8pVGhFKdDmp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW97TjutPkizWCad1L2XRkseRm1QJQJU61qF81Y6DT85z", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iDQED34wbhZ68JapwSW1UhwPvwREP7u3E"], "tags": ["3d", "music", "dance", "abstract", "glass", "edition"], "extra": {}}
