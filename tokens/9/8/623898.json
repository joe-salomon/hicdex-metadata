White Frame", "description": "Traumatized by bullying as a child and betrayed by his family whom he trusted, Alexander became one of the most evil and cunning individual demons on the planet. He was originally a student of Saint Monica\u2019s Religious School, his years of abuse enabled his mind to become corrupted. Seizing up the opportunity, Lucifer himself struck a deal with him to give his life purpose by turning him into a demon.\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied. White frames of Demon Boy: Alexander will be initially exclusively as gifts and giveaways on Twitter and Discord and all artworks will be compatible within the Gallery Gehenna Mobile Game with each artwork unlocking a playable segment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdMLCUncrPotEaKJnmtLAb6RdBy3z8bi6Hoh9h83ZVWeo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNewaP9FgporerFFRFrXrWCG36NdVisCNcwwgW79wSD22", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdMLCUncrPotEaKJnmtLAb6RdBy3z8bi6Hoh9h83ZVWeo", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2KTcdaM1hm8d8K9pnBu6dsD6v38bjyXDAP"], "tags": ["GalleryGehennaProject", "GalleryGehenna", "GehennaProject", "Demon", "DemonKid", "NeuralNetwork", "NeuralNetworkArt", "Hell", "Darkart", "Creepyart", ""], "extra": {}}
