I spent the day  playing board games with my daughter, watching kids shows and then probably the last Christmas movie of the season. Her and my wife fell asleep on the couch and I stole off to my studio to work on this very design. May not appear to be much of a day but I'd slide exit stage left through 2022 with this routine. Just over 3 months in and we're gaining some great momentum, just need to keep feeding the fire into the new year!
