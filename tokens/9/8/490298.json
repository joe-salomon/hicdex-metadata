Fortunately, Basher was born with superhuman strength, so he can pretty much just thump people to get the job done.\n\nThe angrier Basher gets, the stronger he becomes. That means that his teammates have to keep him in a perpetual state of rage to get the most out of him, which they do by poking him, taunting him, pinching his horns, making fun of his purple complexion and reading him online reviews of hammers he must love from afar but never wield himself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcLLQgxsv3RDxZA2Q5M85cKkST28eRCcoNxJAJrFXzZhH", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf3o5r9G9G74HWcRiMwtrWV3TmezpqrXCUXyuUaxmLh2G", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcLLQgxsv3RDxZA2Q5M85cKkST28eRCcoNxJAJrFXzZhH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["Vessels"], "extra": {}}
