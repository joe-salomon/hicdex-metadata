Have always loved exploring soundscapes and this comes as a beautiful way of sharing alongside my visual Journey. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPXAo8pmePxN888ceW8QS35pkVWSgiXk7BgP3afMmXqML", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUnzSHcz3pnRhKndvANRf3YqCwX61PYWiH2QETgvwxfEW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPXAo8pmePxN888ceW8QS35pkVWSgiXk7BgP3afMmXqML", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XuKcWuDT9AXhnoGaFVpcU4obiY65xtpg3"], "tags": ["abstract", "animation", "digitalpainting", "eyes", "illustration", "lion", "love", "nature", "psychedelic", "rare", "superrare", "surreal", "surrealism", "vision"], "extra": {}}
