Some days we need some encouragement/motivation. It can come from anywhere, but initiatives to motivate the art community are always welcome!\n36 Days of Type is an excellent example of these initiatives, it's a project that invites designers, illustrators and artists to express their particular interpretation of the letters and numbers of the Latin alphabet. I already participated in other editions, but I had never taken the right time for it until this 2021 edition. I started 2121 with the idea of creating something every day and try to motivate my followers to keep practicing calligraphy and lettering. So, when 36Days started, I did not doubt that I should create something tremendous and mix it with my \"Whole year practicing\" project.\nSo, this is the result, 36 unique characters minted. Each letter was created using three layers of information and three calligraphy styles, one above each other.\nI'm launching here this limited edition of 36 posters of the entire alphabet. Hope you like it :)\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfBf3dbNdWooABb9UkwgNCXrz6J2ezgxunUAAZTqU2TTW", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf3jufLctt7Ay83tUgT2Ac8A688iK41w31zd2L5j3rFbG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfBf3dbNdWooABb9UkwgNCXrz6J2ezgxunUAAZTqU2TTW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aq1sA8khJwUCfu34wRnm9U8Wq7btS98Su"], "tags": ["calligraphy", "lettering", "alphabet", "36daysoftype", "36daysofpracticing"], "extra": {}}
