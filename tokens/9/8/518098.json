But years passed like every one of us, she slowly forgot about her childhood dream. One day she woke up freezing in the middle of the night and saw her little room filled with pink clouds. She looked above and saw something shining. She couldn't believe herself. She saw the moon glimmering in the dark blue sky. It fell into her arms as she reached for it slowly. As the moon shone in her little hands she realized her long lost childhood dream. \n\nMade for the little big broken childhood dreams.\n\nDuration: 28sec(with sound)\n1080\u00d71328\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb3hhSYjudVcNBMvs1xmKhG4LySohDzztrzQmewCFBzRT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTp1LAPxGgdDC4C6zpjPBvVuFRa9g82rNCWCPTYwUbgKg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb3hhSYjudVcNBMvs1xmKhG4LySohDzztrzQmewCFBzRT", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2MsPvLKFjitWQFbvKdCKjyJCzfPS6nfGNK"], "tags": ["art", "animation", "video", "objkt", "artist", "artwork", "collectible", "nft"], "extra": {}}
