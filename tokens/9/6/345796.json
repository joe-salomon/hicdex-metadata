An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.\n\"Generative art\" often refers to algorithmic art (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork) and synthetic media (general term for any algorithmically-generated media), but artists can also make it using systems of chemistry, biology, mechanics and robotics, smart materials, manual randomization, mathematics, data mapping, symmetry, tiling, and more.\nThe first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled \"Generative Computergrafik\".While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was \"computer-grafik\".\"Generative art\" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including Manfred Mohr.Vera Moln\u00e1r (born 1924) is a French media artist of Hungarian origin. Molnar is widely considered to be a pioneer of generative art, and is also one of the first women to use computers in her art practice. The term \"Generative Art\" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the \"Generative Art\" conference in Milan in 1998.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQVngM9qGwNZw7VC3jnk35EWeZQfPNEtz5VZvJMZwQqC8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTuNe5jq2xEKfmgUhi57UWSjYkTqEYNZNrSzHEr4V5Nnh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQVngM9qGwNZw7VC3jnk35EWeZQfPNEtz5VZvJMZwQqC8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1byfv1EckZBdrd9Z3CVp6nY8W7WRYWf6qn"], "tags": ["object4objekt", "generativeart", "procedural", "computerart", "coding", "genartclub", "proceduralart", "artandtechnology", "generative", "pixels", "rare", "newmediaart", "mathart", "creativecodeart", "opticalart", "audiovisual", "algorithmicart", "artxcode", "creativecoding", "processing", "touchdesigner", "geometricart", "persian", "pyton", "psychedelic", "generativedesign", "abstract", "minimal", "pattern", "bhfyp", "geomatic", "trippy", "shahrokh", "noise", "psychedelicart", "pixelart", "geometry", "codeart", "aiart", "carpet", "p5js", "isometric", "opart", "glsl", "hen200k"], "extra": {}}
