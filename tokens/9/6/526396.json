It begins at lower intensities as a gradual distortion of an object's texture which causes them to subtly droop, wobble, and lose their structural integrity. This gradually increases until it becomes impossible to ignore as the lines, textures, and colour between solid objects melt into one another in an extremely fluid style. https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting\n\n///////////////////////////////////////\n\n\"hehhhhhhhh ur face looks so weird\"\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNhfZA8TAphU8Z2qu29uQKR9pajbMZW1PoxBbAp9GHqzM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNhfZA8TAphU8Z2qu29uQKR9pajbMZW1PoxBbAp9GHqzM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNhfZA8TAphU8Z2qu29uQKR9pajbMZW1PoxBbAp9GHqzM", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2EA84awhkCYQeDQoKkGMkVotyBQzSHKPDQ"], "tags": ["animated", "gif", "anime", "drugs", "kawaii", "neuroram", "glitch", "melting"], "extra": {}}
