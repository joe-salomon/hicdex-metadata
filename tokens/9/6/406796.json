THIS WHOLE SERIES all started with the same exact photo as a base and that photo was a drawing of Unicorns and Mermaids by my good friend @EaEAa10.  Another friend and I had the idea to use her drawings to make new computer assisted artworks and she was al in!  THIS NFT is also a drop and burn.  I will drop 200 copies and give people a few hours to collect as many as they like and then burn the rest, well before the end of the day.  So we shall see how much Mermaid Magic survives the burn!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVL3ufg3tDYZ27drCpp6H3H1kpWrv5odxr5GrCJbWmGSo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZSzuUtjGroEn6B4WC6nqVVBjF577uerG1LqBjrYHeVJb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVL3ufg3tDYZ27drCpp6H3H1kpWrv5odxr5GrCJbWmGSo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ZfApCB1rmfyByn9e1jj1w9jLSY1wfu9dm"], "tags": ["quilt", "move", "movement", "color", "colors", "colorful", "animation", "green", "motion", "pattern", "bold", "zoom"], "extra": {}}
