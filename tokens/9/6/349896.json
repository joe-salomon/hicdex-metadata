Noise is taken from circular motion on a 2D noise field with its own radius and offset. These values are mapped onto a range of colours according to one of seven different algorithms, and rotation is added to produce interference patterns with a choice from eight rendering modes.\nThe initial seed for this loop of 120 frames is 859793, which selects function 1 with offset (-8.0, -2.0), range (0.7000035, 0.39999604), and function 3 with offset (-28.0, -61.0), range (0.6, -10.500007). Noise is produced from sampling points on an ellipse at co-ordinates (88.0, 11.0) with diameters (1.6000009, 0.4000006). The three formulae are combined using algorithm 5 with hue values starting at 321 with range 305. The grid is 101 units square.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTYcCY1ZeYud2GCSd3Fz9w7XVq5r9PKGcpkUW24B7jAR2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTYcCY1ZeYud2GCSd3Fz9w7XVq5r9PKGcpkUW24B7jAR2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTYcCY1ZeYud2GCSd3Fz9w7XVq5r9PKGcpkUW24B7jAR2", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VjCS2jiBTVPSEoYzJ79KkbYV5QbFJxuf3"], "tags": ["xisal", "noise", "loop", "processing", "grid", "859793"], "extra": {}}
