With trying to make /burnedbyairfryer have a more surreal themed foundation & /fiasco9.0 being more digitally manipulated abstractions..I wanted to create a collage series where I attempt to be more experimental with the placement of assets with very little edits to them...kind of wanting to replicate a more minimal & analog look with a fun problem solving / loose puzzle piecing creative experience. Maybe breaking rules here and there, but definitely wanting to just bring highlight to the the combination of assets themselves, rather than a conceptualized piece. Also I really really need to practice simplicity...Even in this practice it's hard to contain, I'm just always seeing for what can be added. /goneyharlic is just about loosely being what it is..An experimental digital collage through my eyes and vibes at that moment. Also been working more on 1/1s with the other collections, but I decided for this series to be more widely available as a thank you for any collectors accepting this personal aesthetic.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmetcX1C3Uiu2Sf2TB2QdLvk9ZrNNfoc4FE2RS1gKXJkKv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTLwLwftY7nu4RvefJRfTRtKyNfoG6BUUB5KCzpMaw7B1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmetcX1C3Uiu2Sf2TB2QdLvk9ZrNNfoc4FE2RS1gKXJkKv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["digital", "collage", "art", "experimental", "back", "to", "roots", "goneyharlic", "no5ay_"], "extra": {}}
