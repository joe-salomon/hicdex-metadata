It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to find and enhance patterns in images by over processing them. It was originally designed to automatically classify images, by detecting faces and other patterns in them, but it was discovered that if this process was reversed (the neural network weights are held fixed and the input is adjusted), it could generate psychedelic and surreal results.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbzkeWmwWqFJqSkobpiSz2TuqcDboFD26z8jEycoiGX69", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUB3YgZLPGMtirCXKX1vf2JTJdLWSzCeGya7RABTEaqHL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbzkeWmwWqFJqSkobpiSz2TuqcDboFD26z8jEycoiGX69", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fsjPmgukJ28x1NPV3P27gYHr2uBso4Tdf"], "tags": ["ArtificialIntelligence", "AI", "art", "Dreams", "3D", "Rainbow"], "extra": {}}
