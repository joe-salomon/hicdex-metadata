Gray outside the window means bad weather and you can sit at home with a cup of cocoa and a movie. Gray represents calm, neutrality, stability. This color is thought to have a relaxing effect on the psyche, helping to organize thoughts. I like gray in the autumn.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRJojuHpKmfHYnx8W7uWqYvsLB49tjFnN2EvqTVDKvbHZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXTepf5Fc88y1fqAhGmATzdKs3fa1FB32EL1V96Y7Ts9X", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRJojuHpKmfHYnx8W7uWqYvsLB49tjFnN2EvqTVDKvbHZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["gray", "autumn"], "extra": {}}
