{"__version": 1, "token_id": 548296, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Antisocial Personality", "description": "People with this personality disorder have difficulty empathizing. They tend not to be able to think about what other people think or are indifferent to other people's perceptions of themselves. They find it difficult to feel other people's feelings (especially animals) so they don't have any feelings when hurting animals or other people. So it seems like it's indifferent to want the animal to feel pain or whatever.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdMZG6HWEnrVtPoFu8K28FWQPV9PJxsximLKQJsyawCCc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmajSBi2W4i9kPp38ECqWZ2n36itxmsawb28Cyosnncw3x", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdMZG6HWEnrVtPoFu8K28FWQPV9PJxsximLKQJsyawCCc", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LcXxcG8wGjnaRxZj6raCo5jmCm44JRwQT"], "tags": ["QLC", "mentalhealth", "mentalilness", "disorder", "animal", "cat", "cute", "zuverse"], "extra": {}}
