She is the feminine counterpart of the bodhisattva (\u201cbuddha-to-be\u201d) Avalokiteshvara. According to popular belief, she came into existence from a tear of Avalokiteshvara, which fell to the ground and formed a lake. Out of its waters rose up a lotus, which, on opening, revealed the goddess. Like Avalokiteshvara, she is a compassionate, succouring deity who helps men \u201ccross to the other shore.\u201d She is the protectress of navigation and earthly travel, as well as of spiritual travel along the path to enlightenment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYqueEhUXWhyJspxeFdDPgCFa5d7JGt9DZSnKw6967rUT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbLWjCXGyJokBFgtgim3zchmdDwBKTxZFS9eBuAgAnu1e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYqueEhUXWhyJspxeFdDPgCFa5d7JGt9DZSnKw6967rUT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iJ8RSnZx2DHWFrUrkSTrehGbtjU8paCqG"], "tags": ["psychedelic", "sgrol-ma", "tara", "buddhism", "buddhistgoddess", "boddhitsava", "goddess", "buddha", "painting", "procreate", "illustration", "digitalpainting", "painting"], "extra": {}}
