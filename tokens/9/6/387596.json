This design is based on a grid with a square base.\n\nThis is made with Nodebox, a node-based visual language for generative art. All artworks are unique: based on a random seed value. This is #888195.\n\nThis is a \u2018plottable artwork\u2019. Which means it can be drawn by a machine: a pen plotter. I am happy to deliver a physical drawing after purchase (international shipping included).
