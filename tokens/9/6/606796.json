Each one was minted on the hic et nunc contract on H=N or a mirror site. \n\nThis Insert commemorates those 200 mints. It was originally made available for free via airdrop to every verified member of The Grotto at the time it was minted.  It is a special token of thanks for all the interest and engagement and support The Grotto has provided me this year.\n\nThe first 200 Tezos mints produced 81,757 total editions. At the time of this writing, 37,416 of those editions have been burned for Utility.  Those of you who receive this token will have to figure out its Utility and decide for yourselves what to do with it.\n\n\n\n******** digital capture of original painting, gouache on vintage baseball card, 2021. ************ NFT image is for personal use, no commercial rights are granted.
