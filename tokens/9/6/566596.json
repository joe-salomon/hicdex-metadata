My mornings have become unbearable and the burden of living makes the act of waking up   quite a task. All the traumatic memories of my past seem to dance in a circle around me throughout the day and I constantly try to find some sense before I self destruct.\n\nI wonder how do the people around me do this life thing? Maybe they have engaged themselves in a rewards program so that they always have something to look forward to, something to serve as a treat for being a good boy/girl. Maybe its a night out at the club on the weekend, a road trip or some time with friends and family that they look forward to. But me? I feel I have nothing to look forward to and I always ask myself, how the fxck did this happen?\n\nPerhaps I took life for granted or the other way around and now I only find refuge in indifference. I feel like a stranger in my own body, burning in the flames of my apathy!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU1snxS51NVQWyiHsN6KgaYtCrU486TUnPE4RtY3TsYuu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcUXTqHRbWmVgPEE3WXD2QhjxRxDAokr1gyfbNQYc5NUt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmSXcKN4FcKS5dEqRWqEG2kYicroRJFBwrefKLgiLDB4Yd", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU1snxS51NVQWyiHsN6KgaYtCrU486TUnPE4RtY3TsYuu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2SkdBBW7iQr9MGriz7P1QcBu95RKM8ueWo"], "tags": ["art", "digital", "painting", "2d"], "extra": {}}
