We all know the sun, this is it but in textual form. It's now October and lately we haven't seen much of the sun in recent days, so this was created to cheer me up (it may help others as well).\n\nProduced from my personal capture on a mobile phone. Preprocessed frames into smaller images with an Amstrad CPC color palette, dithered with a hard, vertical algorithm. Passed into a custom graphics device where the screen is divided into character cells (using the Galaksija computer\u2019s character set from 1983).\n\nAnimated GIF\n632x624, 24 fps, 10s", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTwJiZ4uwyijQn5N25SGtWz7U9rNBmworAA28Ab4KdqZU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTwJiZ4uwyijQn5N25SGtWz7U9rNBmworAA28Ab4KdqZU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTwJiZ4uwyijQn5N25SGtWz7U9rNBmworAA28Ab4KdqZU", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1THMezT7jXsbHeyX7NwQWnUAwxRd3BtYmy"], "tags": ["sun", "text", "vintage", "computer", "amstrad", "Galaksija", "gif", "looping", "bright"], "extra": {}}
