I haven't found the will to do anything but paint and draw, and as my birthday draws nearer, I feel I don't deserve to celebrate anything.\n\nI have to continue to work hard at a corporate job and put my dreams on hold, for it gives me the money to continue the things that bring me joy, and provide support for me and my loved ones.\n\nI have to remember to eat and sleep early, because I am sick with an incurable disease, and at any moment, I feel as though I could die, and the constant thought of it is making it harder to eat or sleep early.\n\nI have to choose between seeing my parents and my sister, and putting them at risk, or staying at home, for they have made their choice to see me and put themselves at risk, and I miss them a lot.\n\n- Kim Ong", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNQtWQRr4duMB2aDFcbYM7936NcsMRSTHtyoN6pEWPNtq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUYBzwLCYcrhvStWFTrSTrg7vEozeWjAAfcZc1Mi27aAq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNQtWQRr4duMB2aDFcbYM7936NcsMRSTHtyoN6pEWPNtq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1L8y5Y6xp4YsPATJxeXVzbAEXvfyY8Xu9F"], "tags": ["contemporary", "digitalpainting", "expressionism", "surrealism", "nftasia", "objkt", "painting", "clubeuphorianft"], "extra": {}}
