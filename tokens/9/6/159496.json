The \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d messaging inspired me to create a 1970\u2019s TV dinner packaging motif. Cock-full of hidden messages, the humor focuses on the force- feeding of thoughts that made the public choke during the Trump reign. Racism, alien migration, the wall, travel bans, election fraud and the countless members of the Trump entourage that perpetuated his deceit. On the lighter side, you get a free print of the artwork. 11x14 full color, included with purchase.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUJu6zhmFosnsNJAEECuZ8hVXjTGn3Ajv9pmTiMNQ8Ntw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZdpvKEVfCKFcp9pvXQYaa6e3yJvgpoWxLEnda7SxcpVo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUJu6zhmFosnsNJAEECuZ8hVXjTGn3Ajv9pmTiMNQ8Ntw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QRsr5GHNYqnLdoZgBeng41vfNR2ZZwbKy"], "tags": ["popart", "reality", "dinner", "politics", "satire", "painting", "drone", "handmade", "modern", "art", ""], "extra": {}}
