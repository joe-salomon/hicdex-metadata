You use my name as if I spent my entire day sitting on your shoulders, forcing you to commit acts you would otherwise find repulsive. \"The Devil made me do it.\" I never made any one of you do anything. That is your own doing. I introduced free will yet you began to cultivate it into sin and empower it thereby becoming your own demons. A fact that I tried to prove to my Father and siblings. And yet I was cast out, stripped of my power, and to be burned in the Abyss for eternity... All because I was right.\"\n\n- Lucifer\n\n\nLucifer (or Lucifer Morningstar), formerly known as Helel, also known as Satan, the Devil, Light Bringer, the Light Bearer, and the Morning Star, was one of the earliest of God's creations, and the twin brother of Michael. He was regarded as the wisest, greatest and most beautiful angel in all of creation having virtually no equal with only God being his superior.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNhZ5oGkyEKhEtVCSDKB53FUZiY7ePu3ZDTU9ownKUgjk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTtXC7VZ2SWVxKC1AXa3kp8PgqEezpMu1oPvG5LZLKU7t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNhZ5oGkyEKhEtVCSDKB53FUZiY7ePu3ZDTU9ownKUgjk", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1cY5u6TUBth4mRSYhpW1PNBAf6VBYjZbTd"], "tags": ["digitalart", "vqgan", "darkart", "monochrome"], "extra": {}}
