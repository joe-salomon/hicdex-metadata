It's from the creator of 'Easy A' and 'Friends with Benefits'. Yep, fired up is in way below them in any manner. The script is the most amazingly witty. Humour is a persistent element in the movie (it's there all throughout the movie). Watch and you will love it.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRboZMitcAiLLP33fr9UxH1ZvcgcuTfZ31gmN7CHHMYMi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRboZMitcAiLLP33fr9UxH1ZvcgcuTfZ31gmN7CHHMYMi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRboZMitcAiLLP33fr9UxH1ZvcgcuTfZ31gmN7CHHMYMi", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1b4UhwsKz9fGSYTWCjtuc7ezxv4YsCGG5U"], "tags": ["riskybusiness", "entropic", "entrippy"], "extra": {}}
