He preserves all creations and remembers all that has ever been and all that is. He is the protector of The Quran and vowed to safe guard it from being changed or perverted as was the case with previous scriptures.\n\nBut if they turn away, [say], \u201cI have already conveyed that with which I was sent to you. My Lord will give succession to a people other than you, and you will not harm Him at all. Indeed my Lord is, over all things, Guardian.\u201d (Quran 11:57)\n\nAnd he had over them no authority except [it was decreed] that We might make evident who believes in the Hereafter from who is thereof in doubt. And your Lord, over all things, is Guardian. (Quran 34:21)\n\nAnd those who take as allies other than Him \u2013 Allah is [yet] Guardian over them; and you, [O Muhammad], are not over them a manager.
