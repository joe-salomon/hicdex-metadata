Part of my work as an artist is to try to understand the relationship between image and imagination and how they shape our world. In the Agate series, I continue my academic research on generative art, which has been inspired by hundreds, if not thousands, of different sorts of agates. With their swirls of color bands, they evoke awe and fascination. I hope these images have the same effect on you.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNRG5aPYN36X4q1rffzD1X8roZiUj7efkVqnuap8VxWkx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNmeA9tsxoFoG3iePZfAC9pWKMV2ejtABK57oJLBmKnQ1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZoZEMn4iesDjTH2s9PfJ2rpnPaDjczBDEV4pvaDaySaW", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNRG5aPYN36X4q1rffzD1X8roZiUj7efkVqnuap8VxWkx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hAU9PCAk9kEawxBufqjzQt41z1n6uEEoa"], "tags": ["digitalart", "free", "hicetnunc", "abstract", "generativeart", "objkt", "digital", "nftcollectors", "procedural"], "extra": {}}
