This eviction involves various government officials as a \"safeguard\" so that the process runs smoothly.\n\nSeeing that happen, instantly brought me to a childhood memory when I experienced a similar incident. This brought a deep sense of trauma to my life and that of my family.\nReflecting on this experience, the emotional bond between me and the eviction victims was very strong. Because I know, difficult times do not end here, but will burden us while we are still alive, both psychologically, socially and economically.\n\nHome, where we return to 'home' has now been destroyed. No more comfort, happiness, and pleasure. There are only hard times, thinking about how to survive in a situation like this.\n\nThat's why I created the \u201cRelikui Asa\u201d project to reflect on my trauma and to provide moral support to survive in difficult times.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNynnYMs2V4DYVNPvZGamv25navGouTDtusW1ymwB7ReP", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmbj66WNwyjfcsf5if41pjxwCHQLyu1oaA3YydY5dJfKtN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNynnYMs2V4DYVNPvZGamv25navGouTDtusW1ymwB7ReP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28f36EsUqgfUBVUvBq5KsmSWRqdrfD8mnC"], "tags": ["clock", "dead", "photography", "blacknwhite", "broken"], "extra": {}}
