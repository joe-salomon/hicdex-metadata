The images of this collection are elaborated by compacting components of space, time and intention. The algorithm generate images by crushing cinematographic works. The generated image, a residual trace of time, synthesizes in a colorful atmosphere the history of the original movie. The process, like the mining of some crypto assets, need a long time of computer calculation and it's value can also be indexed on electrical energy.\n\nThis image is the residual trace of the movie \"Blade Runner 2049\" by Denis Villeneuve in 2017.\n\nImage properties: 6000x2500 px, 150dpi, .png, printable\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNcUquc1fYLEy97qGz6NxgxLNfHUgGrVeNvhRiX2q996g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVLHP4fCMcT42fJaVnm7NLfGavVy5onyPBz7ro7J3iu4v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNcUquc1fYLEy97qGz6NxgxLNfHUgGrVeNvhRiX2q996g", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SzTsJNtuHjitQqchKko1n18o3NBVnCpGk"], "tags": ["color", "algorithm", "generate", "image", "remix", "movie", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
