The Egyptian\u2019s impression should be one of an active, colorful cat of medium size with well-developed muscles.\n\nWhile some people might at first be attracted to the Egyptian Mau\u2019s beautiful spotted coat, most become fans due to the breed\u2019s temperament and personality. Maus, like their ancestors that were invited along on the duck hunts of their Egyptian companions, love to fetch. While not overly talkative, Maus will let their humans know if something is amiss, particularly if that something concerns food dishes. Their voices are usually melodious and quiet.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYx1gNRAixjQsCb9EqZijsoFhaXVkH3G66SKhmLBTMA1A", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYx1gNRAixjQsCb9EqZijsoFhaXVkH3G66SKhmLBTMA1A", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYx1gNRAixjQsCb9EqZijsoFhaXVkH3G66SKhmLBTMA1A", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["pixelart", "cat", "pet", "animal", "objkt4objkt", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
