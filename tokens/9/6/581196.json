This was taken on my first visit to San Francisco. As an admirer of the Beat Generation I'd spent the morning at City Lights Book Store, time drifted and I spent the rest of the day going from bar to cafe around town, retracing the possible steps of Kerouac or Ginsberg. Starting at Vesuvio Cafe & later Specs, ending up at a Blues joint called The Saloon at 1232 Grant Street, North Beach. I got chatting to an ex marine dressed top to tail in authentic 1940's threads. Several old fashioneds later and he tells me he his 1930's Buick parked outside and asks if I wanted to see some night spots in the city. I obliged and it was great way to see the city and some interesting whisky bars. Despite being heavily inebriated managed to get a few photos, this being one- Taken on a Nikon F using Kodak 400tx Film", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdJiwppu1ANoYuRTbzy3VN4PASSMdNgGbi2uou2oMW7Td", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWcVHW8ociYpQZS3TzoD1WsfmDhHk2XBCiSwcTiYm7bbE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdJiwppu1ANoYuRTbzy3VN4PASSMdNgGbi2uou2oMW7Td", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Pk7oQQsEBc2eB8BFj4FBLYNvrmrodg2wc"], "tags": ["Black&White", "Monochrome", "Timeless", "B&W", "Vintage", "Film", "35mm"], "extra": {}}
