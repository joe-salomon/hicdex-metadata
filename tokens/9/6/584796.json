Racing around to come up behind you again.\n\nThe sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older.\nShorter of breath and one day closer to death.\nThe time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say.\n\n\u00a9\ufe0f2021 | 2400x2400px | .MP4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc5p2QFHyx9vPtRCPtMAJddJwEWZQBjoVnYpm5PQo6upL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSj76CJqSL34ADQEttjgGKRc6CvfPPRbQYXQKqACu7yg3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc5p2QFHyx9vPtRCPtMAJddJwEWZQBjoVnYpm5PQo6upL", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fv8SFUGsguArThQruX3ichhhwAxKs8bxs"], "tags": ["digitaart", "space", "bubbles", "2danimation", "nftdrop", "timesymbol"], "extra": {}}
