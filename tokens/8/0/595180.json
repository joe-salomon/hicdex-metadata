This is otherwise known as the Far From Origin problem. this is a study on ophidia, attempting to distill the specificities of any particular species to the morphology of motion and the ability to slither. \n\n2000x2000, 48 frames, .gif, 6MB\n\n@luisfraguada\nhttps://linktr.ee/fraguada\n\nmodel credits: \"Snake + motions\" (https://skfb.ly/opwQu) by Aram Firozy is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmULzPYveKEUSFJUD4ZGqhFW266xqdBmStsSxs7Z2oiPGX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmULzPYveKEUSFJUD4ZGqhFW266xqdBmStsSxs7Z2oiPGX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmULzPYveKEUSFJUD4ZGqhFW266xqdBmStsSxs7Z2oiPGX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1SeV6vmY1nR6xuDPXRx1tWsrhqXCwmXL2j"], "tags": ["\ud83d\udc0d", "3d", "iso", "normal", "isometric", "ophidia", "arithmetic", "floatingpoint", "precision", "error", "farfromorigin", "objkt4xmas"], "extra": {}}
