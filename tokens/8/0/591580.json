{"__version": 1, "token_id": 591580, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Pessimist - eta-49828", "description": "One of ten in The Pessimist series. Generated by a hand-coded python application, it is the first objkt series minted by @TheMaxBore. The Pessimist series is built on an instruction set that combines rectangles, ellipses, clipping paths, and fills to create geometric, conceptual, modern works that are structured in their composition, but organic in their rendition. All quantities, sizes, positions, and pallets are generated by the application. eta-49828 splashes color within a perfectly proportioned gird in an almost musical lightness of form and composition. The art exists as an svg to preserve the integrity of the original and allow viewing and reproduction at any size.\n\nGenerative art created by MaxBore.\nOfficial wallet: maxbore.tez\nOfficial Twitter account: https://twitter.com/themaxbore", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUqhs1RfgdwgWpCxkhwGDrPJr5sETeWDtVr157s7G4DHj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUqhs1RfgdwgWpCxkhwGDrPJr5sETeWDtVr157s7G4DHj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUqhs1RfgdwgWpCxkhwGDrPJr5sETeWDtVr157s7G4DHj", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1fZnsguzqqSryegHiirsUVnNJmJcqUbtWR"], "tags": ["abstract", "abstractart", "algorithmicart", "art", "artoftheday", "codeart", "conceptualart", "contemporaryart", "creativecodeart", "design", "digitalart", "generativeart", "generativeartist", "generativearts", "generativeartstudio", "generativearttoys", "generativedesign", "geometricart", "graphicdesign", "mathart", "modernart", "nft", "proceduralart", "processart", "visualart", "MaxBore"], "extra": {}}
