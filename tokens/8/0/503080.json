Nothing had changed around me, but I clearly felt that the ground had gone from under my feet and I was in weightlessness. The whole world has turned upside down, and he is no longer familiar, he is completely alien, a little disturbing, but at the same time incredibly alluring. \n\nThis place is a \u901a\u5f80\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u95e8\u6237. The mirrored world. \u5728\u955c\u5b50\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u8fb9 is like a dream. No, more like the world of dreams. Everything in it is phantom and unnatural, brought to the point of absurdity; but when I am in it, everything seems more real than reality itself, as if I see something that I could not notice before.\n\nThe real world feels so two-dimensional, plastic and superficial compared to \u5728\u955c\u5b50\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u8fb9. It, in turn, consists of many dimensions, constantly pulsating and changing, flowing from one to another, merging and splitting before you could notice.\n\n\u5728\u955c\u5b50\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u8fb9 frightens, inspires numbing horror, but you want to return there again and again, it is mysterious, it beckons and whispers. \"There\u201d I feel infinite. I don't have a beginning, I won't have an end. There I am immortal, but as vulnerable as ever before. \n\nThere is a gigantic force that presses on me from the outside and bursts me from the inside. I feel its presence with my whole body, with the whole gamut of feelings. No, it's as if a completely new feeling awakens in me, focused solely on the perception of this vigour.\n\nStaying in this place is just as difficult as seeing a dream again that just slipped away after waking up. Sometimes I see pictures and photographs and with unshakable confidence I understand - this is it. They were there too. And now I am here. It will end in 7 seconds. But how wonderful it is.\n\nThese are metopes from dreams. \u041d\u0435\u0442, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u043d \u043d\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0443. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWWM7CiQ2fH9pyS1WoPhJbiN1UUrsrCoXskoVAN3ApBGT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS4KKJoVgdQtCzcMmuzhHzTwX4NG7BbJ1RTLPfvcKDpsU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWWM7CiQ2fH9pyS1WoPhJbiN1UUrsrCoXskoVAN3ApBGT", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LDFVV1u4NRkSAQ36g2uZbpkkf3M9bC1fQ"], "tags": ["drain", "animation"], "extra": {}}
