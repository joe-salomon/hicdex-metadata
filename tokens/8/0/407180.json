It is placed at the entrance doors so as to attract the attention of the devotees. Sometimes it is to be found on the pillars and the corners of the ceilings of the roofs or on the head-dresses of the images of deities.\n\nIn temples, the passage to the most holy courts is only possible through the open mouth of the K\u0101la. This step is meant as symbolic death and as cleansing for anyone wishing to get closer to the gods and to Shiva.\n\nThe Kirtimukha is symbolic of our thoughtless pursuit of worldly possessions and pleasures, and has been placed prominently in places of worship to remind us: \u201cUntil you recognize the existence of this avaricious nature in you and conquer over it, your spiritual quest can not even begin.\u201d\n\nThe Kirtimukha is a personification of \u2018glory\u2019 aka pride, arrogance, in short, ego. The kirtimukha serves as a reminder to everybody that ego is essentially self destructive. Ego sustains itself by consuming everything in the person it whom it resides. Kirtimukha is thus a threshold guardian to maturity, to the deepening of wisdom.\n\nArtwortk by C0D3 - 2000X2000 - 300dpi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTkPZmcMLVRpfRgftPu9RiCB84NAp27ZaWkQXVfghfJK2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTkPZmcMLVRpfRgftPu9RiCB84NAp27ZaWkQXVfghfJK2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTkPZmcMLVRpfRgftPu9RiCB84NAp27ZaWkQXVfghfJK2", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1T2EuVzezzTScPiZbERWfKQHNMvrSRvLVy"], "tags": ["c0d3", "psychedelic", "tibetan", "Kirtimukha", "guardian", "meditation", "surrealism", "esoteric", "alchemy", "trippy", "hallucinogenic", "portal", "2D", "animation"], "extra": {}}
