Our love affair started when we first laid eyes on each other in one of Bali's State Universities.\n\nLately, my relationship with her has been a little strained. There have been times when she and I have argued over small things. The longer we argue, the more I am afraid these trivial matters could escalate into larger ones. Our relationship could use some work, and I'd do anything to be able to spend the rest of my days with her.\n\nThese tones that I created are the only thing in my life right now.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSvvVvki7vbj1N7pr4ApD4BJNtoHaaiPiK2znrrXfLfDC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT83bWM3tduKng4geHW2Eyv48SLdif33eMeaFtXWo8V5y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://Qmf1B9yghJpkmyc6fd4eYkyHnG8kXMqSbBXDPrdL2pqiY8", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSvvVvki7vbj1N7pr4ApD4BJNtoHaaiPiK2znrrXfLfDC", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YfFxT6YriLw12rm82V6mMEoS4QF4LkBp5"], "tags": ["nftmusic", "music", "song", "photo", "photography", "lover", "punk", "electronic", "artist", "songwriter", "producer"], "extra": {}}
