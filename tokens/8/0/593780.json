In my frustration and sorrow I smeared the paint from the original image. As time passed and the paint dried there was more bad news. A large mass was found in his left lung. I returned to the painting an drew this on top going over some of the remaning image. Whenever adversity strikes I'm reminded of a quote from the bible when Jesus said, \"Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, \u2018Move from here to there,\u2019 and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d Mathew 17:20 I'm not sure if I've ever been able to move the mountain in front of me but I have learned to fly grace fully over it. A lot of emotions went into this painting. What does it make you feel?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVmXgAJW655GpyXixcL6LrfTLJrSSW91QdiLsGaPFfRcS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZEWn1je2BQv9ZXvS6qwPXAXsx2nJoo5ccYGhysPCHRbt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmRurwYGeeMNjNFJDD7qbEPkpVZWacJtpeyzsukg5Hw9SM", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVmXgAJW655GpyXixcL6LrfTLJrSSW91QdiLsGaPFfRcS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XpQsuBRvwwH66PejWM4rAcbXAmp2eSoLQ"], "tags": ["AcrylicPainting", "Journal"], "extra": {}}
