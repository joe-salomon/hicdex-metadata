They took their first bite, and felt an energy boost flowing through their bodies. As soon as they finished the first fruit, the second one started to move and transformed into a pumpkin. The energy contained in it brought the pumpkin to life. It kidnapped Dino and Jaru and jumped into a black hole. They reached the 19th Magical Location: The Spooky Castle.

Dino and Jaru decide to drink from the river and enjoy the party.
