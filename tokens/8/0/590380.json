Ever since my daughter was born I've wanted to create an alternative \"Cool Alphabet\" that would lean towards the nerdy art persuasion. I was looking through my old photos and found the original Kaws show from The High in 2012. We were supposed to be able to watch him paint this finger in the gallery, but one day it was there... and a few months later it was gone again. K is for Kaws is the start of my alternative alphabet.
