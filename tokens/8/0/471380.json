From hardcore punk, crust, post-punk to metal and hiphop. All profits from this CD were dedicated to organizing efforts in local grassroot movement, from street library to autonomous community space. The CD was accompanied by a booklet containing writings about social change within our city, as well as interviews with communities who have one common thread in terms of building a network of autonomous movement through active initiatives of direct democracy, organizing and empowering communities using various methods and media.
