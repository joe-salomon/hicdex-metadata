After emitting a flash of light, the circumference turns to a fine mist and travels to the nearest Yassify Tree, where it will be absorbed by the trunk.\n    \nThe sphere works as a kind of camera. The slayer is photographed by this ethereal mass and the photo is then transported to the nearest Yassify Tree, where it will be transmuted into a Yass Record - a physical representation of the yass moment.\n    \nIt's important to emphasise that not all yass moments are transformed into Yass Records. Only the most accurate go through this process.\n    \nAccording to rumors, these trees are worshiped as deities by certain inhabitants of the Digidise. Some Arca\u2019s mutations, the Sponge Bob Moneylender, the WhatsApp Camel and others have already been spotted performing rituals around these plants. Furthermore, it is found that the slayers represented there acquire enormous social status and are respected as masters by the inhabitants of the region where the tree is located.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbDZf3p63m26zgCzm8AU5KcvShREhdi6SrLN1QyjmzkUL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS3ennV8Z3kVV6gNNQNujdDTMiUnUCMTarZ3jcigLRxiu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbDZf3p63m26zgCzm8AU5KcvShREhdi6SrLN1QyjmzkUL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NcxdtUXMGGbDVTRFWVjuM87NWB3iYgoGx"], "tags": ["yass", "meme", "yassify", "postmodernity", "internet", "postmodern", "illustration", "photography", "digital"], "extra": {}}
