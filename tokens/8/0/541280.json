Very few things. I remember when I was a kid and bought a magazine about the Hubble telescope. I am still captivated. There is very little left to see through Webb's eye. Waiting, this year, my father died. Now he sees it and understands it all. We are so small and so big at the same time.\nBetween 2017 and 2019 some twitter bots, @pixelsorter (\u2020)/ by Way Spurr-Chen- @botisionista / by sebadelprado - @FFD8FFDB (\u2020)/ by Derek Arnold -, created and exchanged more than 85 thousand images.\nThese collectibles, thought as stele / socket are created from his works. With this project and this collection I rescued a moment that keeps making me reflect on art, creation / creator and the new speed that the present has.\n\n\nTwitter account @Solibot1", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb1QL5nSfwpJZBrqMGmhHnwDuPx7Qi5WcpqcW5VJvPgqq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTVMmXhVnPTSXW7CQai7Gxpf3cM7KJGVuDzngRXYKiGFu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb1QL5nSfwpJZBrqMGmhHnwDuPx7Qi5WcpqcW5VJvPgqq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1cSDieadCscchDugwQT3ZFCZkuarNMJDLZ"], "tags": ["jamesWebb"], "extra": {}}
