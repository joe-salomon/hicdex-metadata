Art from this system is generated by sampling points from a C++ implementation of the fractal flame iterated function system, and rendering the corresponding Voronoi tessellation using R. The tessellation is hard to see, because the colour palette is used as concealer: applying the same colour to adjacent cells masks the boundaries that would otherwise reveal the truth. It's a skill every masochist aquires, and if you're going to date sadists you'd best be prepared.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYXQfy8H5QfFAQmqm3VcZP3wGSSicSbiXeZiYF7WxQDun", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRrhXFor1fQr1GmbXounUQ9m6j4A3oETnZEBeU9hkN9Fo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYXQfy8H5QfFAQmqm3VcZP3wGSSicSbiXeZiYF7WxQDun", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hXKn2BcU64HxSrmojfuf7cDoweJ9xwxZ7"], "tags": ["generativeart", "iteratedfunctionsystems", "voronoitesselations", "sadomasochism"], "extra": {}}
