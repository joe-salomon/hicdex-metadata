Whether headed to Earth or Moon Kitty Komet is on the job. Stray found Kitty\u2019s are brought to Kitty Verse which brings expansion to the planet. Carrying loads of diamonds Kitty Komet is able to provide to those in need. Luckily, for Kitty Comet there are many Kitty Angels who watch over her when she's out late at night and into the morning hours.  This Little Kitty is a workaholic. objkt4objkt\n\n2160 x 2160\nCodecs - H.264 \nSong:  Little Ditty Written by: JBR Visuals\n\nKitty Verse is a sovereign planet North/West of the digital galaxy. In this planet there are Kitty's, kitty's of all colours, ideology, technology and musicology. There is no discrimination in Kitty Verse of sex, race, origin, group, or religion. All kitties are welcome here. However, there is an unstated basic need for Kitty's survival on this planet to follow and it's simple, really: be kind to one another and help out those in need at all times. Kitty's are provided Diamond's for every notable good deed by \"Kitty Diamond Angels\". 3 collected Diamonds provides access to Kitty Raven's Kitty Nip Club. The Club is an overnight Capital where most all Kitty's in Kitty Verse will stay for the evening. Kitty's with access get to dance to EDM, Hip Hop, Bhangra, whatever is on the playlist. As well Kitties are invited to play, lounge, eat, groom one another, and kitty-nip if they so choose or Kitty Nap! The Club opens at 10pm nightly, the re-opens it's doors to exit Kitties by 6:00am daily. Kitty Raven provides this space for the stake of safety, provisions and play.\nThose Kitty's who are less fortunate to have collected the 3 Diamond per diem generally seek a comet, star, crater, moon beam, or other floating objects and or passerby's in the galaxy to hang out on and off of Kitty Verse during the 10-6am time frame.\n\nHmmm, why is that?\n\nWell... there is one Kitty who's entered the atmosphere who doesn't play well at all! Isn't there always?  Kitty Verse Kitty's have not witnessed the look of this \"Kat\" to date. However, the Kitties senses are very keen.\nThis lurking Skuttley Stag Campy Kitty is not at all kind, sweet or playful. Nor does it share kitty! It speaks a different language then that of other Kitty's and yet carries an essence, rather scent, so unusual an odor Kitty's become confused. That is to say this peculiar smell is so queer that to identify would maintain that Kitties themselves would have experienced the transgression.\nThe unknown element has never entered Kitty Raven's Nip Club, well yet...\n\n\"Kitty Verse\" was created by using I-Movie, Keynote, Glitchy Psychedelic Camera VHS, l Motion Leap by Light Tricks  Music in these videos provided by JBR Visuals.\nLove and Light, \nJBR\n\nkitty, illustrator, cat, space, astro, digital, tune, jbr visuals", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZcJQzoq5NYWCXxN18syyS8wWhReqKRT5THJdD18qGtmZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSgFPoucfxpAxVb96UhrVWh83c4adSR1E9sJ8TWwdpzm2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZcJQzoq5NYWCXxN18syyS8wWhReqKRT5THJdD18qGtmZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YnGERWRoH1UYyh9mx5ZeTcLMbTfr7WfsD"], "tags": ["objkt4objkt", "kitty", "illustraion", "mixedmedia", "glitch", "jbrvisuals", "cat", "space", "comet"], "extra": {}}
