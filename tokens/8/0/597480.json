Gundam Series) is a Japanese military fiction media franchise/media mix. Created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise, the franchise features giant robots, or mecha, with the name \"Gundam\". The franchise began on April 7, 1979 with Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined the \"real robot\" mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots called mobile suits (including the original titular mecha) in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes 50 TV series, films and OVAs as well as manga, novels and video games, along with a whole industry of plastic model kits known as Gunpla which makes up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQirdtaQUn7APThfwfYWWurmfEMmyhSpsbAC65Ww9txtS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQirdtaQUn7APThfwfYWWurmfEMmyhSpsbAC65Ww9txtS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQirdtaQUn7APThfwfYWWurmfEMmyhSpsbAC65Ww9txtS", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1gGMbvMSmVJmCqpYLjTXom2okbP1qZ5UJG"], "tags": ["pixel"], "extra": {}}
