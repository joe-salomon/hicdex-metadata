{"__version": 1, "token_id": 352780, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Helium-3 Isotope", "description": "Helium-3 is a light, stable isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron. Other than protium, helium-3 is the only stable isotope of any element with more protons than neutrons. Helium-3 was discovered in 1939. Virtually all helium-3 used in industry today is produced from the radioactive decay of tritium, given its very low natural abundance and its very high cost. \n\n--Wikipedia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW46MGBYouskbCU5EwvAZukb8JLaNJRwuiNz76gZMAWF4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW46MGBYouskbCU5EwvAZukb8JLaNJRwuiNz76gZMAWF4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW46MGBYouskbCU5EwvAZukb8JLaNJRwuiNz76gZMAWF4", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1fpk4STcmBF7fcJ8ik7SVmamfb6DjzeAge"], "tags": ["helium", "isotope", "chemistry", "physics", "RGB", "GIF", "photoshop", "animation", "diagram", "figure1", "AI", "machinelearning", "elements", "atoms", "atomic"], "extra": {}}
