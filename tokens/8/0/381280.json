Let me just say that there are tons of amazing moments and character growth throughout the season, and the writers even opened up a better, unexpected, alternate story path between Otis and Ruby, and Maeve and Isaac. Unfortunately, they seem to have scrapped that and gone with their original relationship goal. Sucks. Anywho, that's my girly rant for the day. I hope you enjoy this addition to the series!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdUSK4kJXmTQkxvmzP27abnT6Jgdx6UpMuL7Udu6QCdNN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYHUs8a7XGLWFasSMZ4p7bEtvyJszD2QHZGAfhcp7i7zs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdUSK4kJXmTQkxvmzP27abnT6Jgdx6UpMuL7Udu6QCdNN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rn339EyYkX4ygVtZ61XpLTBe5hikvFUa7"], "tags": ["visiblethoughts", "collection", "series", "collectibles", "trending", "nfts", "nftartist", "cryptoart", "hicetnunc", "popular", "journaling", "calligraphy", "handwriting", "unique", "different", "cool", "scrapbook", "collage"], "extra": {}}
