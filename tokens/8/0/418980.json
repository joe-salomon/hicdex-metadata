I have never been the best photographer, I always focused on being REAL. So, every mistake is a way to show my learning journey. \n\nI wrote this as a prediction of my way.\nI always knew that my last stop traveling would be my home.\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS4YmpEgqByLuXF3MWedaYyKYCr6cLXj2dvEdf5UiMtUp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYHnJCbQQTr4Jxbmv2cRLgXXrVVm4UKvbNVPenrxMWTx3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS4YmpEgqByLuXF3MWedaYyKYCr6cLXj2dvEdf5UiMtUp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ichPK6qRDokxcguriiARTvsLkFzRvoXGp"], "tags": ["nftart", "photez", "cityscape", "postcard", "author", "southamerica", "hen", "juancolacioppo", "photo", "henarg", "elviajedemisfotos", "argentina", "photography", "buenosaires", ""], "extra": {}}
