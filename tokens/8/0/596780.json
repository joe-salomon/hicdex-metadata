{"__version": 1, "token_id": 596780, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "TEN Conoid 2021", "description": "Right circular conoid is a shape which, depending on the viewing angle, can resemble a square, a circle, or a triangle. It is composed only of straight lines. More generally, a conoid is a ruled surface, whose rulings (lines) are parallel to a plane (the directrix plane) and intersect a fixed line (the axis). The conoid is a right conoid, if its axis is perpendicular to its directrix plane. If the directrix is a circle, the conoid is called circular conoid.\n\nThe term conoid (in Greek meaning \"similar to a cone\") was first used by Archimedes in his treatise \"On conoids and spheroids\". Conoids, like other ruled surfaces, are of high interest to architects because they can be built using straight elements. TEN Studio is very fond of this seemingly simple, elegant and pragmatic shape.\n\nDesigned by Scott Lloyd in 2021 for TEN Studio -> https://ten.studio\n\ngif, 1000 x 1000 pix, 250 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNTMQoXuqCRvsPtaTctfQRUg7eY6q44i6MRYi4ZwWFjfw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNTMQoXuqCRvsPtaTctfQRUg7eY6q44i6MRYi4ZwWFjfw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNTMQoXuqCRvsPtaTctfQRUg7eY6q44i6MRYi4ZwWFjfw", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1UjRUAWBdLHwnSun4MsSESsPAMrCF5V4Rg"], "tags": ["conoid", "animation", "3D", "geometric", "ruled", "minimal", "abstract", "wireframe", "architectural", "design", "monochrome"], "extra": {}}
