They dress up in colorful and varied costumes. \n\nA very common costume in this celebration is that of Crying Gyko.\n\nCrying Gyko is a character from Morondanguean mythology.\n\nThe legend says that Gyko was a sweet child spoiled by his mother who one day got lost in the forest. His desperate mother prayed to all the Peppos(**), made the appropriate rituals, but nothing happened. Gyko never appeared. One morning, when a bread seller was wandering through the forest, he began to hear the cry of a child. He looked for him everywhere. The cry seemed to be coming from under a stone. When he lifted the stone there was nothing but small insects.\n\nMany people have said they heard Gyko crying from under a rock. Some people even leave pacifiers on top of the stone in question. \nThere are those who say that Gyko is all grown up and wanders around the Carnival disguised as himself, crying.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021\n\n\n(*) See OBJKTs #220679 #234959 #294497 #424158 #473913\n(**) See OBJKTS #307756 #353041 #415410 #538645\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSadxHukzyT1mDr97HP4WV8jXfConkkP61846duZCtaWC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTUshVrnYFUu9kyrVvAi4JRtoBK3zpcFy5BP1re8FxSC3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSadxHukzyT1mDr97HP4WV8jXfConkkP61846duZCtaWC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Carnival", "Stamp", "Morondanga"], "extra": {}}
