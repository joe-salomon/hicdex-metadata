As we often did during those days my and my friend Dom would sit in the same room in front of our computers each making our daily projets. I would often make 3D elements for him as he would help me with particle systems and after effect editing. Dom created a version in After effects and I created this op art scene setup in cinema 4D  before I rendered it he insisted on using the latest GSG Hdri Link for the lighting. I listened to his advice and this is what came at the end od the render.\n\nSince I dont use giphy at all he posted it here\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/cinema4d-everyday-target-KcDynUpadoYbGH2fbr\n65,306 Views (on mint day)\n\n\nXponentialdesign After Effects + Trapcode Mir version\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/geometry-sphere-op-art-UvVM1MEuOPf4sElqWo\n327,690 Views (on mint day)\n\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/minimal-hypnotic-monochrome-UtP68T7VIODuZ5tr64\n22,435,223 Views (on mint day)\n ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSAaEGHcbEPmnkFzpw86txnYTuSdwZ5ax9hdem3v6TDcS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSAaEGHcbEPmnkFzpw86txnYTuSdwZ5ax9hdem3v6TDcS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSAaEGHcbEPmnkFzpw86txnYTuSdwZ5ax9hdem3v6TDcS", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1dBeswgYbWpuuubXxsiX8fYAckDXYQkBP2"], "tags": ["cinema4d", "sphere", "hypnotic", "opart", "monochrome", "seamless", "animation3d", "psychedelic"], "extra": {}}
