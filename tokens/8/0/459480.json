That's how we are arranged.\nWorking as a psychologist until recently, I had an idea of \u200b\u200bworking with almost any query. The only question that always makes me be as careful and cautious with patients is suicide.\nAt certain moments, such thoughts visit me and myself, but the deeper I delve into this topic, the more it pushes me away and I begin to pay attention to the beautiful phenomena in life. I'm looking for new meanings. The other day I had the experience of such work. I was imbued with love and maximum presence and found in it the authenticity and honesty of looking at the world without any masks, for which I am very thankful, because I was able to review my life in the prism of love and acceptance. Thank you for being here! Take care of yourself!\n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2021, 80x70cm  Spray paint on canvas 8323x9737 pix.\n\nThe first collector of this NFT will receive this original painting.\n1st collector, please DM me via Twitter @Maks_Denysenko & I'll send it to you!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVWneDfyqHJwC3YDKXMb9EQfvKZU7EiYtFqV7831aszp3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNn9JyzFGmjeHUnQDvrd9e5ssSvz7KuGZ6QiJzkL7268u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVWneDfyqHJwC3YDKXMb9EQfvKZU7EiYtFqV7831aszp3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["colorful", "painting", "life", "original", "spraypaint", "canvas"], "extra": {}}
