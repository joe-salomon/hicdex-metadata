Amen\u201d For every good deed in life there is a bad. We have all wronged someone, we have all made mistakes, we have all failed at some point in our life. There comes a time where we must face our sins, confront our mistakes and seek absolution & forgiveness, for death brings judgement upon us. But we shouldn\u2019t care about higher powers judging us. We must search within our soul to correct and heal the wrongs we have done. And that is my journey of Absolution.
