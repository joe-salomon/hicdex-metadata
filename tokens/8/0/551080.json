However, none of those exoplanets have been imaged to the level where we could see their surface in detail. This artwork is an AI art impression of the surface of a hypothetical exoplanet. The AI art model imagined the details of the surface without seeing any images of exoplanets, with the help of creative algorithms and careful tuning. The first owner of the NFT will receive an extended version of the work in 4K (3840\u00d72160) resolution. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ4xeEpgfhJaUPJZ79UracYPRqF1ngHd5h8ZrJWp53T2j", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX9U1AfgmeTXvtstJDbmWMgdD8iMm6ki6qU32dNMzkTW6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ4xeEpgfhJaUPJZ79UracYPRqF1ngHd5h8ZrJWp53T2j", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fExZsYhXdEttn3cFMcJt9AJpaAgeBsWME"], "tags": ["AIart\uff0canimation\uff0cGANart\uff0cgenerative\uff0clandscape\uff0cloop\uff0csunset\uff0csurreal\uff0cverisartcertified"], "extra": {}}
