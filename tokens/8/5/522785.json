That's a tall order for sure to create something like that, but hat you see is my best effort. We have 10 lines of words that then broken up into 5 pairs of lines. Each pair of lines begins with either \"ARTIST,\" or starts with \"ART IS\". We then use words that have a certain type of dynamism to them. (What the heck is \"a certain type of dynamism\" Andrew?) Words like HE/HIS/HEFT have the unique ability to add a \"T\" to the front and thus creating a completely new word with a completely different definition. So as we get into the lines we see a distinct pattern happening. ARTIST, HE / ART IS THE becomes ARTIST, HIS / ART IS THIS becomes ARTIST HEFT / ART IS THEFT, etc. The result is an almost sculptural monolith of pretentiously unpretentious, pretentious artwork that aptly refers back in and onto itself over and over and over again claiming that the artist is something or the art is something when clearly it is just words that fit into a pattern that the artist made to make you think that it means something deep. Wow, that was a mouthful and I'm pretty sure that was a run-on sentence.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQpRzvYNw1KgFk8WbiTQGMBnNDxBtnfAVAUekXiy3c6A3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY2EGeApf3QdXRd53nU2KqgyATb3GnwzhRvsphCqtp8gn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQpRzvYNw1KgFk8WbiTQGMBnNDxBtnfAVAUekXiy3c6A3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
