After a memorable war, her older brother, Willescar the Sea Drinker took the crown at a young age. After the coronation, he started to become a very mean and dictator person. He always wanted to control everything around him, even his sister's happiness. He didn't want Githrid to be married to a village boy. And he exiled the Githrid\u2019s lover Yesren to the very harsh lands of the kingdom. But Githrid and Yesren never stopped loving each other. They always tried to write a letter secretly. And here She's just received a letter from her lover, Yesren the Exiled.\n\"\"\"\nMy love, my dear, I have nothing around here, but without you, it seems more difficult than anything. I cry every day praying for us in the Moni Pantheon. I buy big candles for my prayers to be answered, but this increases the torment of the priests. The light of the candle I lit gives me more hope than the sunlight coming here. Do not lose hope every time you see the sky. We can both rejoice, let's look at the sky.\n\"\"\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbUTpScHWzpghiULDzAHjuBFkza6ArAGzZwsh3aqqU5A3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbUTpScHWzpghiULDzAHjuBFkza6ArAGzZwsh3aqqU5A3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbUTpScHWzpghiULDzAHjuBFkza6ArAGzZwsh3aqqU5A3", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1bcaZTEBjHA3Uy6TmsD2R5jhBeyoGNkCgR"], "tags": ["pixelart", "pixel", "lore", "sadness", "letter", "queen", "cliff", "sea", "sky", "clouds"], "extra": {}}
