This specific series deals with image and our relationship with art as a society && individuals.\n // \n\"Some think that so much of today\u2019s art mirrors and thus criticizes decadence, not so \u2013 it\u2019s just decadent, full stop. It has no critical function, it is part of the problem. The art world beautifully copies our money driven, celebrity obsessed, entertainment culture; same fixation on fame, same obedience to mass media that jostles for our attention with its noise and wow and flutter.\" -Robert Hughes\n // \nPROCESS: Databend [jpg, png, tiff, gif, webp], Processing, Java. \nFirst I glitched the Mona Lisa in Notepad++ in different image formats, then fed those images through a glitch program written in Processing.
