All that is wanted is the sweet release as the water falls. Have you ever heard the sound of the rain on a tin roof while you\u2019re safe and warm inside? The beauty of the sound penetrates you and relaxes you to your core. There is a release in your body and your mind as the sound transports you and expands you into the moment. This release by its very nature can sow seeds of peace and calm in your being.\n\nThe breaking of the waters just happens, the dam breaks, everything is released and the time has come. When the rain finally falls everyone and everything rejoices. \n\nEverything is shifting and moving to a new phase. You know because you can feel the release within you. Release comes after acceptance of where you are. The Universe is answering with releasing what\u2019s on the inside out into the world.  \n\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd5GLNSRvtNgRWu315Kt3kLF5G6GiiRpR56sF4T8PYyDq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX8EqNgZ6h3RRXUjvLtC5BMnqvvmw5h1azyMTdXDv3TKE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd5GLNSRvtNgRWu315Kt3kLF5G6GiiRpR56sF4T8PYyDq", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
