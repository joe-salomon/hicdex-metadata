Every year, it is a festival to open a box of cakes with salted eggs or green beans. I always imagine people riding something weirder in the mid-autumn festival so I drew this picture :)))))", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYX2f8s7QsrKBvvkfCsrPo6dYwu3LkLPFr81VbutYJEX7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXXtkaSqJ6TFZqHuZpHBj5GAZNSCdk86nr3KAamgxUYFd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYX2f8s7QsrKBvvkfCsrPo6dYwu3LkLPFr81VbutYJEX7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1biFE9nezUkAEZmZGtGqWawH3VpFdpmbhk"], "tags": ["Mid-Autumn", "art", "fishing", "festival"], "extra": {}}
