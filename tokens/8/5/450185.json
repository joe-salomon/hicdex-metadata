He is also known as the Pope or the Teacher in other Tarot decks and is ruled by Taurus.\n\nThe Hierophant is a religious figure sitting between two pillars of a sacred temple \u2013 though this temple differs from the one in which the High Priestess sits. He wears three robes \u2013 red, blue and white \u2013 and a three-tiered crown, both representing the three worlds over which he rules (the conscious, sub-conscious and super-conscious). In his left hand, he holds the Papal Cross, a triple sceptre that signifies his religious status. He raises his right hand in a religious blessing, with two fingers pointing towards Heaven and two towards Earth.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTzEnnf6W9gjB6AjbNTAKkxFBNYnD39a6uR7HVyNTufue", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQxKTqgdqCLjSB3xdBmDiUkaYDj24CMmEXYFZVeRrtXpN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTzEnnf6W9gjB6AjbNTAKkxFBNYnD39a6uR7HVyNTufue", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gw7LKELrjh7ufLGqza84xvB5ZebkajdkL"], "tags": ["3d", "3dtarot", "symbolism", "dark", "occult", "tarot", "nftarot"], "extra": {}}
