Also it seems that this week (10/10) we had Pixel Day ???, at least at twitter idk...\n\nI wanted to do something diferent, so instead of doing one pixel plant for the Pink Leaves series, I've done an unique black leaves. Contrary to what you might think, after all, color black absorbs all the energy, having black leaves is not necessarily better for photosynthesis: taking in more energy than necessary can cause heat stress (and all the plant process need a specific amount of energy, not more, neither less), leading to a negative effect in the plant. But at least: goths will love you.\n\nID: Colocasia esculenta.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYXiwsX27DhMs8mek17AoeVqfaoqG1JjP6EdYdfnCey9H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYXiwsX27DhMs8mek17AoeVqfaoqG1JjP6EdYdfnCey9H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYXiwsX27DhMs8mek17AoeVqfaoqG1JjP6EdYdfnCey9H", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tk4hbkA49TPyyqyLYBLBygz7S2nRCMQpd"], "tags": ["pixelart", "pixel", "plant", "black", "brazilianartist", "nature", "giveaway", "colocasia"], "extra": {}}
