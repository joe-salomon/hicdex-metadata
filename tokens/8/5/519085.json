{"__version": 1, "token_id": 519085, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The Demit (#2)", "description": "I am struggling with my arts. Something that hits me so bad. Which is pornography, religion, culture, etc. I am sick of it! I don't mean to fight against them. Just express me through the arts. I create The Demit, people said it is inappropriate! It is porn! It's a sin! Big sin! I have no backup, intelligence is not enough for them. Just violence. They don't really care about what I am trying to tell them through my arts. They see what they see. Also, I was disturbed by people who always blamed for all bad things happen to them. Someday, my brother died in a traffic accident and the one who hit him, he said that he was unconscious and didn't watch my brother ride through him. Like see a Demit (demon). It was at night, try to make it sense and be sorry. Until I heard that somewhere in Thailand if you did something wrong (crime) in this case you are possessed by a demon you free to go. Out of human law. But it is a higher level of law. I disagree if there is any mistake in what people do they always blame it on Demit. So through my words and illustrations, I wanna ask people to think again and ask for ourselves that everything we do has a consequence and all about it is came from us. Not the others. You are your own demon.\n\nStop-motion (GIF)\n3240\u200a\u00d7\u200a4585\n35.816.322 bita (35.8 MB)\nRGB\n2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVNYYKb9uULgonhRUBy8Fewt3frMTaLLqAZwQEtBX1ssk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVNYYKb9uULgonhRUBy8Fewt3frMTaLLqAZwQEtBX1ssk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVNYYKb9uULgonhRUBy8Fewt3frMTaLLqAZwQEtBX1ssk", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1gYUCjPztSCo2TSf2XBQY9Y3FH7amsuX79"], "tags": ["demon", "devil", "illustration", "animation", "gif", "arwork", "contemporary", "art"], "extra": {}}
