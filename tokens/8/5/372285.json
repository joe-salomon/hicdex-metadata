The blue skin color spiritually represents peace, something that we all seek in life.\n2048x2048 px,jpg.This NFT art is hand drawn digitally using a stylus pen in the Sketchbook program on an Ipad Pro device\n\nFrom That's Me series x DettyToski\nIn a contemplation space, what does it means to save oneself ?\nIt's just ironic as there's no cure. And I start reflecting on my life.\nThe power I can have.\nThe thought to escape and take control.\nI'll turn your world into ash and treat you like you're the lamb\nYou can sit here wallowing in your ignorance.\nLooking for any reason, you can deny\nBecause life and death decisions are once yours \nbut the two sisters (words) will no longer hurt me\n\nIn this series, I portrays the contrast of bright neon colours as the struggle one\u2019s most often has in dealing with bipolar disorder.
