If someone is labeled as a \u201csquare,\u201d it is usually an insult that they are rigid, overly studious, too pragmatic, or very basic.  \n\nTo give us a sense of being grounded and balanced here in the physical world. We are physical beings that need structure, community, and direction in order to survive. The square gives us all of these survival needs. \n\nLook at the house you are in right now. The foundation is built on squares. This is symbolic of the foundations of life that are found in the shape of the square. Together, the four elements of the earth blend harmoniously to allow the foundations of life to form, and for us to thrive. \n\nIn medieval depictions of the square, it was almost always connected to the human body, representing \u201cman\u201d and the physical elements of our being. In artistic representations of our human nature, the square, triangle, and circle usually appear, bringing a symphony of shapes that represent body, soul, and spirit; the square being the body. \n\nVisual:\nby introboiz\n2560 X 1440\n12501kbps\n15 fps\n.mp4\n\nAudio:\nby bumbbuku\n319kbps\n48000kHz\n.wav", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVFtyowhPdcAbFbtdKWE8dGndgCnEPdz4iLLxQ2ubQ8Qe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV5Br1bMoepqg2P2WKgZCzcGgYS4RDgBaznoGsVX5zXHV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmYP16Ag3ndCeid8GScDApRQiYXbUwisQw5SdjGpaqBEm9", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVFtyowhPdcAbFbtdKWE8dGndgCnEPdz4iLLxQ2ubQ8Qe", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1XBffw8QWeLoUA5WL6eb3pPxqUaNz1mNC6"], "tags": ["motion", "sounddesign", "loop", "rectangle", "basicshapes", "audiovisual"], "extra": {}}
