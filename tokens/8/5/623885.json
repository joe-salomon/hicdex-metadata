When I first met my wife we dated long distance for a year. We talked on the phone every day and only got to see each other maybe once a month until she uprooted and moved to Atlanta to be with me for good. Up to that point I would think about her constantly and living apart made the time we had together each month that much more intense. I missed her so badly when we were apart I just knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. Almost 15 years after we met she is still my muse.
