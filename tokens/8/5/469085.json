(red)\n\nthat your community needs? (blue)\n\nthat you are good at? (green)\n\nand you can be paid for? (yellow)\n\nAnd by asking these questions, you'll find out your Passion (orange), your Mission (Purple), your Vocation (Turquoise), and your Profession (Lime-green).\n\nMaybe you are not good at all the things you love, or you are not sure what career to pursue yet, but we are only humans, and as humans we are here to grow and discover ourselves.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYmMepZsmDfFMCmGdcRiQTJAaQpFPgzm9AGMqYNPY9XDt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSQ8zQYqo6YaeZ65ASMCxihsuCM3fYpVXaxUi9ZMNiwAE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYmMepZsmDfFMCmGdcRiQTJAaQpFPgzm9AGMqYNPY9XDt", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WcrcyJBdzR7LqRHvXokcvEymq2NB6xeqr"], "tags": ["Artedigital", "digitalart", "acrylic", "art", "acrylicpainting", "visualart", "ikigai", "artist", ""], "extra": {}}
