Such as a Japanese human faced android, this cyborg seems able to feel emotion and desire. \n\nThis artificial creature appears on the screen by successive slices, revealing its mechanical anatomy, while gradually rebuilding its outer shell. Once materialized, this evanescent pinup of modern times is spinning around before disappearing again by regular cuts. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRLAn8T84TPoprx5i7qbUBWdFF4XSUr3Ln1TwehDSco4j", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNfpXXopDXhUkLA7tKjAdiLiv6f23NCiSKj7cLakTs2xy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRLAn8T84TPoprx5i7qbUBWdFF4XSUr3Ln1TwehDSco4j", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iB9J33AcAo2NJJTRAwzPJgoD2LKrSpc5M"], "tags": ["prostheticreality", "eyejack", "PRV2", "AR", "cyborg", "robot", "scifi", "digital", "anatomy", "france", "cadet", "francecadet"], "extra": {}}
