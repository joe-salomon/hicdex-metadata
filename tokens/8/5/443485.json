{"__version": 1, "token_id": 443485, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "\"The Hunt\" - Progress: 1", "description": "A unique progress shot of one of my digital oil paintings; \"The Hunt\". The final piece will be minted in a set of 5 in my \"Call of The Wild\" Collection on OpenSea. This is one of 3 progress shot drops from my painting \"The Hunt\". Collectors who pick up all 3 progress shots will get a 4th airdropped to them. This progress shot was made by turning off layers of the painting in Photoshop, when I saw how beautiful it looked on its own in this way I continued to export my progress during the rest of the making of the piece and came up with this concept of turning the stages of my work into their own NFTs.
