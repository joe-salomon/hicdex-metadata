The word \"Make\" in the poster above is a hand rendered version of the logo of Make Magazine. Make Magazine is devoted to a DIY(do it yourself) approach to technology. Check out their \"Maker's Bill of Rights\".\n\nThe background texture is a digital mashup of a photograph of the ubiquitous reusable holographic foil gift bag.\n\nThe figure in the poster, detail above left, wears a mask inspired by the Prototypes of New Understanding by Canadian artist Brian Jungen. The Prototypes on New Understanding masks are made from flayed Nike Air Jordan running shoes.\n\nThis poster is based on a simpler diagram, commissioned byJoel Katelnikoff, to illustrate his writing A Note on Kites and the Human Sense of Reality: Ten Philosophical Premises Prefaced by a Haiku.     \n\nImage description: Pen and ink drawing with digital collage colouring - image says, \"Make Friends with Mystics\" and shows an anthropomorphic cloud blowing fiery wind at a box kite to which clings a naked man wearing a shamanic mask - all on a contrasty background of holographic wrapping paper.\n\nMake Friends With Mystics is the 5th NFT in the  MemeSwarm Redux 2021 collection\n\n>>> About Meme Swarm Redux 2021 <<<\nThese psychedoodlic haikus were created for a group exhibit called Gene Swarm curated by Rupert Bottenberg and held at Le Kop Shop, Montreal, Canada, during November 2006. The participants were Luke Ramsey, Billy Mavreas, Rupert Bottenberg and Marc Ngui.\n\n<<< Semantic Background >>>\n\nGene Swarm is a term gleaned from one of Terence Mckenna's many monologues. It refers to the flow of genetic information on the earth over millennia as it would be perceived by a consciousness capable of observing events unfolding over extremely long time scales.\nMckenna's point was that individual species (nevermind individuals) would exist only as flickers of flesh while the genetic information would be the continuous elements combining and recombining, dancing each other in and out of prominence as environments changed and evolutionary forces selected the most appropriate combinations. This idea of observing evolution at a bio-molecular level over geologic time seems to have been impossible until the 20th century.\nThe title Meme Swarm was generated when gene was switched to meme as a way of emphasizing information content over biological processes.\n\n>>> About the Creation Process <<<\n\nEach image was first drawn with ink on paper, scanned at a high resolution and digitally coloured and collaged. Many images use classical and famous paintings as backgrounds and these are noted below. Other elements used include personal photographs and images gleaned off the web, also noted below, and patterns and textures generated specifically for this project.\nThey have been remastered and generally improved for their NFT debut.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmez9A4zq6zFM6pninJgERuVmfngYMjuPMCkKjzPD2rkW4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP5Ji9JMiBpbxKn3nPqLsSjf1ns7ZJ8i5zsYQV3X795co", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmez9A4zq6zFM6pninJgERuVmfngYMjuPMCkKjzPD2rkW4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NTY6Prmq4er4RXkGSwGCfjUjkfgyTMR67"], "tags": ["Make", "Makers", "Mask", "Kite", "BrianJungen", "mystic", "visionary", "flying", "selfrealization", "comics", "psychedelic", "handlettering", "wind", "shamanmemeswarmredux2021", "marcngui", "drawing", "penandink", "digitalcolour", "collage", "psychedelic"], "extra": {}}
