The cover art of this song is very special because for this time I had a different mask that will not come out again. All the production of this song and the visuals were created by me (Blu).\n\nArtist- Sad Blu \nProducer- Sad Blu \nCover Art- Sad Blu", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUVSudsFoM9DwcJFsHez3kKnxhUrTvn4oKRC5YR6jezZv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaFia4bbMVmwriN6iu56s1wscCfE7qrMScCreT3nzvJDV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUVSudsFoM9DwcJFsHez3kKnxhUrTvn4oKRC5YR6jezZv", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MqB9v8ew9P1AmMsBfr88greDNVvjWgKSD"], "tags": ["PuertoRico", "Weed", "Illustration", "Cannabis", "Character", "Cartoon", "DigitalPainting", "2D", "Gif", "Blue", "Music", "DigitalArt", "Colorful", "Funk", "Trap", "Colorful"], "extra": {}}
