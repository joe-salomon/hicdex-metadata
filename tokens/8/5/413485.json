Those who remembered the ascension continued to form harmoniou constructions.Once you have experienced the absolute of golden ratio, you can\u2019t forget about it. Therefore, the goal for each of us was to create a perfect shape.\nA kind of monument commemorating the way we traveled. However, the matter it was no longer so obvious for the young.\nThose who knew only the existance in three-dimensional plane, had no respect to nothing.\nThey didn\u2019t care about the stories told by elderly and began making their own divisions. Cutting blocks in a random way, they have completely ambandoned the values. The sacred ratio and our history were completely forgotten.\nApparently we didn\u2019t need it anymore. Youngest were saying the new times need no values. They continued to construct but without any plan. They didn\u2019t understand what to aim for. Slowly our existence began to fall into nothingness. Consumed by oblivion and indifference.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUD7haUgtrA2BGVyxYRmkncyTcbGLE2ftfexGkzmt4ec5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaQEh2UNJx5H3pmQ3j3yGmy7iD8xGJseM8t3bwdNejTZQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUD7haUgtrA2BGVyxYRmkncyTcbGLE2ftfexGkzmt4ec5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QvQiJY21xcfmPGZD7qqTGsJJEW3geuwt6"], "tags": ["monochrome", "geometry", "Bezmiar", "chapter", "dimension", "grayscale", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
