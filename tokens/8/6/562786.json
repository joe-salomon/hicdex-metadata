I will burn the uncollected on December 31st. \n\nThe project \u201cThe Man & The Wall\u201d is composed of 4 pieces. It was made entirely from a single photo of my shadow.  Mixed digital and analog processes were used, with an experimental approach - such as printing, cropping and torning, distorting in scanner, and digital manipulation. This is an intuitive expression of themes such as self-perception, dualities, projections and psychological pain. \n\nThis work was done a few years ago and is very personal, so I was a little reluctant to share.But at the same time it's one of the works I'm most proud of, so I decided to post it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZoJh2KG4CeMH1RdyXGPqHdqSvBSZSZmsfTcy1xmcBgkc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmShC8P5Gb2Mm1QcEU5NmisUSiHjd6UPcrj3WHYw4uUm1y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZoJh2KG4CeMH1RdyXGPqHdqSvBSZSZmsfTcy1xmcBgkc", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XN8V2Li1oMQwJUCb2HCGx4FhA54UyPEFN"], "tags": ["shadow", "duality", "digital", "analog", "scanner", "distortion", "experimental", "negative", "photography", "mentalhealth"], "extra": {}}
