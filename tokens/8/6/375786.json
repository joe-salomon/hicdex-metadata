I went back to point 0.\n\n.\nAcrylic on canvas", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVJ6ZKShV54izjipqEsHzTduhKAf82Zj4fqzjCYmZTvqu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQZM1MVt9R1UAWWDMiG4hcGbwziy9FjQgn3Qj9Wq7xExx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVJ6ZKShV54izjipqEsHzTduhKAf82Zj4fqzjCYmZTvqu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fqBenNG8mnkHEFpffZpGcARtecgsQCn2u"], "tags": ["WitchingHourOnHEN", "nft", "painting", "snake", "cave", "urterus", "feminine", "obsidiana", ""], "extra": {}}
