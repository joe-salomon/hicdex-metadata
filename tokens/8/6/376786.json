Afternoons spent playing Home Run, Bowling, breakout & so many more. We had a blast playing with our 2600.\n\nThis pic first came to me in a dream. I imagined I was standing on top of a massive joystick, looking down on the city far below. Just floating & opening my mind to possibilities. It was a nice dream. And joysticks still get me excited when I see them in a gaming store, or in my artist's imagination.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmebjhFM135gMZNJqgXTphNk2RSNkZW9FxmcVhitQgiR4g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVSKgX54HPx7vy99qNJuBro1L56SZWBRuTLdDLwhdnQJH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmebjhFM135gMZNJqgXTphNk2RSNkZW9FxmcVhitQgiR4g", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1X1ToMENirSHmj89avqhfxhRZpqiiXNohX"], "tags": ["joystick", "Atari", "gamers", "gaming", "play", "photographer", "photography", "videogames", "console", "2600", "dreams"], "extra": {}}
