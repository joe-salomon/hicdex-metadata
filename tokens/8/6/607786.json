{"__version": 1, "token_id": 607786, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The fool ", "description": "Equus Rufus Pixel tarot is the result of a collaboration between a professional illustrator and a psychoanalyst. Initially, it was conceived as metaphorical associative cards - one of the methods of psychodiagnostics and therapy.\n\nWhen looking at an image each person inevitably has some kind of association. And therefore the cards are called \"associative\". Thus, each card can become a visible metaphor of desires, anxieties, experiences or even fears of a person who has built their own association with what they saw. This explains the word \"metaphorical\" in the name of the cards. At the same time, we decided to preserve the classic tarot structure: Major arcana, The wands, The cups, The swords, The coins. There are 78 cards in total.\n\nEquus Rufus Pixel Tarot The fool Major Arcana 1\\78\n\nUPRIGHT: Beginnings, innocence, spontaneity, a free spirit\n\nREVERSED: Holding back, recklessness, risk-taking", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeoFh7siSkwQcMi3YMNCQzkWPgEQ1W8UBu2EyKsGEhz5V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbDXyU2FxcY75m1nwo56cFuQo1XeShv4kNM9xdzQKdr4g", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeoFh7siSkwQcMi3YMNCQzkWPgEQ1W8UBu2EyKsGEhz5V", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NnXtm8xJUwyp6ygeD9bTi6RXT4b8xWyT5"], "tags": ["pixelart", "tarot", "cards", "thefool", "collectibles", "majorarcana"], "extra": {}}
