Basically the light released by the plants here is actually the rest of the nutrients that the plants have consumed while the rocks themselves don't emit too much light but the light is compressed into a pigment that forms the basis of the beautiful colors on the rocks.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbFj51DqdCLTqkkvBhifqKxFE2emhMVHQfuQbm1pH1yV1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQu3G6qnxp3YkwmBSqetLFQ1zSyFH96eqZDoY2u6bFww4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbFj51DqdCLTqkkvBhifqKxFE2emhMVHQfuQbm1pH1yV1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1churhR6VtAr5cWWiKrAxMgBEY4uMi9AJt"], "tags": ["asia", "3d", "creature", "3dillustration", "metacreatura", "faturwz", "alienworld", "sci-fi", "indonesia", ""], "extra": {}}
