In terms that Photoshop crashed corrupting the psd file I was working since weeks in this single layer unique piece of digital art and making me losing all the work the day before the deadline. \nWhat? Didn't I saved a backup file? Yes I did and it also f*** crashed and corrupted in the same way. The backup backup was 2 weeks earlier, impossible to re do in half a day.\nI lost a 6000 dollars job cause of Photoshop and now I want to have my revenge trying to recover the loss using his own made art.\n\nAnd actually it looks pretty cool.
