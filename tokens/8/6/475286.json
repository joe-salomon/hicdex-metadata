A metaverse like no other.\n\nThe second replaced reality. All consciousness, the last shred of soul, were all converted into bits. \n\nThe third wave saw the collapse.

Bits and pieces of meta-reality.\n\n// loopymoon // 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbVLDS53vJsBNeHorp3U9j2PgesK1gzsxDiwyo6UTWdgv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPxnUiZrx8oiq1MCHuRN2wAbB9mXrP39EirbxEcFQbX2a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbVLDS53vJsBNeHorp3U9j2PgesK1gzsxDiwyo6UTWdgv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iiMWaRHGLTqawxnSMBYZmJ2byCBUBS3Vr"], "tags": ["loopyverse", "gan", "singularity", "metareality", "onchain", "consciousness", "metaverse", "monochrome"], "extra": {}}
