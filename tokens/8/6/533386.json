I've always been in love with the ocean and surf culture despite the fact that I've only been surfing once and I was absolutely terrible. I did grow up in the suburbs of upstate NY so didn't have much opportunity to surf growing up and as an adult I was really out of shape when I did try. It is VERY hard, and tiring. I thought I was gonna drown. That feeling is how I can often feel in a new space like crypto especially when you have doubts about your work. But you need to just keep on being yourself and eventually you will reach the right people.
