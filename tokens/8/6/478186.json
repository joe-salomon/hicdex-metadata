This fact, the popularity of blockchain and the desire for decentralization will lead in 5 years to the same result as bitcoin, I think. It will be on the radar, a lot of people will use it, it will grow in public acceptance, etc. \nAnd this will be aided by the fact that many are now talking about it publicly and doing some socially important actions via nft (like this project, with charity) so it all depends on people and us in particular.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQMvN1rVPLrLyUjHGnYMCmHc9hmiMYwtKNzZMq5kxodu1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNVvNWL8svsNo2XBE8AYMvN7a7aAbL8Q7N2pwnXpkdtur", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQMvN1rVPLrLyUjHGnYMCmHc9hmiMYwtKNzZMq5kxodu1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1cgT6gJt2YBBP4R9vnSYBaxre8E3PNk6wn"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
