Each flag created by the model is a unique amalgamation of all national flags combined.\n\nThe artwork is a vexillological reflection on the future of national identity and nationhood, representing an optimistic vision of a world in which humans transcend nationalism to global citizenship and stewardship.\n\nLearn more about the project at https://flags.ai\n\nAll benefits from sales of the Flags series go towards funding the Future Scouts (https://futurescouts.cc), a next-gen decentralized service organization.\n\n4096 x 2533 px png", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR6FKCyi6Mn6yC9R6tdEPTCPiwrqZBqAubw6Kvbh9iRhv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWTVfbbi61F29ZZJGqTu8VuqMXncZLSsso3mfJxPogpsS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR6FKCyi6Mn6yC9R6tdEPTCPiwrqZBqAubw6Kvbh9iRhv", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Z7Kbc2fnFM8itnJQAAJqPdtWeG9VniLpP"], "tags": ["symbols", "gan", "generativeart", "future", "emblems", "flags", "countries", "nation-state", "hilai"], "extra": {}}
