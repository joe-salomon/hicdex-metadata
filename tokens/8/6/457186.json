But... The future may just not happen.\nThey used to think that in the 2000s there would be flying cars and things like that. They really exist, but they are not part of people's reality.\nThe future is something uncertain, something unimaginable, the future is now, the future is today. What do you do to make today the best day? It sounds silly, but our life could end at any time. We have to live the future in the present, aim and do things in the present, in order to guarantee future things.\n\n3376 x 4548\n\n@gabbsmakemelive", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZT5MGnsqFUxPGUr1wARShxWXcZGLoo5ra8mwQgzXjTM7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcHpJ76K9if6q5wKEPxXy7fyEvHPbPwyKY8FmoqTP1p6t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZT5MGnsqFUxPGUr1wARShxWXcZGLoo5ra8mwQgzXjTM7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YdomAa87pkheLUTWf6VfgbsXJ8rufvUfJ"], "tags": ["future", "present", "life", "photomanipulation"], "extra": {}}
