Our regular long boarding model from Argentina named Marco. High on a peak of observation drawing fluency, now calling to mind looming peaks ahead that may be gently crested with increased logistics and resolve.

Rescued, documented, minted, preserved: Six pieces from 'in the zone'.\n\n2048 x 2048 px | measureless.io", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcw4MFJVVtAhT9ygqbUokPTLVrFQnymAEHPvb46KZ14yN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdCaqCmYKaLgxPLNYRkBtCn5ee9moiaYnPadW2oduU1gh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcw4MFJVVtAhT9ygqbUokPTLVrFQnymAEHPvb46KZ14yN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NAKns9HJ2bixQ4YwQBP3ayHT3BAVh776J"], "tags": ["Drawing", "Lifedrawing", "Lifemodel", "draw", "paint", "brush", "marks", "physical", "digital", "figurative", "figure", "human", "life", "neon", "nude", "painting"], "extra": {}}
