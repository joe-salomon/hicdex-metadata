My work  speaks of a \u2018spirit\u2019, that is ghosts, or specters. Ones that through direct experience and those around me affirms its existence in my house. An apparition arrives in for a second, yet its presence lingers in the mind. These set of paintings is a call back to that sensation, when glancing upon mundane objects in my house, there is a flash of a specter, one that forms itself from these things. The subject matter then are compositions of these objects around the house forming themselves to resemble those sensations, they are then documented as photographs I Bring physical of my work develop to digital world.
