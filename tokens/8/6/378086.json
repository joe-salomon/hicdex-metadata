The cause of death was suffocation, the bodies were otherwise completely unharmed, and John was declared missing. In the next 5 months, the state of Virginia was terrorized by a string of unusual murders, the victims seem to have been chosen randomly, they were \"stabbed a single time in the jugular\" and die shortly after, there seem to be a hand-shaped black mark around almost all of the victims' neck, reason for this is unknown.\nJohn Caleb is currently on top of the suspect list but finding him has proven to be nearly impossible, he continues to be unfound to this day.\n\nWork of @0nulshin", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdABRvjzTwKmc9H97RWWxiZKrMnjv4ovwHJsfbPQdCMoU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWHqcLiCdRYxK5dJoUibCUNCAdYXrMRdbYXYEVunnud6X", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdABRvjzTwKmc9H97RWWxiZKrMnjv4ovwHJsfbPQdCMoU", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fLm4PRo1Tvw6WaAs6J5rHD8ZVZsQs5AXi"], "tags": ["JohnnyBlackhands", "7deadlysinners", "character", "nulshin", "mono", "monochrome", "red", "characterdesign", "design", "human", "mystery", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
