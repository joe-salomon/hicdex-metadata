I think it\u2019s your turn to take a ticket for resting your body on time. I know you don\u2019t need to do this everyday, but what if you try to use this ticket only for one day and just do it?\n\nTake this ticket, if you want to get some rest, and I wish you will understand, how\u2019s your body\u2019s feeling when you just take a rest on time. Have a great day my friends.\nSee you on the next show.\n\nWarm regards,\nFionny Mellisa\n\n===\n\nAttention, dear my friends.\nI wonder if you get interested on my works, you can collect or purchase this works, then when you have my artwork, you have your rights of:\n- Posting or publish the work that you collect through your social media account by including the credit of the creator's name and the link to my social media account or the link that is linked to the creator. \n\n- Presenting this work at a digital exhibition event on a specific platform that accommodates it, while still giving credit to the creator.\n\n- Print this work in physical print format for personal display purposes (not intended to commercialise this asset)\n\n- In the end, you get your rights to grab this ticket and take a good sleep for just one day.
