Involving a series of tapping along the bodies' meridians, and hypnosis. I wound up freeze framing a traumatic event in my past, walked up to my younger self, and gave him the healing and safe space he needed but never got. My current \"future\" self, experienced the most profound healing after. Felt like a hug, three times from the future, present, and past. @Flipacadabra", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbLjr1ys5T3HK2VmDF8MAfkj4kT3UPSBU4o6jVn2eEs6Q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbNwWLY8gSQVARwAtAJ69gYzEHXta465aZivfEq6XmKnS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbLjr1ys5T3HK2VmDF8MAfkj4kT3UPSBU4o6jVn2eEs6Q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XF6RgvZDEE3QsHio9oEHf3SnrkBDM3sN2"], "tags": ["tapthreetimes", "eft", "matrixreimprinting", "therapy", "mentalhealth", ""], "extra": {}}
