{"__version": 1, "token_id": 357987, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Kyara Tyler - Pony and Kitten", "description": "It's hard to remember but I feel like I met Kyara because she came to my roommate's yoga class that she hosted in the photo studio we shared in Downtown LA. However it happened I'm glad it did and bummed we never got to shoot again. Timing just never seemed to work out. That was one busy playboy model let me tell ya. I think she was going to school for some medical something or other that I didn't understand a bit of while modeling all the time and learning to fly a helicopter among other things. The cat's name is Oliver and he never had a problem photobombing anyone working in the studio. \n\nThis is my 9th NFT. I've decided my initial offering this first two days in the NFT space will be 10 pieces that show the general feel of my work. After that I'm going to think on it a bit and probably limit my minting to a small weekly drop. As this is literally only my second day in the space, that is subject to change of course but I thought I would give at least somewhat of a roadmap of my plans. \n\nThank you to everyone who has shown me love so far. I really appreciate it and I can't wait to see where this goes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZsMAyUeJxBwd4hsFyS79zkWmhcZnkhuEaC7vVtF2mZ4L", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmephLySZqTwDZwsPv8vJL47iq4eLzdiLgK8iS2YSLcWgL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZsMAyUeJxBwd4hsFyS79zkWmhcZnkhuEaC7vVtF2mZ4L", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["woman", "erotic", "artnude", "nudity", "nudeart", "photography", "sexy", "photo", "nsfw", "keithallenphillips", "nude", "model", "beer", "nft", "blonde", "highheels", "heels", "cat", "kitten", "redlipstick", "lipstick", "playboy", "glamour"], "extra": {}}
