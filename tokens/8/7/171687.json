While the inner processes we perform can sometimes feel like repetitions of the same or return to the same, it is in fact a more spiral movent of the expanding self. With every deep gaze into ourselves and every process of deep inner exploration, we open new possibilities and trajectories of self, new perspectives towards inside and outside and therefore possibly entirely new self-narratives and understandings. The work is a reminder of the invisible power of repeating habit of contemplation, reflection and meditation.
