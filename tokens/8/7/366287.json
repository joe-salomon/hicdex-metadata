I bought it for 2 usd in Argentinean currency, and asked her permission to take it to HEN. Then I scanned it and retouched it digitally at home.\n\nJust as in HEN artists value and collect other artists, I thought it was nice to take that to the streets, and support local artists, not recognized.\u201d\n\n\nDigital signature: \"ToTeM\"\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeY29ErnJnKwqHJ3jjCfJfsvHmvHVbbHtCtMe3CaKawFj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR4nj7Bnad3hMve7vSoqAWvFkJPAbdzAATyxkMijrQCUZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeY29ErnJnKwqHJ3jjCfJfsvHmvHVbbHtCtMe3CaKawFj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1f3JJYcxT1WJViwJ7AziymK4ABDym83qUG"], "tags": ["vertical", "watercolor", "animal", "Illustration", "digitalart", "artist", "surrealism", "painting", "nature", "snake", "colour", "lucky", "eye", "green", "look", "woman"], "extra": {}}
