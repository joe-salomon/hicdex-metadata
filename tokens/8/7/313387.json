I apologized and was going to continue walking when he yelled \"HEY! I SAID DO YOU MIND?!\" I just tried to apologize again and keep moving, but another man decided to join in and take the side of the man in the photo.\n\"Don't do that shit here, take it back to California. This is Houston, we don't want that shit here\" all while the other man just continued to ask me \"Do you mind?!\"\nIt was all very confusing to me. Why were they so against me documenting every day life? Why did the second man feel the need to tell me to get out of Houston like he ran it? Why did he assume I was from California?\nThe anger and hatred these two people felt for me brought them together.
