It's inconceivable that someone can go through what we went through, have our bodies maimed, mutilated, and crippled as horrifically atrocious as what has been done to us, and still not kill ourselves - or even more terrifying to the untraumatized: us being happy. The \"If it were me I'd just kill myself\" crowd are always the types that couldn't pull a fucking trigger - a simple goddamn twitch of your finger and lights out - not if they tried.\n   1 in 30 suicide attempts succeed, 29 out of 30 at worst nothing happens, next worse is nothing happens and you get locked up against your will and (especially if you're a minority) get treated like cattle for a week or so, or are now living a worse life than what drove them to the attempt in the first place. You ever meet someone who survived a gunshot to the head? 35 surgeries and pain even Fentanyl can barely begin to relieve. Suicide prevention is more than copy pasting phone numbers to hotlines that call the police and endanger the lives of people in an already vulnerable place; your \"Depression is real\" shit after someone succeeds is insulting - are you trying to say you didn't believe it was real while they were alive? You fuck.\n   Suicide prevention is listening to your elders who went through torture and are still alive - ne'r immediately dismiss but a sentence of the happy torture survivor elder, for they are in their right to be called Sage. I'm a statistical anomaly in both how many attempts it should take to succeed, as well as I pulled enough strings to literally have a surgery invented for me to save my life from the unspeakable 11 hours of being tortured with knives and other tools by an elite millionaire that took 23 victims before me, and still to this day has not faced a single scratch nor professional record of a simple complaint against him; because of his status, his power and privilege, his hatred, his dehumanization of his targets, and his bloodthirsty greedy heart - threaten your life to sign consent forms to let him do whatever he wants to your body.\n  $250,000... That's how much putting me through double digits of magnitudes worse than rape every single moment for the rest of my life as my health declines and I'm on death's door bedridden and wheelchair bound with nothing left but the catharsis of turning art into tokens. Everything you own, every single body part you have, every single neuron capable of experiencing pain that'll put your old 10/10 down to a 2/10, every single way your labor can be exploited, or your body sold for sex, all it takes is someone willing to pay the price to entice the right person and EVERYTHING.. can be taken from you... \n   and if you think that this shit can't happen to you;\n  you're one of the easiest targets for people like this.\n Listen to your torture survivor elders.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXQeoCx5ASN7YhBWKr9H8c1Rio4ZBabN2GxQTbRonBkEY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPJRUsUma1TR6gdxh2sZoa7k98MdwW5xyXAKJRsHchHqD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXQeoCx5ASN7YhBWKr9H8c1Rio4ZBabN2GxQTbRonBkEY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WSB79B4pMAqzsfhqox2FzCRkf15ybZ4GD"], "tags": ["ptsd", "torture", "bounty", "cptsd", "trauma", "suicide", "suicideprevention", "queerelder", "violence", "angel", "angels", "angelm"], "extra": {}}
