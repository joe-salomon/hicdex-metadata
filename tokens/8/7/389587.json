Lost so much more than partial sight. The wounds heal slowly but the memories flash each night.\nThe cries and the screams now encoded into his soul.\nHis sword bent.\nHis ribs broken. \nHis adoration from his tribal brothers and sisters has never been stronger but he cares not.\nHe no longer understands the reason for war.\nHe has seen sons of men younger than him lose their lives.\nHe can no longer explain but he is decorated a hero. \nAn adorned King.
