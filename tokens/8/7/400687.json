It jumps across the water using its wings, hence its name.\n\nIt was blamed for problems ranging from snapping fishing lines to eating livestock or even fishermen.\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNc9mMkdPRBV7wJyuKPQP4mun5oKfD9UNrNpCpTkAGAL9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdcpxfM97jdw9LRU7M2DvX5mYPQyMxPcbK4BdyT4tciSW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNc9mMkdPRBV7wJyuKPQP4mun5oKfD9UNrNpCpTkAGAL9", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fdyejDESzzH8wiVq6WBBJnfyPdCN5xBjn"], "tags": ["digital", "collectible", "monsters", "mythological", "mythology", "animation", "card"], "extra": {}}
