I've been a casual gamer for most of my life. My parents wouldn't buy me a Nintendo but I did have a Game Boy and I LOVED Metroid 2. Fast forward almost 30 years and a new Metroid finally came out for Switch and I LOVE IT. The game is everything I could ever want... except there's no Spider Ball. I also have always kinda had a crush on Samus.
