According to the Greek mythology, Bia is the goddess of corporealize-ing of power and violence. The Bia series came up during my work of what an image represents. Is a photograph that is transferred to digital media is a residue remaining, or is it an image that offers a generic simulation to reality? Image is what arises as a result of traces. This trace emerged as a movement of light, an evidence of existence, from the object to the machine at a certain point in time. The material that the image is imprinted on is seen as a prerequisite of it reflecting the reality in a \u2018correct\u2019 manner. What gains importance is not the trace itself, but the meaning attributed to it. The Bia series focus on the meaning attributed to the image. While photographs transferred to digital media get manipulated and visualize the medium, they don\u2019t do this independent of the image.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYZd6cr9W3Qa3oyJJcakQi4yQ1XkMwq4bkSLWNrmNu6E4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSRNM1n1bfKdxiRx2UqDzJ8z1zCnjHLTNSwFj7LNSrmFK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYZd6cr9W3Qa3oyJJcakQi4yQ1XkMwq4bkSLWNrmNu6E4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eK87qXNcC6pXuMoWsmbBBCqy7NAnUsRPF"], "tags": ["digitalmanipulation", "elif\u00f6ner"], "extra": {}}
