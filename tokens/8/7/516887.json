{"__version": 1, "token_id": 516887, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Gliderworld", "description": "Playing with chemical potentials here rather than advection. Each pixel has a set of affinities for the 16 different materials which are determined by patterns in the local neighborhood. Materials attempt to jump to random nearby sites, but the jump is only successful if the affinity in the new place is higher than the old. Because the affinity patterns change as a result of the jumps, the system doesn't end up having a stable equilibrium, and oscillators, gliders, and spiral waves can exist. This is a particularly long run at a lower than normal resolution to highlight the long-term organization of the various gliders. / @ngutten\n\n1024 x 1024 mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmemRGyr97poVsnYy4vd4TfFuxgNXkLEj8bXM5MUTUWMmp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUqKxG2RpveMziLZCqeS9Hx2aoakAQg8WSX3GWrFeA3qu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmemRGyr97poVsnYy4vd4TfFuxgNXkLEj8bXM5MUTUWMmp", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["video", "simulation", "cellularautomata", "gliders"], "extra": {}}
