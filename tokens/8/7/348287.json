I make heavy use of the video synthesis library `vsynth` by Kevin Kripper, and time the period of all synthesis inputs to produce a perfect loop. This is the longest loop I have minted thus far.\n\n+ 1080 x 1350 60s looping mp4 captured in real-time from a max8 patch\n+ Source code can be hunted down at github.com/depatchedmode\n\n~ @depatchedmode", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmczVfdzA9M7BRC46UJQyEkCKJqtKyahu1nDLua2oCB8RY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV71NiUcxZVVCftcDMWsF3EkpSMdU2Q6NMDAQLeN7tGoH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmczVfdzA9M7BRC46UJQyEkCKJqtKyahu1nDLua2oCB8RY", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iriVRaQWaU97xwzxXZbmNREKm332MuixZ"], "tags": ["loop", "generative", "vsynth", "max8", "videosynthesis", "feedback", "colorful", "trippy"], "extra": {}}
