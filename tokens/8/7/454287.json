He is the only one qualified to judge the worth of all things.\n\nAnd if whatever trees upon the earth were pens and the sea [was ink], replenished thereafter by seven [more] seas, the words of Allah would not be exhausted. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. (Quran 31:27)\n\nThe revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
