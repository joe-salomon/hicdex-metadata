Check the other cards you have pulled to give you an indication as to what is surfacing. What\u2019s on the inside needs to be expressed on the outside, what is deep down below wants to be expressed above. \n\nLet it surface \n\nWhatever it is, whether it\u2019s something you need to get off your chest, something you need to say to someone or a piece of work you need to create. Our lives are a reflection of what\u2019s going on inside of us and if you are holding back or repressing something for whatever reason that will be reflected in your life.\n\nIt\u2019s just below waiting to push through. It wants to surface and so it will surface. It\u2019s coming up out into the light of day,  let it through and out and up. It's part of you and it wants to express itself above ground and out in the open. Let it.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP4Rv6n3e7FviAZdPjgaMtLZrUiPxErhr9HvhRAegkG4h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTDeQ3jAkNiCuZA65yL3yr4KrHuCHULjLhpqt9vvVtZKt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP4Rv6n3e7FviAZdPjgaMtLZrUiPxErhr9HvhRAegkG4h", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
