I remember going to pick it up from their place and their kids were super bummed because they liked playing in it, we said we would give it a good home. I lived in here multiple times, most recently before the fires and it was pretty shabby, but it was my little home. Aluminum melts at around 660 degrees Celsius. I recall hearing the flames that tore through here reached something like ~1100 degrees Celsius. Imagining my little home turning into a flowing puddle of goop, while the windows rolled up into little glass burritos and the bed, my clothes and random things disintegrated into ash still isn't something I can actually visualize. What would that even look like.. the mind boggles as the heart tries to recalibrate. The shear terrible beauty of physics colliding with our man-made things.\"\n\nPhotography by Jay Moon, during the Australian wildfires; November 2019.\n#10 of 15.\nAll funds generated go toward the ongoing recovery.
