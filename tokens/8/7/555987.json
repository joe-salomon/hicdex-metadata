{"__version": 1, "token_id": 555987, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "I NEVER MIND A NAIVE REMIND.", "description": "What makes this work so unique is that its all a self-contained anagram sentence. In, \"I NEVER MIND A NAIVE REMIND\", every letter connects back into the same sentence, but to the latter half of it. We can see so much happening here. From the word MIND staying together and reforming with an \"ER\" from \"NEVER\" to make the word REMIND to the letters \"V\" and \"R\" not even moving in terms of overall placement. There are literally hundreds of thousands or millions of these combinations in English. To say these are fun to make would be an understatement. The time it takes to make these seems like time stands still and the universe is within my mind. If you've never tried to make an anagram or did any wordplay whatsoever, try it. You never know what that will lead to.
