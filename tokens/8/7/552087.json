{"__version": 1, "token_id": 552087, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Dark energy", "description": "Dark energy makes up approximately 68% of the universe and appears to be associated with the vacuum in space. It is distributed evenly throughout the universe, not only in space but also in time \u2013 in other words, its effect is not diluted as the universe expands. The even distribution means that dark energy does not have any local gravitational effects, but rather a global effect on the universe as a whole. This leads to a repulsive force, which tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe. The rate of expansion and its acceleration can be measured by observations based on the Hubble law. These measurements, together with other scientific data, have confirmed the existence of dark energy and provide an estimate of just how much of this mysterious substance exists.\n\n1200x1200 - Animated loop GIF\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTg1Xk7M5WCpA8asumexu77P5a5QYLzA13gR79iT1rvTs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTg1Xk7M5WCpA8asumexu77P5a5QYLzA13gR79iT1rvTs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTg1Xk7M5WCpA8asumexu77P5a5QYLzA13gR79iT1rvTs", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WgYpFP6A18hHJFsjd8PuW9XrAqeQC1jrx"], "tags": ["gif", "techno", "pixel", "generative", "punk", "generativeart", "animated", "pixelart", "code", "animatedgif", "electro", "glitch", "vermine", "javascript", "cosmic", "cypherpunk", "video", "art", "Black", "White", "Monochrome"], "extra": {}}
