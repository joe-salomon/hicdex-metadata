Noise is taken from circular motion on a 2D noise field with its own radius and offset. These values are mapped onto a range of colours according to one of seven different algorithms, and rotation is added to produce interference patterns with a choice from eight rendering modes.\nThe initial seed for this loop of 300 frames is 285108, which selects function 0 with offset (-65.0, -23.0), range (-7.0, -3.0), and function 3 with offset (-35.0, -5.0), range (-2.8000011, -7.0). Noise is produced from sampling points on an ellipse at co-ordinates (-57.0, 19.0) with diameters (7.0, 1.0). The three formulae are combined using algorithm 4 with hue values starting at 168 with range 325. The grid is 181 units square.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmecr7k5cDbTmuitAZeto9GWtLDrqRJ2AP2paGf26q1ysz", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmecr7k5cDbTmuitAZeto9GWtLDrqRJ2AP2paGf26q1ysz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmecr7k5cDbTmuitAZeto9GWtLDrqRJ2AP2paGf26q1ysz", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VjCS2jiBTVPSEoYzJ79KkbYV5QbFJxuf3"], "tags": ["noise", "loop", "processing", "grid", "285108"], "extra": {}}
