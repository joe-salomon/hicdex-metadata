My own art has reached this level and I want to start sharing it with the community. To me these images are fragile and nearing collapse, they feel unstable and at the same time, something beautiful has emerged. I named this KaleidoBot, because my good friend says that it kinda looks like a bot, and that's pretty cool. Made with VQGan+Clip, and evolved in After Effects.
