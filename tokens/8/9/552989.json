I've been working on Coca-Cola design work for just about the entirety of my Design career. Our studio, and Coke are both based in Atlanta and we have been doing business with them far longer than I have been working there. Because of that I am VERY fond of the history of Coke and the history of the icon and during all my travels if I see an interesting piece of Coke advertising I ALWAYS take a look and often take a photo. This specific sign was in New Orleans and we were visiting for Mardi Gras. It's a very common thing for me but I end up taking numerous photos of the fantastic things going on around me and still end up being drawn to the typography and the Coca-Cola ephemera.
