{"__version": 1, "token_id": 462189, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "photo_scan_#10", "description": "A detail scan from the Romanian artist Dan Palade's studio that is transformed into his personal underground/playground. In this one we can see details of one of the 2nd room with brooms and scoops that were place in the space. With minimal interventions on the walls of the space, he embraced that old factory underground and added sculptures, paintings and personal objects in there transforming it into something totally different, a time capsule in constant deterioration by the elements. My approach at the time was to use photogrammetry as a medium that will store the underground and let the user explore it as it was in that phase. The various artifacts on the floor were obtained by flooding the underground while making the photoscan. This is the second of 4 special editions. 10/10, part of the 100 scans series, Timisoara, Romania 2018. This being the 10th work will be minted in 10 editions.
