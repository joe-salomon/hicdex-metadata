Both are symbols of resurrection. \n\nThe Sema with the greatest significance to the Mevlevi order is the annual celebration of Mevlana's (or you may know him as \u201cRumi\u201d) marriage to god (death), also called Seb-i Arus, meaning Nuptial Night or Night of Union. \n\nApproximately 750 years old, the Mevlevi Order is a living tradition (personally I doubt this part) based on the teachings of Rumi, also known as Mevlana, who is perhaps Turkey's most celebrated poet.
