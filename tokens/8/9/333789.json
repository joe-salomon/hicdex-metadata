The creation process is not much different from that of a sculptor who gradually reveals his work of art as he chisels it into the stone. While the natural movement of his hand highlights lines, hollows, and protrusions to reveal the overall esthetic of his artwork, I only used image filters. The organic form gradually appeared before my eyes without my drawing it. It was always there, dormant, hidden within the abstract gray noise; my search for it was merely a tuning of the instrument where it originated.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmavhK5tbu1pK4xUUoZhWKPjJcStNBB4Z4GHYNqsenyuVd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTrgGdHJsbhKPK4cH4icVodPNzkCd4qgj3ZxhvNbBFWvK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmavhK5tbu1pK4xUUoZhWKPjJcStNBB4Z4GHYNqsenyuVd", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Uo5Aufk4ewh9CJFQiAyHyVC7wdGY5yEQG"], "tags": ["digital", "life-form", "noise", "creation", "orb", "experiment", "aesthetic", "black", "organic", "avatar"], "extra": {}}
