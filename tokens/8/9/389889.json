I wanted to see how 2 sets of them affected each other. The best example I could think of to represent in text form would be the concept of auroras, which are luminous atmospheric phenomenon appearing as streamers or bands of light sometimes visible in the night sky in northern or southern regions of the earth. By using specific hues at certain intensities, we reach a point of saturation overlap where it matches the backgrounds' saturation point. The effect creates an ethereal ghost diagonal line, which reminds me of how auroras streak through the sky. This also infuses a meta quality to the work where the word aurora becomes the aurora itself.
