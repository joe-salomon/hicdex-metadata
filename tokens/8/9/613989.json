This reflects the need of space away from chaos, for the Chinese poets and painters who retreated to the mountains after the fall of the Tang Dynasty. Back in that era, in a reality dominated by chaos and war, humans could still escape to the mountains.\n\nBut where would the escape be in the hyper-real world all around us? French philosopher Jean Baudrillard in his controversial essay The Gulf war did not take place, states that \u201c\u2026the war is not measured by being unleashed but its speculative unfolding in an abstract, electronic and informational space\u2026\u201d (1995, p. 56). This does not mean that the war is not real in the sense of not having \u2018actual\u2019 consequences.
