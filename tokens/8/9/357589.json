{"__version": 1, "token_id": 357589, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Caprice Elise - Gulf of Mexico", "description": "Caprice has zero inhibitions. I shot this in my hometown of Pensacola, FL. Doing nudes outdoors there always makes me a bit nervous. Small town values and whatnot:) Not a problem for Caprice though. Probably one of the most free spirits I've ever met and I'm lucky to have got to shoot her a few times now. It's funny, neither of us live in Pensacola anymore, me mostly in California and her in France I believe, but we've managed to randomly show up in Pensacola at the same time without even planning it a couple of times now. Can't wait until the next time:)\n\nThis is my 6th NFT. I've decided my initial offering this first two days in the NFT space will be 10 pieces that show the general feel of my work. After that I'm going to think on it a bit and probably limit my minting to a small weekly drop. As this is literally only my second day in the space, that is subject to change of course but I thought I would give at least somewhat of a roadmap of my plans. \n\nThank you to everyone who has shown me love so far. I really appreciate it and I can't wait to see where this goes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmduPmAL7dxdHsgvbsC3CrAf7dwLjVKAuDREpSi9VyBKeE", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4Tjn5ARaDwSE4KK3vvRNJVHNDs1Q8wGaqQZRMhKMrjR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmduPmAL7dxdHsgvbsC3CrAf7dwLjVKAuDREpSi9VyBKeE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["nudity", "nsfw", "model", "nudeart", "bnw", "nude", "photography", "keithallenphillips", "nft", "woman", "photo", "blackandwhite", "artnude", "moody", "wet", "sexy", "erotic", "eroticawater", "ocean", "beach", ""], "extra": {}}
