Both were originally drawn as a colouring page for Sunny's Patreon and coloured separately by Sunny to illustrate how versatile each page really is.\n\n\"Bathing In The Blood Of My Enemies\" features a blonde, caucasian girl with red eyes, bathing in a black bath tub full of bloody bubbles. The wallpaper in the bathroom is grey and features skulls and flowers. The piece is a juxtaposition between a cute girl and violence, and the concept of partaking in self-care for good mental health.
