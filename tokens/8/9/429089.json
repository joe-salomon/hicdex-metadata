She is glamorous, beautiful, certainly carrying. A tropical, Caribbean sense of style, clad in headgear that your mind recognizes as possibly pineapples or palm trees. You pause and look closer. Is she... Does she resemble a tall palm tree, majestically towering over mankind? Or is she perhaps styled like a royal pineapple, firmly facing tropical winds, her hair in constant, billowing motion? Perhaps. It depends on what you see in this artwork. Imagination brings her into our brains and makes us want to know her story and share her story. What is her story?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRUcJFPZPDFqyWMCcBxiMZmvUb3du3U4KkDuPRE7Tqcz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUsg5pbksgwUqRggZ8dBpDchtnLpTi9K3nSSiEpQxBHCZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSRUcJFPZPDFqyWMCcBxiMZmvUb3du3U4KkDuPRE7Tqcz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1X1ToMENirSHmj89avqhfxhRZpqiiXNohX"], "tags": ["woman", "mystery", "fashion", "glamour", "pineapple", "headgear", "hat", "palmtree", "tree", "tropical", "palm", "Caribbean", "islands", "hollywood"], "extra": {}}
