No one knew exactly what or why they appeared. All they knew is that the wailing coming from within kept them up at night, shaking in their covers.\n\nOne brave recipient picked up their pumpkin, and upon examining, saw the numbers \"11 1 21\" carved in the bottom. Unfortunately, he didn't get to ponder too much more, as he was immediately killed in a freak bolt of lightening. \n\nCoincidence? \nPerhaps.\nWhat fate will become of those who hold this pumpkin in their possession?
