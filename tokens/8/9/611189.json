{"__version": 1, "token_id": 611189, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Taiku 30122021 \"The Forest of Query\"", "description": "Taikus are visual poems that tell the stories of a once upon a time colony in a magical winter forest, where settlers had to swim in the \"Lake of All Problems and Solutions\" to find their destinies written on Sory\u2019s, the only-born-in-water tree, leaves.\n\nVisitors to the forest, like the free thinkers and outcasts, who had settled at the colony, had to confront themselves with the dark forest inhabited by challenging creatures without gender or race, partly human, partly mythological, and partly beast, to face their deepest fears, demons, and concerns before embracing what Sory had to offer them. \n\nAll creatures and environments that came to life in the virtual world developed from Origami-like folded photographs and were sculptured in a remote studio in the dark winter forest at the Mac Dowell Colony of Arts in Peterborough, NH, USA. The analogue creatures were later transformed into the digital world and could be experienced with an Oculus headset.\n\nSoundscape by Hutch Demouilpied\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmae4EHaTZUiaoi2kRMnyXD26AWZiCSTbUEqsy23HBVTR4", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmajph4TogQfSFpweRDjWmpDMAe9B7TwWLKJJL5s1C2NZP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmae4EHaTZUiaoi2kRMnyXD26AWZiCSTbUEqsy23HBVTR4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hYBZGymM52REtwaDfb9Cy3GzzZbsyY7si"], "tags": ["Origami", "digital", "forest", "winter", "snow", "creature", "magic", "climatechange", "nature", "beauty"], "extra": {}}
