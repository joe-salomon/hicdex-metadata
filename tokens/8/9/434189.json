He hears everything and sees everything. He pays attention to every supplication, invocation, listening to all who reach out to him. Whether we speak loudly or in secrecy he hears every word.  \n\nAnd [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael, [saying], \u201cOur Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed You are the Hearing, the Knowing. (Quran 2:127)\n\nThere shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. (Quran 2:256)\n\nAnd you did not kill them, but it was Allah who killed them. And you threw not, [O Muhammad], when you threw, but it was Allah who threw that He might test the believers with a good test. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing. (Quran 8:17)\n\nO you who have believed, do not put [yourselves] before Allah and His Messenger but fear Allah . Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
