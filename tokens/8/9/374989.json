There is a need. It is time for you to release yourself from the limitations of your current structure whether it be physical or mental or both. No matter \nhow beautiful your structure is it no longer serves you. Take what you have learned from it and move on. Move from side to side, squirm your way out. If you have to squeeze and push then do it. \nWhen you\u2019re free jump around and move on down the road. Feel the joy of freedom, the release, the correctness, the flexibility and the peace.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV5ehWyjyDH1WdTAsVuLUXuDYBWVWBSq6LWeRpfFFLbX5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZjNQMVkYjE3uYyavNkQt5B2HBiViBsxb2ech3x4uYNCr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV5ehWyjyDH1WdTAsVuLUXuDYBWVWBSq6LWeRpfFFLbX5", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
