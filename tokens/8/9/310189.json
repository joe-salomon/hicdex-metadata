I called it Transmorfism. It is in its early stage, but I want to share this process with you.\n\nThe rule of Transmorphism #2. We live in a world that is constantly and rapidly changing and does not have a permanent shape. Transmorphism declares that shape exists, but it consists of particles that changing constantly, so the form is unclear. The shape follows deep nature processes. It imitates digital processes, as well, because the world is already much digital, and it is impossible to separate the natural from the digital. This rule also can change at any time. It must evolve.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU5WoiJtY7Q9Yvk1B3qXGGsncoGJMoSw6TX61GMk2PFAE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVAD51B323uf2KNEXuGc9V3bxEsedpnBYzEqpYRKauvGK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU5WoiJtY7Q9Yvk1B3qXGGsncoGJMoSw6TX61GMk2PFAE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gyWHF2DJknpmPmAkQrfyhPbTeetGMjPb1"], "tags": ["transmorfism", "glitch", "datamosh", "generative", "abstract", "psychedelic", "ai", "experimental", "post-internetart", "neon", "color"], "extra": {}}
