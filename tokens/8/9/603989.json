There are dates that make negative emotions intensify.  For example, before the death of a loved one, Christmas reminds us that that person is gone and this increases our sadness.  We see ourselves observing a chair that is not going to be occupied, surrounded by others that are.\n Currently, in our society there is a kind of obligation to always be happy that has been greatly accentuated since the arrival of social networks.  Added to this are our \"should of\" thoughts that force us to feel emotions that we do not have at this time.\n My intention with this collection of \"Absences\" is to reflect with images this feeling, very accentuated on this occasion due to the pandemic that we are experiencing and that has made us miss many loved ones.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc1euNnrSB84vQ9Xo1A3QPxzas3HjPk8gm5GycqaqLL2C", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQPPMoXQ33tt4v9woV2VuqfhgZQV7eQh7dvAzvnARcGaW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc1euNnrSB84vQ9Xo1A3QPxzas3HjPk8gm5GycqaqLL2C", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i1xzPoyH4g2T8YiC5MAFFo2paHEdAYgDh"], "tags": ["illustration", "collagedigital", "art", "digitalart"], "extra": {}}
