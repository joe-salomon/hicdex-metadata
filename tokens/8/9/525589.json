From the other jug she pours a fire onto the land.\n\nfrom Arcana Collection\n/ by @_loscaballos\n/ 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVZJr7KN8FxtoSXs98aAurA1UQvkEo4jpFAmHaqr1Y5Mm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWiZMqbzQEvhLWttNz1bXajZhC72tUPFjuX6FAV1TJWiv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVZJr7KN8FxtoSXs98aAurA1UQvkEo4jpFAmHaqr1Y5Mm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ga8QT9cyBGFumizGgK77uH5VcyaccC8en"], "tags": ["star", "arcana", "illustration", "tarot", "loscaballos", "card"], "extra": {}}
