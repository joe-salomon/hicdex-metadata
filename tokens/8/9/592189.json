I built it up, now I take it apart, climbed up real high, now fall down real far. No need for me to stay, the last thing left, I just threw it away. I put my faith in god and my trust in you. Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do. I'm the one without a soul, I'm the one with this big fucking hole. No new tale to tell, twenty-six years, on my way to hell. Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad-luck, fist fuck. Don't think you're having all the fun. You know me, I hate everyone. Wish there was something real, wish there was something true. Wish there was something real, in this world full of you. I want to but I can't turn back. But I want to.\n\nOil, canvas, madness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPuZe2dRqGZyYyHFUhxJm5UinfsEVrV4e8kgKYFdJmUVG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPuZe2dRqGZyYyHFUhxJm5UinfsEVrV4e8kgKYFdJmUVG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPuZe2dRqGZyYyHFUhxJm5UinfsEVrV4e8kgKYFdJmUVG", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1ccAo4Gkpk76mXMBmBMfUpEZSRA7fERBr9"], "tags": ["darkart", "art", "nun", "sexy", "girl", "dark", "glitch", "tezos", "gif", "hollow"], "extra": {}}
