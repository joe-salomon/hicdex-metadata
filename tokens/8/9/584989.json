She had hired me to photograph her Bulma Bunny cosplay. Ever since then she\u2019s been hiring me to photograph other cosplays, and the result is usually spectacular. I saw a Doctor Strange cosplay she put together and showed off on social media. I loved it so much that I wanted to photograph her in it, so I invited her to the studio for a fun photo session. For this particular shot, I wanted to emulate a style that Lindsay Adler frequently uses, casting shapes onto her subjects using light. I made a triangle set in foam board and pointed a light through it to create the shape, and it really helped bring out the cosmic, mystical nature of the character.
