Strangely they've followed me on my journey in life and are misunderstood, like me. Unknown to many they are ecosystem engineers helping forests regenerate by transporting seeds and eating insects that harm crops. They are also friendly when befriended. So, I\u2019ve created a fun collection of 100 crows to change people\u2019s perceptions as the planet needs crows to fight against climate change and food shortages. #CannyCrows\n\nPlayfully created by Sian Victoria \u2013 find out more about the artist @SianVictoriaUK on Twitter or check out my full NFT collection on Instagram @Sian.Victoria.NFT\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb8pcCTjiLWVzy7nBPPjsQTpZg364VnrkmZoM7CQhYVzN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUo2PZhytDhJG7dyZ48FRCrfYuBRMwcX3SzFVn1MTWpEQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb8pcCTjiLWVzy7nBPPjsQTpZg364VnrkmZoM7CQhYVzN", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZFKYRijD15hh8tCPojQ2N7XinUpYov5ES"], "tags": ["SianVictoria", "cannycrows", "cannycrows", "collection", "collections", "birds", "animals", "fun", "funny", ""], "extra": {}}
