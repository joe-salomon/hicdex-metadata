I believe that luck is relative, can come from anywhere and cannot be separated from human efforts to make all things that were originally abstract become real. So everyone who tries will surely find his luck at the right time.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPh9HmgmJ1jDKgxZbyjjfzeCwbBpsKaYxekuQmxACq3Gr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWWn5XYDQuKWGsWwvE5RxiGks6Pd5iSPapp6xETE4kAhz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPh9HmgmJ1jDKgxZbyjjfzeCwbBpsKaYxekuQmxACq3Gr", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1YLxReRghzVvk2X99CSQREvStF2RuhcnQX"], "tags": ["DoodleArr"], "extra": {}}
