Nobody was able to figure out why or how it got there.\n A year later, as I was entering planet Velra to grab a cup of calidum chocolte, It really was there, the pillar.\n Just then, 3 beam of light quickly shines through the holes in it. And at the blink of an eye, what once was planet Velra, is now just a big blank space asteroid. Everything on the surface disappeared. Towns, cities, even forests and rivers, they are all gone.\n\nNOTE 02\n From my observation, the pillar will be activated every exactly 1 year. Everything on the planet will disappear leaving only trails of atoms orbiting the planet at extreme speed. I will call this pillar: The Null Monolith.\n\nSPECULATION\n Those atoms only appeared after the first activation of the pillar. That means the pillar might not make everything disappear, only turned them back into their initial elements.\n\n-- ENDLOG ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ4ssQiAp6a53rGT9nwpKfzGZWt35ytYzbYTqJ5U7HxPH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQDknMQLo9ska7gEamfDGXUrn2Uha4Ekb3v8Ue3jgvppE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmWwMDG7P84cAKU1mgkUDjYTdMdabEYVVaM7z7rt7cRpr3", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ4ssQiAp6a53rGT9nwpKfzGZWt35ytYzbYTqJ5U7HxPH", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1S65gJ4Du1KT3FCQiLeop65bNkRTNy5ZXn"], "tags": ["mysterious", "discovery", "mystery", "galaxy", "pillar", "minimal", "monolith", "null", "space", "relic", "audio", "planet", "velra", "3d", "deepspaceexploration", "exploration"], "extra": {}}
