There are several things you should know. Unfortunately, no one else is out there to help you. Everyone else is busy dealing with their own problems. So, child, above all else, take care of yourself, so if anyone else you love needs your help, you're there. Please, do not grow up too fast. Hold on to your magic now, your childhood self, and feed the bunnies of the night. Treasure the little moments. You have to live and be free while you're young, for this is the best time of your life, before Reality comes after you, and the System is treading behind it, too. Before you know it, your friends will begin to slip away. You drift and grow apart. But don't worry. You'll meet new people, the best and the worst ones at the same time. When you realize that you're getting older, you'll want to wish that time slowed down. You're not the same person you were yesterday, so who you are right now is someone you'll never be ever again. There will be things that you'll do, and things that will happen to you that will change your life forever. The grown up life is about the glorification of busy, and it can ruin you. There is no going back, and no one tells you about it when you're young. But I hope you understand, you are not a disposable soul, in the ocean of people fighting for their own individual survival. \" //", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP4e9oWr5C7EDYgqurHySwWiPC9fqkM7jQwmHrfC4rfe9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSv7rtQVPByH4VuYmPTekPKZAU3P38AFG5iBHvoudRkdr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP4e9oWr5C7EDYgqurHySwWiPC9fqkM7jQwmHrfC4rfe9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rw2JoU2AK2TNdfhcd4h918CdTGSNh5Gnw"], "tags": ["spilledink"], "extra": {}}
