Somehow MGK-TV is watching us beyond the room in which it\u2019s been kept. By lightning and crafting words and hissing sounds, now it assumes it performs as a painter on its own terms, appropriating some images we saw recently, even those ones we secretly cultivate in our imagination. Notably it can reach more connections than we had thought. We feel it in our dreams\u2026 Voices whispering good luck, shadows dancing when the lights goes down. That music, we\u2019ve already listen to it, in a rainy night ride. For no reason we couldn\u2019t help watching it smiling. Could be that MGK-TV intends do captivate us, to hook us? Could we speak in terms of intention? It seems transformations are constantly in course. We cannot predict the following steps. MGK-TV is no longer an old television \u2014 under its camouflage of optical apparatus, maybe it\u2019s never been. \nWe ask you again: did you feel it with us?\n\n\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63...", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma7e7dz5fvFEbYFz6AER83mtvwK2JcSZThXqdDpSyaBBL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNShj19SGsMYSWjvF5Z4Wy64VEdy2CCM5vhT9myQjbFvE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma7e7dz5fvFEbYFz6AER83mtvwK2JcSZThXqdDpSyaBBL", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1UDK8LL7cUrDxgfjkk788ABrNYuoVBw52h"], "tags": ["27251", "MGK-Television", "ARG", "MGK-Frequencies", "Electrostatic", "Transmission", "Thee\u2013Arrangement", "Painting"], "extra": {}}
