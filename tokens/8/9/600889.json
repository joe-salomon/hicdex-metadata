We studied architecture together and because of him I saw some crazy buildings and parts of buildings I would have never otherwise. Hitchhiking, lying to & sneaking past security, breaking in (and out) of places, and listening to a lot of great music together. He had Kendrick's DAMN tape weeks before it came out. He's a smart guy and lives off the grid in the desert now. Anyways, hopefully this NFT embodies whatever part of that energy you'd like into your life.
