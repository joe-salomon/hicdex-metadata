The result is visually depicted while listening to the audio signal source to juxtapose the digitization of the human experience and consider the abstraction of data into art.\n\nFractals were glitched and color modified with a MIDI soundtrack designed to modulate the audio signal generating the visuals.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf1uxSS9uMq6tJUwiuk4BJrZd93ELBip7UPmZuiXftaj2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPqepmYJ9PAN3XGyPxMaTUgWjsCUd2cjoJhgwBhn28jtK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf1uxSS9uMq6tJUwiuk4BJrZd93ELBip7UPmZuiXftaj2", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VChh1HhdBroffKUsxpC4AiRbKz8HmWhKt"], "tags": ["oscilloscope", "data", "blockchainsignals", "musicforrobots", "fractals"], "extra": {}}
