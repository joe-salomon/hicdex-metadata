The legend of the Lan\u00edn is a story worth knowing, so please be my guest and enjoy the tale/\n\nAtop the Lan\u00edn was Pill\u00e1n, a fierce but righteous god, guardian of nature. While trying to gather food and leather, a group of young Mapuche hunters chased a huemul herd way too far up the mountain, and right into Pill\u00e1n's domain. Seeing his beloved creatures getting killed, he unveiled his wrath: From the sky a violent storm, and from deep beneath the earth arose fire, lava and ashes, sprouting through the Lan\u00edn's peak and covering the land with its flaming fury.\n\nTheir hearts clenched with fear, the tribe asked the local chaman for help, but there was only one way to stop the chaos: sacrificing Huilefun, the Chief's daughter, into the volcano flames. Quechu\u00e1n \u2014a young and brave warrior\u2014 carried the princess to the highest peak of the mountain and left her to face her fate. With fiery eyes and majestic flight, a Condor descended upon the princess, clamping its claws around the young girl and rising right over the volcano's mouth, letting her fall into the pit.\n\nAs soon as Huilefun fell, the sky got full of clouds and a heavy snowfall covered the flames, soothing Pillan's wrath and dressing the Lan\u00edn with an everlasting white veil. Since then, its fire lies dormant, hiding the princess deep within the mountain.\nMany moons have passed since then, but even to this day, Huemul hunting remains forbidden.\n\n\n\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30 (@\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude32\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude30) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmebNit8EfceosqfkMbNvV25tW61FQ59rDBXSevzk6XSyy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRPxuABGJb4od7VysCwigNcixQy9kuxKqQKCP3Zs7Mwpu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmebNit8EfceosqfkMbNvV25tW61FQ59rDBXSevzk6XSyy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
