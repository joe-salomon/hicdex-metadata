I've been customizing designer toys for 15 years and despite yesterdays design also featuring some of my customs I thought today was only fitting to feature 2 Horror themed pieces that I've done over the years. Both Leatherface and the Dunny sketch of Michael Myers are from around 2008 or a bit earlier. And the photo is a double exposure of Buffalo NY, developed by me at The University At Buffalo from around 2002.
