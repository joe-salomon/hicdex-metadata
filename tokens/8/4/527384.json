In accordance with Egyptian custom, the distraught emperor initiated a cult venerating the dead youth, for the Egyptians believed that those who met such a death became assimilated to Osiris, god of the Underworld.\n\nOutside Egypt, numerous statues of Antinous were erected that represent him as a beautiful youth, often in the guise of Dionysus, a Greek god closely related to Osiris. This head is a good example of the sophisticated portrait type created by imperial sculptors to incorporate what must have been actual features of the boy in an idealized image that conveys a god-like beauty. The ovoid face with a straight brow, almond-shaped eyes, smooth cheeks, and fleshy lips is surrounded by abundant tousled curls. The ivy wreath encircling his head associates him with Dionysus, a guarantor of renewal and good fortune.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXfyVuzh8Y4zBGg9HCTbWoNUNg8tQnrVcd9Y9YDB4aEg4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmULanzsKdwdx7s7YEFPHina4B9HbshWxDwuFGrEyrEgQh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXfyVuzh8Y4zBGg9HCTbWoNUNg8tQnrVcd9Y9YDB4aEg4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MwbPYK7vbCUQ7ADdbvq8eYkiRBydxKzLk"], "tags": ["nft", "nfts", "nftcollector", "3d", "3dart", "blender", "cinema4d", "statue", "lights", "vfx", ""], "extra": {}}
