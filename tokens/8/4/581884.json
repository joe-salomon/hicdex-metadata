Since the beginning of record, Humans have worshiped perceived \"higher powers\" that manifested themselves as \"gods\", similarly rulers, convinced the populous that they were, chosen by, or were one of these gods. As humans evolved and became educated every generation believed less and less in the notion of gods among us. \"Royalty\" seemed to be the last bastion of human worship, even into the early 20th century, many still were in awe of Royalty, that inherited family rule. Then the latter 20th century gave us the new gods, \"superstars\" Elvis, Marylin, Michael Jackson, achieved godlike status with carefully manipulated personas and complete inaccessibility. It would seem Billelis's narrative to make us question this odd human trait is also packaged as it's cure. The digital world has facilitated human connection, information exchange, and accessibility, to enlighten all to the fact that we're all fallible, all human, all equal. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWpgqVUsQiGdxgWr7V4u97S4Ww4VNhgsc4cLFKfFUbwMi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNNcZ8kn4bNi6qDgATXWHmKDGX3NQeyCwxAFpdCbY6sNt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWpgqVUsQiGdxgWr7V4u97S4Ww4VNhgsc4cLFKfFUbwMi", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fCAg1JeNUoTEyUc73h7TwuiLSm1aR2Pjb"], "tags": ["3D", "animation", "billelis", "debut", "genesis", "god", "gold", "nft", "queen", "royalty", "skull"], "extra": {}}
