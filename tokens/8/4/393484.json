When Perla In\u00e9s spent thousands of hours practicing on the piano, Marla Reliquia rambled on and invented poems that she later recited at amateur poetry festivals.\n\nThey didn\u2019t call \"dead hours\" when they did something to support the interests of the other. They called it \"SISTERS\u2019 DOORS\u201d. Since they didn\u2019t have much time to spend alone, they used the Sisters' Doors to self-absorbed and develop as individuals, to be in their own rooms.\n\nWhen Marla became President of Morondanga Republik, Perla In\u00e9s turned her soul completely over to Peppology, a door that she never closed again.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUxoiq6smWAguYPXeBhXrLErrUoQY9fwKxaVSExqtQYCe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ76aRcGwAHDEhbZ83MJPVv3tQ7g8UsMunkSpuqLVYJKU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUxoiq6smWAguYPXeBhXrLErrUoQY9fwKxaVSExqtQYCe", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Stamps", "Sisters", "Siamese"], "extra": {}}
