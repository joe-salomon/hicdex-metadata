May 9th 2016. Was carpooling home from work and on 270 North bound a car on the side of the road was on fire. So, I zoomed in all the way and got the shot right at the second i wanted it to be. This has always been something I've loved to do and take pictures with an iPhone4. I swear the 4 was the best iphone ever made.
