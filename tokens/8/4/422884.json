While I am for the most part a photographer, I do sometimes use my own photos to create stencils which I then spray paint onto canvas. Each of these will be a 1/1 edition of a unique physical painting that lives somewhere out there in the real world. I used some of my stencils multiple times but each painting was a unique color scheme and the stencil painting process itself created a one of a kind  painting each time a stencil was used. In the future there will be one more version of this stencil minted.\n\nAs an added bonus, at the same time I will drop an NFT of the photograph this painting was made from. The buyer of this NFT will also get a copy of that NFT sent to them for free.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPgo4qa3BgrHxbv2hLCaiZxXoqDhXoE4SZwD1sWf7YMhn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNVuMrbLCwYtXu7LJf7JAaFSfmmwFd1SQbCW9zVALWv2j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPgo4qa3BgrHxbv2hLCaiZxXoqDhXoE4SZwD1sWf7YMhn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["photography", "keithallenphillips", "nft", "sexy", "artnude", "model", "erotic", "nudity", "stencil", "stencilart", "nude", "woman", "nsfw", "beautiful", "painting", "glamour", "mohawk", "nudeart"], "extra": {}}
