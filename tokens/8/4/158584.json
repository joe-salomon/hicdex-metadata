It reminds me of the spirit of adventure and wanderlust! It also reminds me of the time I realized how easy it was to get lost in the desert, with nothing around you but sand stretching for miles as far as the eyes can see, and a few decrepit marks of nature. The tracks made by the MPVs and our feet mean nothing, for they will soon fade away like the million of tracks left before ours.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcHriUKvZmP8DeotNt1HgWikRsfrUX87m5kA9zyAKZhbN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcHriUKvZmP8DeotNt1HgWikRsfrUX87m5kA9zyAKZhbN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcHriUKvZmP8DeotNt1HgWikRsfrUX87m5kA9zyAKZhbN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WsVTb7sYiMqxFvTJ5WezXHcvVwyTkFsCv"], "tags": ["PicEtNunc100", "Photography", "Traveling", "Dubai", "Desert", "Sun"], "extra": {}}
