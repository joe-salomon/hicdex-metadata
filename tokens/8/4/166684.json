It still holds a cult status and is fresh in the minds of all the 90s kids! I created this artwork using Adobe Photoshop. I drew his body structure nd uniform and then created 12 different versions of it. I have used some stock photos for masking some of these frames and the idea is to expose different sides of Shaktimaan and India. The normal caricature jpg image of Shaktimaan was one of the first work I ever did on Photoshop back in 2015 and now I have tried to enhance it so as to fly in the NFT market.\nResolution - 2100*2100; Size - 13 MB", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcV4yMJYXXSYBWbovHVoE962ZmUNCeEhbizityxHHK4we", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcV4yMJYXXSYBWbovHVoE962ZmUNCeEhbizityxHHK4we", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcV4yMJYXXSYBWbovHVoE962ZmUNCeEhbizityxHHK4we", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Lw7T2Yai5LbwVs4rzdTLNyzKThitQKaco"], "tags": ["photoshop", "hicetnunc2000", "illustration", "gif", "india", "superhero", "shaktimaan", "graphicdesign"], "extra": {}}
