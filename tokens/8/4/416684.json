It's slightly unnerving due to its seemingly simple process but also exciting as when you collect these numerous images yo can then do something unique with them. You return the new image to the strange entity known as the AI that created the GAN art. A surreal collaboration that embraces the creative equation 1+1=3 beautifully. Snowpixel.app is very much a leading platform in this sense and I invite you to give it a go, warning though it is very addictive!\n\nThis artwork is created from 2 GAN images which I used as a basic structure which I then digitally doodled over. The original GAN  images are completely lost now but in their place a new creation. As is always the case with things reduced to an abstraction invariably your eye seeks some way of understanding the artwork, some form of visual reference. To me I can see two ladies lying on a beach, one with a more dominating presence, hence QUEEN TAKES QUEEN.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbieyhj4H3uMSEjAhvtbgvGg6HVkrLzi2LczZsn1Mrit4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQivRfrPSRP3piLhgBb9Y2LTtBjBDmCgB2vRh1f3L9JWT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbieyhj4H3uMSEjAhvtbgvGg6HVkrLzi2LczZsn1Mrit4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VQQab8jZvSDdjTn3hpdc6tPsBYPQXGQbi"], "tags": ["Doodle", "doodleart", "art", "artist", "marccraig", "marccraigart"], "extra": {}}
