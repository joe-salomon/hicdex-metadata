This is a biomorphic NFT that is a real microbiome inspired by physarum mold transport (yes really) and evolving forever. It consists in 262K particles fired by 48 jets of molds that hits a grid of squares.\n\nAll evolutions might be slighly different due to data<->GPU timing. You can start/stop evolution (left click) to take snapshots.\n\nThis NFT is totally autonomous of NFT platform and IPFS. For owners, I can deliver a certificate and an independent package that you can save and re-launch out of platform forever.\n\nWARNINGS:\n- Reload if not loading, IPFS can time-out.\n- Best on computer with GPU. Don't hesitate to see it in bigger window up to 2K full screen.\n- On mobile, it's a video preview as it renders badly due to float precision issues in current WebGL implementation.\n\nThis NFT is unique and is part of Shape collection based on the same principles but with very different renderings. Keep up for next tokens.\n\nMore information on Readme https://github.com/naibdian/naibdian-collections/tree/main/physarum/shape\n\nYou can contact on Twitter @naibdian", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbUJz1TQ95xxUgFUj4my8EdiJichQPENnfgkziSbAUvUt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaRFgCGySdXakrpS4m9rwdPDTAruHNiMBir89HkeHs159", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbUJz1TQ95xxUgFUj4my8EdiJichQPENnfgkziSbAUvUt", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1PYADtd4JhgC1MmWYq7LHevu63bHwbWXg1"], "tags": ["biomorphic", "physarum", "live", "javascript", "square", "grid", "abstract", "particles", "webgl", "threejs", "generator", "animated", "genart", "generativeart", "artgen"], "extra": {}}
