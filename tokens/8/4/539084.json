I took this photograph on a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago in 2015. Back in my studio, I started to explore how I could balance the massive weight of an islands edge on the left using differing shapes and lines to the right. In the process, I realized there could be many successful outcomes. And that there was no SINGLE image that best expressed a solution.\n\nWhile the base image is the same, each solution is a unique piece. \nPhysically printed, allowing studio dust and fingerprints to accumulate, adding a sense of place and history in the physical world. Then manipulated and scanned.\n\nThis is solution 4/4.*\n\n*COLLECT ANY 3 OUT OF 4 BY 11 21 21 AT 3PM PST \nAND YOU WILL BE AIRDROPPED A FINAL COLOR SOLUTION.\n\n5332 x 3999 pixels / original photograph taken on 08 29 15", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbxuvzA4brR4EdtRZVAmut3ouEtXT9osnM3tyZ7mix5ZN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRDkBGrnc3ExLgWiqo769JfPuCScEgRGQ3PjrYawmCFRE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbxuvzA4brR4EdtRZVAmut3ouEtXT9osnM3tyZ7mix5ZN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PsY6huVzWihab1EX1Axrtk72ip9qQHBCs"], "tags": ["Galapagos", "seascape", "typography", "blackandwhitephotography", "garyedwardblum"], "extra": {}}
