Konk has a hammer for every occasion, from his mallet for fighting large foes right down to a small toffee hammer that he uses for a little light torture and also breaking apart toffee.\n\nKonk\u2019s battle cry of \u2018It\u2019s Hammer time!\u2019 - inspired by a legendary piece of 20th century classical music that is still studied and revered by humanity even in this far-flung future - strikes fear into the hearts of all who hear it, shortly before Konk\u2019s hammer strikes them rather more literally and with rather more finality.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmck2oaBNHDhz9xCe3NVM9Lkbrhthf8q9LkvhZm1GJDoSQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWUVsRFLkn9m7MR5ywmd5LZmhd5pRsy9hxsDRKeJ3Kh4j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmck2oaBNHDhz9xCe3NVM9Lkbrhthf8q9LkvhZm1GJDoSQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["Vessels"], "extra": {}}
