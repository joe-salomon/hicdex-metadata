We will only know when we try. \nHowever, we need to do it fast, our only option is to do it right Here right Now.\n\nAnd even then, perhaps, doing our best is still no longer good enough..\n\n//Inspired by the current environmental & climate events around the globe, the cleanNFTs movement on H=N platform and a track from whities 030 by SOS Gunver Ryberg.\n\n//Made using java library through processing environment.\n\n//1200*800px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmToN8vigYL3TAp5MAbugkPao6Nxp2Rr3peeKLiEtuPFab", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmToN8vigYL3TAp5MAbugkPao6Nxp2Rr3peeKLiEtuPFab", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmToN8vigYL3TAp5MAbugkPao6Nxp2Rr3peeKLiEtuPFab", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZjSe3hSwrvwhywZg3QgQAnnGtHpnJsWDy"], "tags": ["savetheworld", "savetheplanet", "climatechange", "environment", "betterfuture", "generativeart", "creativecoding"], "extra": {}}
