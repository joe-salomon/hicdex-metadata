Working across the disciplines of painting and digital media, I make art with fire itself, using my work as a vehicle to raise awareness about the ecological perils facing the planet. The images in this collection were made in the wake of the 2019/20 Australian bushfires. I burnt a series of painted timber panels with a blow torch and pyrography equipment, photographed the work and then composited the images in Photoshop.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZZEGWivQxfZaVNNKr77o2oD8tDgFWnkfkfovKtqqPCeA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTkKo9MMd6uRU5fRahVH2zu46U9pxHijZq8LPztxUQRrv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZZEGWivQxfZaVNNKr77o2oD8tDgFWnkfkfovKtqqPCeA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Sbhub9pYs2ZikvYsSqZHtZg95UioGDQvY"], "tags": ["digitalart", "cleannfts", "climateart", "digitalart4climate", "climateemergency", "climatechange", "digitalartist", "climateartist", "TheTimeIsNow", "NFTCommunity", "tezosnfts", "cleannfts", "collectors", "climateartproject", "fire", "bushfires", "flora", "flowers", "nature"], "extra": {}}
