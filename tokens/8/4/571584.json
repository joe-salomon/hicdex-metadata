It was exhibited once and has been in my archive since. The Plugging Into Pleasure NFT series takes excerpts from the work. \n\nThe glitch was found by accident while downloading pornography, in particular WMV files. When played back in VLC these files allowed for a real-time and performative datamoshing by clicking and moving around the play-head of the timeline. Clicking rapidly would make the pixels flow across the screen obfuscating the intended images of pleasure for new images of pleasure. Perhaps videos true nature, that lives under all of our encoded images. All we need to do is listen.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ5eXwBicxpDhpNvAFCMiGKyB9qjRbD3jcvqEiCBpJ6jY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWeNj2B8ZnakyDcFKaLexQfxfMSR3iVi7wzNtE6co3YwU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ5eXwBicxpDhpNvAFCMiGKyB9qjRbD3jcvqEiCBpJ6jY", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eYdZXuh9MvXPGq3DGuNPCZRpTMJz1DEYV"], "tags": ["pleasure", "glitch", "datamoshing", "erotic"], "extra": {}}
