{"__version": 1, "token_id": 563284, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Received Too Many References", "description": "I'm always feeling that having a conversation with friends is a simple form of cheap entertainment. But unfortunately, yesterday I was bothered by a friend of mine, he stated that the topic of conversation would be good if it's not useless. He said it would be good to talk about our references and exchange value or information rather than gossiping and talking about our daily lives.\n\nI feel a little confused by that statement because I have been in that period. Having a perspective on what is being said should have value. But being that kind of person is no fun and more exhausting.\n\nWhat happened to me when I was consuming a lot of information but not exercising in any form of media. Only causes the information that I had collided and replaced between one and another.\n\nMaybe in the future, if I just finished getting new references and consuming them, I think it would be nice to turn that information into works? And today, I already have a lot of information/knowledge/value/you name it references, but I still don't know when to consume and process them.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZrwfisAi3cBNwohxY7776AGtb4BhjgvdyuqgVVUTyoEN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYRJNt9Hxccnbm6UfwMTEtXb75qBAL5CPdrwBHpxNTEEj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZrwfisAi3cBNwohxY7776AGtb4BhjgvdyuqgVVUTyoEN", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hzAsBJzifph6288TAmwSZsW94pgK8fWAz"], "tags": ["Drawing", "Illustration", "Watercolor", "Personal", "PNG"], "extra": {}}
