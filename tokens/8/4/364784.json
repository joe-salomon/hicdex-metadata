Ready for a ridiculously dumb story to that'll either make you want to keep reading this insane book or close it and never open it again? So we have a racer. Let's call him Ace. Ace was in a race. He was great. He was cocky. He was in first place, but a sudden chase with 2nd place caused an error in his computer interface. A crash with a rail and injured his face. Yelled and screamed, hands up in the air in utter disgrace. Unfair! Unfair! He proclaimed! I demand justice! I demand rerace! Now Ace, out of the race, has no medals, has no kindness, from his fans he receives no embrace. Only a broken ego and a pair of wheelbase. He leaves the course. He leaves the race, along with his tattered uniform and empty briefcase, full of space...never to return because of his failure to reflect, respect, restep, retrace. In limerick and rhyme, a lesson this time. We learn the simple art of losing with grace. (end scene) There you kids...a lesson on how not to be a jerk. Did I lose you yet? No? Still here? Awesome...let's proceed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWCwu82QawscWy3eF3w5tjTRwkDPCazGYz43oGXhF1wxA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeSWHQpn5nRhPNDDy9Zq5P2zs2c4Ysg7gAhrD6Pae85hQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWCwu82QawscWy3eF3w5tjTRwkDPCazGYz43oGXhF1wxA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
