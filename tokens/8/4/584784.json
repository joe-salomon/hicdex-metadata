The pixels are recombined in a different resolution with the same area. Half of it is inverted, then reconverted to 256 x 256. This procedure can be repeated up to 8 times.\n\nOut of those straightforward steps and strict rules, highly complex and completely distinct patterns emerge.\n\n256x256x256x256 is a generative series created by Leston (@matheusleston)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXLsEHM4cpnsp3RHTtVW39TCBW8pspwR95bMSFMto8Qkk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSNjfQ4ohEwNKFyuHhRAyQnLmJEk8KNXUN89JnrbpEZQ8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXLsEHM4cpnsp3RHTtVW39TCBW8pspwR95bMSFMto8Qkk", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eZv3NVo44c2LJ78pKUKabFUZABemX3QMN"], "tags": ["loop", "generative", "pixelart", "code", "math", "max/msp", "procedural"], "extra": {}}
