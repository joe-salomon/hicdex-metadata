But this one-of-a-kind eagle is now in a bad position as its population is classified as critically endangered.\n\nIn Philippine folklore, Eagle attributes to a greedy man.  In the olden days, Bathala created a man named Bugso. Everything on earth which Bugso coveted was given to him by Bathala. But Bugso was a creature who found no contentment in life. He wanted wings because he wanted to establish dominion over the heavens.\n \nIt reminds us, our greediness will give us bad luck. \n\nSources: https://www.zenrooms.com/blog/post/endangered-species-in-the-philippines/\nhttps://www.wattpad.com/780049624-alamat-ng-agila-published-by-lampara-books-alamat\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYEdkxF9USi5vTo4AK9oChqehmdJp72WAHK8nELKhseWF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP7LBBkkv4gpTTZSm5pSUccusGd2WbMTg4hYG8XLwRgsY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYEdkxF9USi5vTo4AK9oChqehmdJp72WAHK8nELKhseWF", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZzWbwteKmwRiwE3YNMa2JufN4q1wEUUdh"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "psychedelicart", "astral", "folklore", "animalart"], "extra": {}}
