Each Poster-comic presents a different and auto conclusive story, although at the same time these stories cross their paths and are connected to each other.\n\nHandmade drawing, digital color.\n2500x3547 pixels", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaqkSSSz79QpvzaAHw8W6YSD4Gwn6zBLA1A6t4vdJyPnW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVHoobSAsM6XSLK5YEAB3hk89LEjYFotSuYmHCQEgR5hh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaqkSSSz79QpvzaAHw8W6YSD4Gwn6zBLA1A6t4vdJyPnW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cicJW6zjuqNTRjKMumwiPySsnhvyxAby3"], "tags": ["silenceofnobodies", "postercomics", "estudiokodixe", "comics", "story", "metaphysics", "jpg"], "extra": {}}
