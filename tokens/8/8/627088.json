When the knot is untied, then the ego and the mind rush into the heart. They both sink into the heart center, which is the true self, and you become liberated. So look at yourself honestly. Study your thoughts. It is your thoughts that bring you problems and troubles. You believed that thoughts are necessary, that you must have thoughts, otherwise you will not be able to exist, you will not be able to function. Quite the opposite: when your thoughts are surpassed and transformed, then pure awareness, absolute reality takes over.\nQuote by Bhagavan Maharshi\n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2020, 70x50 cm, spray paint on canvas, 7931x11185 pix.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVXEaVidWsykKuTBhQQKgF8kSdL9KtTtLXnA6Zh2odFtW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWZufyRc5r49TzwZJhCrUX9WaS7dRU3UNcniDQKXp2dAX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVXEaVidWsykKuTBhQQKgF8kSdL9KtTtLXnA6Zh2odFtW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["spray", "painting", "original", "colorful", "canvas", "fluorescent", "denysenko_art"], "extra": {}}
