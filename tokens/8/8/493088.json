The technology that surrounds us in the world and with which we interact on a daily basis, evolves at a much faster rate than our own.\n\nHow will we manage to keep up with the technological evolution? How will our psyche keep up with the demands of the constant bombardment of information from the device that sits in the palm of our hand? \n\nHow will our younger generations survive without emotional scars of trying to \"fit in\" with the latest trends or artificial looks thrown at them daily on social media?\n\nThe Evolution of the Mind is about the slow, almost painstakingly slow, evolution of our psychology and our daily struggle with our own ego.\n\nDigital Collage by @dehiscenceart 2021\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmatxJNtV7nUc1gD4JWwJx3j83wnLk5NmAuG9rtzsrgNts", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPueGbttY6SMJUaQtJb3Maud9avC5tzmjHZwaiGAERkuB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmatxJNtV7nUc1gD4JWwJx3j83wnLk5NmAuG9rtzsrgNts", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Ng4YqzSHvUEDox53H948MrsdWFvJMsKFo"], "tags": ["collage", "digitalcollage", "dehiscence", "artwithamessage", "scifiart", "emotions", "biology", "anatomy", "psychology", "evolution"], "extra": {}}
