The pandemic, the extreme necropolitic government here in Brazil and the super dry weather causing water rationing have been so draining, not only people but the city, the trees, the sky has been clearly sick.\nIn the past few weeks a lot of people have been fully vacinated here, covid is starting to decrease; spring is bringing rain again, and the perspective of living in a more healthy government has been more real. These days when it was raining I stopped for a moment and started observing the water falling, and after it stopped, a profoundly beautiful feeling of life was pairing in the air, I swear even the sidewalks were emanating a feeling of life. Everything is still completely wrong here in Brazil, we are still living in a government of death, but feeling hope after two years of constant horror has been unspeakably meaningfull.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYuc1zQZaXbscQw1V6PUqMZn41iK6jQNyVATb6AkdRjuY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYuc1zQZaXbscQw1V6PUqMZn41iK6jQNyVATb6AkdRjuY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYuc1zQZaXbscQw1V6PUqMZn41iK6jQNyVATb6AkdRjuY", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2W855ubdYy4LYPMeSnaGURMjSxcXbF3e2z"], "tags": ["gif", "dither", "rain", "hope"], "extra": {}}
