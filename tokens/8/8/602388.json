My old owners (fee5ways) had decided it was time to let me go even though he had tried before without success. He simply put me out on the side of the house ready for the week's trash pickup. Which meant two days and two nights in the cold and rain. Call it luck, two teenaged children spotted me on my first day out. They gathered me up and drove us home. \n\nAt the time of my rescue nobody was aware that my owners, both new and old, have been friends for years and years. Can you imagine the look on Fee5ways face when he saw me in Soapbox's house? Fee5ways was amused that he couldn't remove me from his life completely. I believe he was relieved that I found a good home. \n\nMy new owners love me, they love me so much, they have immortalized me on the blockchain. \nMy new trajectory: digitally infinite.\n\nTRUTH\n\nv1 and v2 were shot almost simultaneously from two slightly different angles\n\nv1 - iPhone 12\nv2 - 1+Pro", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaVh7ZikU9LbrBsET2yjMLfjbhvA6z1JkcFz4uJcuDixa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaVh7ZikU9LbrBsET2yjMLfjbhvA6z1JkcFz4uJcuDixa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaVh7ZikU9LbrBsET2yjMLfjbhvA6z1JkcFz4uJcuDixa", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["KT1Pa9RKifwvL4UpvV7hf2CCdzznLpB7wWK6"], "tags": ["lights", "camera", "action", "art", "photography"], "extra": {}}
