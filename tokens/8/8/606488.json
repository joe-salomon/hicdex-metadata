It is the card that tell you to be an idiot and do it, to purchase your dreams and reach your goals, even when you have nothing and are walking on a tightrope.\nTo become the magician and start manifesting your reality, you have to first accept the role as a fool. Accept that the better way to know everything is to first know nothing. Let every being be your teacher, work and cocreate the person you are on this journey, at this lifetime. It may seem like, but the fool is not alone. None of us.\nPut on a show, the Universe is watching you.\n\nsize: [2480\u00d73508]\n\nLast painting of 2021\n\nBackground: Pillars of Creation, the birth of a star, with RGB shift, photo by Hubble.\n[M16\u2014Eagle Nebula Pillars at 4.1.1995]\n\nIt has been an amazing year, thank you!\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRAC2DVPW5dqr8S6547MhB2tb1qEsKDR6GTSRmYf4RAEs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPysUjjjPZ9jvKaXqxjDYQbn7ui9dVzxPQLQ1BUxSpCcT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRAC2DVPW5dqr8S6547MhB2tb1qEsKDR6GTSRmYf4RAEs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QJSNDRTqpwP8NUBBjijSReAbo1qr5Kc6r"], "tags": ["cosmic", "tarot", "witch", "space", "fool", "jester", "tarotdeck", "painting"], "extra": {}}
