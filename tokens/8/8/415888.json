{"__version": 1, "token_id": 415888, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Hasanlu Lovers - Love is Timeless", "description": "In 800 B.C., a young couple living in Hasanlu Teppe in Iran was slaughtered by invading tribes. Their skeletal remains were found buried together. What has once been assumed to be the female, is grasping the man's head for a final kiss.  By now, some researcher say that the kissing person was actually male as well. Is it possible that these lovers were killed because of their orientation? \n\nWhat must have transpired nearly 3000 years ago seems to be both heart-wrenching and beautiful. Regardless of why they died, their love for each other echoes into the present. \n\nWhen the couple was excavated in the early 1970s, a photograph was taken. My work is a visual continuum of the story over the ages.\n\n\"Hasanlu lovers\" are a testament of true love - even in death . I wanted to tell this couple's story and hold them high as a symbol for timeless love. The color filters and paint type schemes invoke known time periods that occurred after the couple's departure from this world. Their love and embrace is just as important and beautiful today as it was in 800 B.C.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRVSocLu1d5W3qL1J8Tnt5ayhG6QUocpnTpU9rinywWmY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPZQiid1bgDrTh8xTBhuw2prURnYC6L8gPtqApBTrztHY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRVSocLu1d5W3qL1J8Tnt5ayhG6QUocpnTpU9rinywWmY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2L3U87GbQvBACiFqW9PLXSwf5UvzDBvrhG"], "tags": ["love", "skeletons", "ancient", "hasanlu", "lovers", ""], "extra": {}}
