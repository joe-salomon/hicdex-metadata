It is registered as: URcloud#14.90. It was moving in the direction SSE with the speed of about 20km/h. It was love at first sight. Owning a cloud is a poetic investment. Sharing the cloud a gesture of social commitment.  \n\nClimate forecasts assume that there will be no more clouds in about 150 years. The cumulus cloud will be one of the first cloud types to be extinct. \n\nDiscovery details\nID: URcloud#14.90\nLocation: 52\u00b0N 13\u00b0E (Berlin)\nDirection: SSO\nSpeed: 20km/h\nCloudicity: 5u\nEnergy: 5000 kj\nTemperature: 8\u00b0\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNTVm8VrtJiQgQE7ikatHVEGYpm3jRp5nmmY3Ewn1abMb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQmR52NiPVYco1me6FQaigHgzjHer15tYCZYZY16u1bq6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmT7PqZ5FFd6ACshF9YmRcY54dYdLi4f8HZLtrBjFZb8Xu", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNTVm8VrtJiQgQE7ikatHVEGYpm3jRp5nmmY3Ewn1abMb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RoSufwpFcSSJB4JFSohvBnQbNWzBkqM9q"], "tags": ["cloud", "cloudsurfing", "couchsurfing"], "extra": {}}
