For each region, the mean value of the colors in that region is calculated and replaced by a unit of concentric circles.\n\nIn each unit the color of the outer circle coincides with the mean color calculated for the corresponding region. The color of each successive inner circle is calculated by randomly modifying the RGB components up to a maximum of 5 out of 256 with respect to the immediately outer circle. In this way a certain chromatic aberration is achieved.\n\nThe circles are placed on the image in random order to create an arbitrary overlap.\n\nThe perception of the image is different when zooming in on it.\n\nSize: 3486 x 5112 px.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZU8G7D9HhQAJPYb6x6jfsVrvxD226CR5XpqoByhX5nkD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbpTJdGNri8KxMfMAYdmcP4mhQNw6p3ZJKcA9FtZbGroh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZU8G7D9HhQAJPYb6x6jfsVrvxD226CR5XpqoByhX5nkD", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gMYXjqi7sxsdu9PGYgicrWZvz41mpvsCF"], "tags": ["genart", "generative", "generativeart", "python", "pillow", "creativecode", "creativecoding", "abstract", "cleannft", "colorful", "codeart", "creativecoding", "monalisa", "lamonalisa", "gioconda", "leonardo", "davinci"], "extra": {}}
