Many of these images are smaller fragments of larger pieces and have been framed in a particular way. The framing of something, whether it be visual or mental is a strong concept that occupies a lot of my thinking on the subject of memory. These artworks have been crafted with thoughtful insight and tender loving care. On a technical level, they mix home-brewed generative systems with hand-drawn images using Processing and GANs. \n\nSpecial Edition for my top ten collectors.\nSize : 2444X 2444 PNG [bitmap image]\n2021 | Mark Webster @motiondesign_01", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbuCvdUYQHtwyerDF7TNVDYFdgW84fuTt7jrVpmeeRARf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeWq4t3s2oYZEmVP7bp49jbwz1DBj5DEhadCXHjap4paa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmeL2yCqH7ccDaJ78gVb4viY8wpsAqUm8eF3GEvTWamuea", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbuCvdUYQHtwyerDF7TNVDYFdgW84fuTt7jrVpmeeRARf", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iZbRAAsj6GfhPqiX3yCoW8F1cw7oXrxG1"], "tags": ["GANs", "neuralnet", "generative", "drawing", "Processing", "markwebster", "memory", "modular"], "extra": {}}
