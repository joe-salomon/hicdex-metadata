The result is used to paint a color for this exact pixel. \n\nThe result is a huge collection of pseudo-fractal images which evoke impossible landscapes, crowded cities, glitchy psychedelic with vivid colors or just beautiful patterns. All of them are deterministic given its initial parameters.\n\nPlease feel free to play and enjoy.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme6y8yLCvEs4TfJeH7nL88uUyFXdqQZ6jCZahzFey4TDX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTb744TNi2fyw59wt9BgM8NeyAingcwk8ik6fBt1bc9m3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme6y8yLCvEs4TfJeH7nL88uUyFXdqQZ6jCZahzFey4TDX", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SpToaU7V2HkUJ3KjJmRFx9k2XFAJH5Sc6"], "tags": ["fractal", "codeart", "math", "js", "genart", "abstract", "art", "algorithmic", "script", "generative", "colorful", "glitch", "creativecode", "unique"], "extra": {}}
