{"__version": 1, "token_id": 585488, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LAVA", "description": "On LAVA, I wanted to make something that looked like it had high viscosity using only one word. The word LAVA lends itself perfectly for this purpose. The angles on the letters \"A\" and \"V\" create the sense of movement in-between the letters in an almost free-flowing capacity. On top of all that, we add gradient colors between orange and purple. What we are left with is a feeling of slowed movement. The words look and feel hot to touch and yet are completely harmless. By shifting the gradients back and forth on the artwork, we amplify the heat, the molasses like movement, and somewhat rock like structures that are left behind from the formation. Fun mental exercise time: What word can you thinking of that can do this? Try it out, get some paper and a pencil/pen and see what you come up with. You might just surprise yourself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPSyN2RmmcvmMkSPmA87Z18jWMDpGaNzyNBP6tBgwb2fW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcWd75LdjdB9WJhnqbn5B6C8jwwEgs4U8wGkV1zAgv4Ce", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPSyN2RmmcvmMkSPmA87Z18jWMDpGaNzyNBP6tBgwb2fW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
