Click once and it will tell Safari that you're interested in seeing things as they were meant to be and it will speed up.\n\nOn Desktop:\n\n- Click once to add additional streamers to the current composition\n- Double-click to start a new random composition.\n- Press the space bar to export the current frame as a png image. You might need to be in full screen mode.\n- Share your stuff on Twitter and tag me @clayheaton because I love seeing it. :)\n\nOn Mobile:\n\n- Tap once with a single appendage to add additional streamers\n- Tap once with two appendages simultaneously and the piece might reset to start a new random composition. If it doesn't, try again a few times. If that fails, refresh the page. I promise that I tried to make this work properly.\n\n\n\n\n** Guarantee not guaranteed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcXbKa6pThQrpSu5CAtRgrk5z9fFge28MKSSneAH3EUDU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVnSaYsVw8jvJHRQuwxNjX8oWtaR6XbgKmCfBgyRLrJ5E", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcXbKa6pThQrpSu5CAtRgrk5z9fFge28MKSSneAH3EUDU", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1LH1yn4tKVmNNeSzwoRT6zZ375K9yi1NoR"], "tags": ["clayheaton", "p5.js", "color", "colorful", "happy", "animated", "generative"], "extra": {}}
