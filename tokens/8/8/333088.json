I had saved this concept by Robin Lhebrard for a while and have been wanting to make more of a \"city\" environment so I thought it was the perfect time to give it a go. Somewhere along the way I migrated everything to UE5 because I wanted to check out lumen and see what else is new. I had a blast creating this and I might even if I find the time create a night version as well.\nHope you like it!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTxjPWaHUC61SiTWERNnGukqRyh9PDqMem5ayGZpkS5n1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTwjosqiDVpkFm4Wu6bh8C2iVfSc9zCFwtyQKQo6xXXQb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTxjPWaHUC61SiTWERNnGukqRyh9PDqMem5ayGZpkS5n1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1e4kxCf7UXR1UvKib4zPESfsdfPShwgNir"], "tags": ["ParisStreet-UE5"], "extra": {}}
