The artist uses Processing to create his digital paintings.\n\nDimensions: 3200 x 3200", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNNHUrw5xtidJLwP2kAvJac2mAhAaMig9FidCpBWNTeaR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTDP7FpBk77uokwUCfbDxRVAzzoJXPvkNgTCZ96EZnTD5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNNHUrw5xtidJLwP2kAvJac2mAhAaMig9FidCpBWNTeaR", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fPY1cnN1YGSWDxxiMbJ4BcUYFwK13wheA"], "tags": ["generativeart", "genart", "geometric", "exposure"], "extra": {}}
