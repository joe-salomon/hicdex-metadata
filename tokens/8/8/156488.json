Even though there is seemingly 1 item being sold in that specific `swap_id`. The price should be of that `swap_id` multiplied by `objkt_amount`. And the rest of tokens is taken from the contract, robbing currently opened secondary market positions. That is the heart of the exploit and it could simply be done by Temple Wallet without ever leaving your browser.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbdjGbBaJYyyjgP3j3e7dW1bgSn4DtCHPW3J4hfGp5oHM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdjGbBaJYyyjgP3j3e7dW1bgSn4DtCHPW3J4hfGp5oHM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbdjGbBaJYyyjgP3j3e7dW1bgSn4DtCHPW3J4hfGp5oHM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Ndt2zz9eYm5tVNKy3NLDpQeQTHAJYe8Mt"], "tags": ["CODE", "HACK", "EXPLOIT"], "extra": {}}
