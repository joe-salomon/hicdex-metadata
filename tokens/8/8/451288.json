{"__version": 1, "token_id": 451288, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "21-10-19 (unconstructed)", "description": "3D object\n\nThis collage finished on 19 October 2021, around 00.15 in the morning. Since 2018 I\u00a0make\u00a0collages regularly\u00a0as an escape from my daily routine. I try to experience many techniques and materials I can find around me. From 2018 I already made around 700 analog collages, and some digital too.\n\nFrom around 2020 I started\u00a0to use a cutting\u00a0technique that allow me to avoid overlapping paper on my collage. Yes, it makes the cutting process more complicated and takes a longer time, but then it makes me realize that I love the cutting process (and hate gluing part!).\n\nFor\u00a0this collage, I mint two versions, one that was already finished, and one that is still unglued after the cutting process. The latter I made as a 3D object because I want\u00a0to show how my collage looks before they're glued.\n\nThe\u00a0number on the title is from the date I made this collage (yy-mm-dd), and\u00a0the letters show the order of the collages I made that day. I rarely have definite titles for my collages, until they will be displayed at exhibitions, so these dates\u00a0are the true identity of my collages.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcywq47BbQ9eo5EB992TLFqsudAwTcncDTMQiznS5GD1h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdEirNnLgjZou3NEhbbMK3VJCuuD7WiN9mUMX3i1varRs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcywq47BbQ9eo5EB992TLFqsudAwTcncDTMQiznS5GD1h", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1av3PU2PNW6WxHVZuVSAwjbySs7McRLEFB"], "tags": ["comic", "cartoon", "collage", "jurnalkolasefrnss", "analogcollage", "aliceinwoderland", "pokemon", "ashketchum", "aladdin", "3d"], "extra": {}}
