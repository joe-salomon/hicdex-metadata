He is supportive and loves his servants protecting them from evil. Allah wants victory for us and will guide mankind towards the path of righteousness.\n\nAnd Allah is most knowing of your enemies; and sufficient is Allah as an ally, and sufficient is Allah as a helper. (Quran 4:45)\n\nIndeed, my protector is Allah, who has sent down the Book; and He is an ally to the righteous. (Quran 7:196)\n\nAnd it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy. (Quran 42:28)\n\nIndeed, they will never avail you against Allah at all. And indeed, the wrongdoers are allies of one another; but Allah is the protector of the righteous.
