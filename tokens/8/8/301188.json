I used an obscure password to ensure I don\u2019t remember it. I will permanently forget/destroy these three items so nobody, including myself, has further access to this wallet other than to \u201ctag\u201d it with your art via airdrop. Video documentation of the burn will be minted via external wallet (because I will have burned the pw, obviously) and sent to this wallet. I leave the rest up to chaos. -BA", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigun57brxu72s6sr4vbbewnmjmansqydww3p4xmrll3gyvpw7ccuy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreig6doyqyv3goyddh7tsy3rcetihc7u66upj6gtpfcfcobsk6nxc6y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://bafybeigun57brxu72s6sr4vbbewnmjmansqydww3p4xmrll3gyvpw7ccuy"}], "creators": ["tz1LK2BFwG3daMKZGR321owX4iAJYLxX88T9"], "tags": ["decentralization"], "extra": {}}
