Events transpiring in one space inform the other, and vice versa. \n\nDunya is part of an ongoing mystic investigation into meaning-production. The project considers how mythology, narrative and play are employed to understand a system whose workings we cannot immediately grasp.\n\nDunya is also a generative work of fantasy, a would-be epic poem of love, hate, death, mournful angels, ghosts adrift, and changing under the cycles of the moon.\"\nhttp://hsoderstrom.international/dunya.html", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdSJQ2y8homL4KFpw9QTuEdZGkUHaEkSVG95qFYJW8D2c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSBHh5trzux6TAr6UssQx5bKmsSh5MJFpAcEHKZ5r3BZi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdSJQ2y8homL4KFpw9QTuEdZGkUHaEkSVG95qFYJW8D2c", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eWnr23nMBMvSa1iPkyi2pnsZmE6zhUKtR"], "tags": ["hsoderstrom", "henriksoederstroem", "ghost", "angel", "demon", "dunya", "virtualworld", "spiritplane", "godflesh", "unity", "unity3d"], "extra": {}}
