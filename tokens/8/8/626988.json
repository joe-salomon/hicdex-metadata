The sounds of the drums could be heard for miles.\nThey wanted you to know they were coming.\nThey wanted your hair to stand on end and for you to be afraid.\nThe amber lights of the flickering heat reflected in a thousand eyes. \nYelping and whistling they communicated in a language of war alone.\nThe torches provided warmth on their naked bodies and the thoughts of retribution burned wildly in their core.\nPray the other side to be ready.\nPray for them that this battle be swift and their burials short.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfUHcfYfh3joS8PNjLRSrjEfLS8e14txyJqdmp3rL9nMj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXXn7vWUCvxQ58TsgCdfXeJXSQXWUpnRrPxx18GrxCXzJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfUHcfYfh3joS8PNjLRSrjEfLS8e14txyJqdmp3rL9nMj", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UXPeDzfhtXfSFT796Zby3VKWfmTC5pavU"], "tags": ["AI", "story", "words", "art", "prose"], "extra": {}}
