This connection can only be two soul mates. They are two souls that complement each other like no one else in the world can complement each other, a more than perfect connection, it's as if they've known each other for a long time. These are feelings that echo from somewhere in the past, even if you haven't met the person yet. This soul connection is not just a loving relationship, between a couple, whether heterosexual or homosexual, but also a friendship relationship between two people.\"\n\n@napstudio.br\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigm4qonlbjy2h6gncw5v53y26ujsw5scd4xgu5gwhncnznmwq6e4q", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigm4qonlbjy2h6gncw5v53y26ujsw5scd4xgu5gwhncnznmwq6e4q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigm4qonlbjy2h6gncw5v53y26ujsw5scd4xgu5gwhncnznmwq6e4q", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz29u6B1R4TnLH8cpqiAsa7U3WJiBH6C59eg"], "tags": ["#love", "#soul", "#painting", "#colored"], "extra": {}}
