He was finally beheaded by Colonel Vel\u00e1zquez, and his murderer became his first devotee.\n\nI chose to represent it with the Japanese print aesthetic (Ukiyo e), because I admire the way this culture preserves its popular beliefs.\n\n\ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a (@\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbqmiPgkd5dLNyKwqbjswg59YfEcjjeiRTq6HjC8f3fP4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZnA8yThBAe87owCKmYg85yp3qN1KW1JDNGhFnys65UFU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbqmiPgkd5dLNyKwqbjswg59YfEcjjeiRTq6HjC8f3fP4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
