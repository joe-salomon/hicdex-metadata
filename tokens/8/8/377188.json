Transfer it to the pan where it will find its sauce and you will be happy.\n\n5) And finally, feel every bite as a gift from Paradise, as an eternal offering from immemorial grandmothers so that we will always have a good plate of pasta on our table.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYWfMcpUu28xpz3Y27HxuCJwER2KfFHQZMgPQQMyLC6RS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfFr8vPwWu52Zeo5LZHFYF1kcit7XG2hi5fABvfqmkbGZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYWfMcpUu28xpz3Y27HxuCJwER2KfFHQZMgPQQMyLC6RS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VALLpJZQ6T45yTAEMwriGK9wB7EMrE5yP"], "tags": ["pasta", "photography", "photo", "tapes", "music", ""], "extra": {}}
