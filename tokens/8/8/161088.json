{"__version": 1, "token_id": 161088, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Convergence", "description": "What if we are an eventual occurrence in a parallel reality? How would we know? I tried to depict this scenario through this drone shot. I like to think that the mass of nothingness in the center of this shot is 'The White Hole.' It is a hypothetical region of spacetime which is the reciprocal of a Black Hole. White hole has the power to 'genesis' while the black hole is the source of darkness. The White Hole produces different eventualities which roam around the known space. Life goes own in these parallel eventualities, until it reaches a 'CONVERGENCE'. As you can see from this video, we are headed towards convergence (white car moving towards the end of the roads which would eventually meet at the end). What will happen then? Union? Ultimate Singularity? Who are the divergents who move against the space time continuum? I wish to know more. ...... Work by Ashik J Cheeran. Shot in DJI.
