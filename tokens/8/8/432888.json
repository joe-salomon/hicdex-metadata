Rotting from the inside out, these aquatic demons propel themselves forward at high speeds with their muscular tail and eviscerate their prey with their jagged claws. If the prey is large, Gutrippers will spear it with their ventral, barbed appendages to attach itself, all while it hacks at its prey until nothing but bloody gore is left. The Gutripper Shrimp then uses its rotting face to slurp up the mess. \n\nGutrippers are also known to bounce about on land with their tails, and they are known to surprise their prey by launching themselves out of bodies of water (including toilets when in their juvenile stage). While strong, deadly, and fast, they can be easily dispatched with standard terrestrial weaponry, landing them with a Creeper designation.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmReKetghJfiFezApNXWNzuRowEJAtqGThLrmAW26Umh3c", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSyDR1SWinntuLqJr4pasdG41z4CGpA9kTgcHstrRdnfQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmReKetghJfiFezApNXWNzuRowEJAtqGThLrmAW26Umh3c", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["shrimp", "demon", "darkart", "darkwheelnft", "darkwheel", "evil", "horror", "horrorart", "monster", "illustration"], "extra": {}}
