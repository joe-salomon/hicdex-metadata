Now the funkykoala standing outside with the falling snow waiting for someone to accompany him celebrate the christmas eve. Will you accompany him?\n\nMake this CHRISTMAS GIF as a CHRISTMAS GIFT\n\nIt's a little bit tricky to make this art, especially because of my wooden PC lol and my skill that not too pro. Day to day i'm usually write a program as a software engineer but in the other side i love to making art and i love Crypto and NFT. So forgive my skill of making art is absolutely so-so hehe. Merry Christmas Everyone, Love Y'all!\n\nTotal Frame : 150", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY15mCFSE76VvynsZS5HCaeAg8eMx7HAvCRP35JFVaurM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY15mCFSE76VvynsZS5HCaeAg8eMx7HAvCRP35JFVaurM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY15mCFSE76VvynsZS5HCaeAg8eMx7HAvCRP35JFVaurM", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1PiTp8kkCBF1E8sY3zhpuafpmeMn75mKJi"], "tags": ["funkykoala", "funky", "koala", "christmas", "merrychristmas", "santa", "santaclaus", "christmaseve", "winter", "snow"], "extra": {}}
