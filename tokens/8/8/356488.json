Please Stand By, You\u2019ll Be Departed Shortly. President Biden\u2019s immigration policies came into the spotlight this week as Texas border patrol was video taped and photographed riding horses and corralling Haitian immigrants, attempting to enter America through the crossing of the Rio Grande, like animals in a pen. Haiti has seen its country deteriorate since the earthquake that devastated them in 2010. Since then, they\u2019ve gone through flash floods, a pandemic, the assassination of their prime minister, international intervention in their politics, and another earthquake, much within the last 2 months. And while President Biden recently remarked on the photos of border patrol as \u201chorrible,\u201d and that \u201cthose people (responsible) will pay,\u201d it\u2019s time for him to take action and reform the terrible immigration policies of the previous administration. Because right now a Biden presidency doesn\u2019t look much different than a Trump presidency when it comes to immigration.
