THE LIFTER reaches down and pulls up THE FILTER and in doing so reverses the letters \"L\" and \"F\" to create and X like structure, which functions like an inductive/deductive hourglass filter. The structures we find in words sometimes define themselves in a meta-type way that boggles the mind. Is this coincidence or something based on algorithmic principles of letter usage frequency?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQZcRexwH1b1WNMmFTNMunrsBgWZS6yXwGWJpuzSreRH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbDRcjM2iQ4zbUmZzpccWazwQwVbGLaGSRyiH6W4G91BR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQZcRexwH1b1WNMmFTNMunrsBgWZS6yXwGWJpuzSreRH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
