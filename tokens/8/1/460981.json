Eleven-year-old Christian Shaw, daughter of the Laird of Bargarran, complained of being tormented by some local witches; they included one of her family's servants, Catherine Campbell, whom she had reported to her mother for stealing a pint of milk\n\nSeven people \u2013 Catherine Campbell(pictured), Margaret Lang, Margaret Fulton, and Agnes Naismith along with John Lyndsay (11), his brother James Lyndsay (14), and James Reid \u2013 were found guilty of having bewitched Shaw and were condemned to death \n\nJames Reid subsequently committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell, the others were hanged and then burned on the Gallow Green in Paisley on 10 June 1697, the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe\n\nLocal Minister of Killallan James Hutchison delivered a damning sermon which sealed the accused\u2019s fates\n\nHutchison placed great store on the presence of witches marks on the bodies of the accused, and cast doubt on the natural explanations of those marks offered by some physicians: \"And however doctors may say such and such things of it [a witches' mark], we know not upon what ground. It may be that they have been budded and bribed to say such things\"\n\nHutchison told the jury: \u201cYou would be accessory to all the blasphemies, apostasies, murders, torture, and seductions whereof these enemies of heaven and earth shall [carry out]\u201d if they did not find the accused guilty\n\nAnd so the accused were found guilty of the crimes of witchcraft, sorcery, necromancy and charming - all valid crimes to prosecute under in 17th century Scotland\n\nDuring their public hanging, it is said that Agnes laid a dying woman\u2019s curse on the town; and for years after their execution, every tragedy which took place in Paisley was blamed on the witch's curse\n\nIn May 2008 a memorial was laid at the site of their burial which consists of a horseshoe and the words \"Pain-Inflicted-Suffering-Endured-Injustice-Done\" to pay tribute to the torturous death these people went through as a result of a misplaced law\n\n\nOne of a series working with AI to give face to women executed as witches; these form part of a broader collection of Horror Portraits at www.horrorportraits.xyz\n\n#WitchingHourOnHEN \n\nCan be used as #PFP and #wallpaper\n\nPNG 4800 x 4800", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVRYaiZo4EWwPSQ7G9FSSoG5HdLGcMgabMkVUEkAHBikR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX2JdScE12AKghQr8oMw6E35wvqxqcY973f9cqB8TXk4o", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVRYaiZo4EWwPSQ7G9FSSoG5HdLGcMgabMkVUEkAHBikR", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NWtHHck4dxpwCSGVrboat83R9STyLfmfA"], "tags": ["portraits", "gan", "horror", "goth", "darkart", "pfps", "witch", "death", "gothic", "stevemunro", "witchinghouronhen", "murder", "generativeart", "horrorportraits", "CatherineCampbell", "pfp", "witches", "darkartstudio", "torture", "witchtrials", ""], "extra": {}}
