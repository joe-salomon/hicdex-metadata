I've changed her little monster character that cosplay to Tani (A Thai traditional ghost which appears as a young woman that haunts wild banana trees known generically as lady of the wood.) to an abstract art. The concept is talking about the little monster that want to explore the world. So I design the green to be mainly part of the painting like the cover of banana and added soft yellow color to be the banana. You will see that some part of the yellow is going out from the green cover. It means like a little monster who want to go out of the box and explore the new world. Also I added more pink and busy line to give a little fun and naughty feeling of it. Hope you enjoy her journey.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeieq7pls5psbbfj5fkoaukvyopwhasambe7e6wq5p7ydsojc3tjwra", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreic2msl5d2t343lu77npf7rmniv6sa7vlzbxvevbog7tkfvlicosya", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeieq7pls5psbbfj5fkoaukvyopwhasambe7e6wq5p7ydsojc3tjwra", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UyQS8mdJ8abNodDjV7bH7kDHJgKJvi5AS"], "tags": ["abstract", "abstractart", "colorful", "littlemonster", "ThaiGhost"], "extra": {}}
