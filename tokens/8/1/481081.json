The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: My name is Terry and I am a patient at the VA clinic in the town I lived in from 2001 to \n2012. I go there for health checks. Today, I get up and paint my nails. Then, alone in the exam room, I speak with the female doctor, who is barefoot and tattooed. She tells me about a brain aneurysm she suffered years ago. She has two choices: have surgery to remove it, or live with the permanent damage. I think this is very close to my own situation. I worry that she won\u2019t make the right decision.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 88 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc3m3c5uETiBeCL6eaUDmDtnWJuMHjU9WWVkeMRqNSdc6", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmecnbi5G1N8cfAZDCqcXTDUd6uixgcAQxrquDRm7Tt7cs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc3m3c5uETiBeCL6eaUDmDtnWJuMHjU9WWVkeMRqNSdc6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
