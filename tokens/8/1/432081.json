LET IT BE, is a mantra journey into acceptance of who you are and who everyone else is at the same time. We're all alive and going through whatever \"life\" is giving us at any particular moment. Whatever emotion you're feeling is ok; feel it. When you feel, the universe feels. You are the universe experiencing itself. Never let anyone steal your power. We all have the same capacity for emotions (for the most part), but it's how you respond to situations that changes the perspective. LET IT BE is a freeing mantra that gives you power to accept yourself and others. Accept the abundance of the universe; you're part of it.
