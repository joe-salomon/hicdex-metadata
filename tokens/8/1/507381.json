Its represented by color pixels that try to move always in the same directions. The pixels try to expand while there is space available, and they try to coexist with the others or get extint. Often only a color survive at the end.\nThe waves you see happen as dots die and the children get born. There is no random behaviour (just for the initial conditions) there are only very simple rules.\n\nIn this version #2 the color pixels are similar to strokes of a brush.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTjJBzXp8XY3NsHNDBbpNobhPB1NDobFhvqR1hfhsXibm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfWr4cqUgtGkcqRrT6uvn4oAKiF1Q44s2Zwbr2mzAvUXH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTjJBzXp8XY3NsHNDBbpNobhPB1NDobFhvqR1hfhsXibm", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SpToaU7V2HkUJ3KjJmRFx9k2XFAJH5Sc6"], "tags": ["fractal", "codeart", "math", "js", "genart", "abstract", "art", "algorithmic", "script", "generative", "colorful", "glitch", "creativecode", "unique", "color", "animation", "dots", "livingcolordots"], "extra": {}}
