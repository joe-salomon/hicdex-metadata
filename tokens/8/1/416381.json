My thoughts, fears, sorrows, and everything else I can't or refuse to express with words. \n\nFor the past few weeks I've been experiencing depression. 'Void Door' is my way of rendering where my mind has been: trapped in a void. The 'Door' can be seen as an entry, exit, or blockage. \n\nIt's hard for me to remember how I \"enter\" depression episodes. When I'm in the midst of it, I feel like there's no exit and I feel trapped.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmehBWMLHewnkRA4vJJe6C6Vg9mdnD95m7uDm2G9y6d7Mw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTodEMNVBpgNgzWggS2r31nck48xT8gXSqFQyYDPFAftT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmehBWMLHewnkRA4vJJe6C6Vg9mdnD95m7uDm2G9y6d7Mw", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Rvs98yv2JJZBUkaaA4xRDWMNhj8avUzg9"], "tags": ["Void", "red", "digitalart", "art"], "extra": {}}
