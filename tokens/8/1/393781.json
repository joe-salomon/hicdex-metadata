{"__version": 1, "token_id": 393781, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "", "description": "These portraits are inspired by a dream teacher named \"Pai.\" She asked me to follow her to her photo lab. I went through a giant revolving door, and as I came in, she said she was going to give me a gift; that she wanted to teach me something. Pai took a small transparent hose and blew smoke all over my face. With her other hand, she took an ID picture with a small camera that immediately rendered an image. My portrait displayed digital artifacts instead of my face, and it felt like a true representation of myself. I woke up that day and immediately started this new series from what Pai taught me. Using smoke, analog, and digital video processing, I have been taking real-time video portraits of family and friends. Digital portraits can be masks of identity through manipulation or posing, but in this collaborative process, I feel I get to capture the essence of each of the persons in the form of shapes and colors. Every portrait is unique and cannot be reproduced again, as they are the result of real-time manipulations on the spot with the live subjects. This is a portrait of my wife Nandi.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeVSMNGu1czrRDN6JJJchHL6Rb8HYrU6tJJXhKUG1eGm2", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeVSMNGu1czrRDN6JJJchHL6Rb8HYrU6tJJXhKUG1eGm2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeVSMNGu1czrRDN6JJJchHL6Rb8HYrU6tJJXhKUG1eGm2", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1RdLkqan368BrBmQv8hNju72CVKpBF584f"], "tags": ["analogvideo", "digitalart", "dream"], "extra": {}}
