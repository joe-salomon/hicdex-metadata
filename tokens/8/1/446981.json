I don\u2019t remember everything and some details are still blurry in my memories.\n\nMiyajima is one of my favorite place in Japan. This island in front of Hiroshima is well known for its great torii in the sea. I love to walk around and take a step back to have a global vision of places I visit.\n\nWith this pastel editing, I want to give a fantasy and dreamy aspect to my photos. Everything seems surrealist, like a vaporwave scene from old 80s anime.\n\n[Fine Art print for collector]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf5KDisftUvUQcBjtEmjdzyPAekw2qZXMMU3dtM7L1Ua4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeQYiFnJ4RyW4rCa5fF5kDpA9wxyF3qejmV3kvBkbhohn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf5KDisftUvUQcBjtEmjdzyPAekw2qZXMMU3dtM7L1Ua4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QLaPAN88xQ6MBAZALWsLeukGemgdM4M7e"], "tags": ["art", "beautiful", "city", "colors", "colour", "cryptoart", "culture", "digitalart", "landscape", "photography", "surreal", "aesthetic", "japan", "pastel", "pink", "flowers", "Sakura"], "extra": {}}
