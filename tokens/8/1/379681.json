Rochester is a good 5.5 hours from the city. When I finally did get to visit it was for an open house at Pratt which was derailed by a nasty snow storm and ultimately got the open house canceled. I took that as a bad omen and never even applied. Fast forward almost 2 years, I'm attending The Portfolio Center in Atlanta, I earn an internship at Pentagram NYC and found myself there for 3 months anyway. One way or another we get where we want to go.
