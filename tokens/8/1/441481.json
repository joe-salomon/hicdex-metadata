The veil represents the separate conscious and subconscious realms, the seen and the unseen, and serves to keep casual onlookers out. Only the initiated may enter. The pomegranates on the veil are a symbol of abundance, fertility and the divine feminine, and are sacred to Persephone who ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld and was forced to return every year.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcbPQD5oSd8WrupMZwAcuiPdfgaE9JBbP3ePkCgMKHaVJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTP1M5hmHjvWjttfyUW7eNsemX7AGpRpddkGNknaKM133", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcbPQD5oSd8WrupMZwAcuiPdfgaE9JBbP3ePkCgMKHaVJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gw7LKELrjh7ufLGqza84xvB5ZebkajdkL"], "tags": ["3d", "3dtarot", "symbolism", "dark", "occult", "tarot"], "extra": {}}
