So instead i drew it as an urban watercolor. Different projects have made the billboards, from Apes, Punks, Longneck ladies by Nyla KidEight and his G'vol's , Foodmasku with his pizza on his face, KC and the Golden Poo, Sneakerheadz made it too. In the background those line pieces and Anonymous made it up there. \nJust having fun with creating.
