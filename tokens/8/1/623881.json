Gold Frame", "description": "Traumatized by bullying as a child and betrayed by his family whom he trusted, Alexander became one of the most evil and cunning individual demons on the planet. He was originally a student of Saint Monica\u2019s Religious School, his years of abuse enabled his mind to become corrupted. Seizing up the opportunity, Lucifer himself struck a deal with him to give his life purpose by turning him into a demon.\n\nThe Gallery Gehenna Project is a daily art project where there are multiple frames for each individual artwork, each with different types of rarity applied.
