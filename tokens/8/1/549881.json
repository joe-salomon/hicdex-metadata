He kept his spirits up and struggled even though his ice cream didn't sell well in the rainy season. He just kept his spirits up and was grateful that the ice cream didn't sell. He said to me, \"I know the ice cream that I sell will not sell in the rainy season, but I am still enthusiastic. At least I have tried to make money, the rest is surrender to God\". His words and enthusiasm inspired me to produce works of all kinds, even though not everyone likes my work, at least I keep trying.\n\nThis work was made using the realme C2 smartphone.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdddcQevp6Bibo19CK1U1N7psrwrPVfuitiVLPRhbvDfK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQMpKA9KzivB3h5rz42AAVUE28v2MD9W9QrniHALzTFZL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdddcQevp6Bibo19CK1U1N7psrwrPVfuitiVLPRhbvDfK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1T3MNe5PGr61WHy18QfUTRAzpmFY8BQbi6"], "tags": ["Cartoon", "artwork", "digitalart", "digitalpainting", "2D"], "extra": {}}
