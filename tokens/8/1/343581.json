If you focus on problems then you'll have a whole lot of problems. How about you figure out what's working for you already. What makes you feel good? however small, when you think about that there's a shift in your body. Think about it again and notice how you feel inside. The more you focus on something the more it comes into being. Choose where you put your attention wisely. What are the results you want for your life? Sit back and consider this question for a moment. Then write down how you want your life to be. Project yourself forward in time when your life is the way you want it. Write as if it's already happened and tell it in the past tense. Describe the delicious feelings that your life gives you, a life that fits you perfectly in every way.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is an interactive collaboration between artists Maia Mellier (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmekw5SGunGKmrw6J6cKhWPcXz5JwRs8BtqgbeFxjUhq3d", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNhj7616YnrBAMTSbJCWgK6hSKcKM2kpLJy1ixXx6t5aa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmekw5SGunGKmrw6J6cKhWPcXz5JwRs8BtqgbeFxjUhq3d", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectible", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
