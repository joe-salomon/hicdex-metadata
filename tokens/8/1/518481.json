As David Hockney says, the camera lies. In a sense this painting of Deal Pier takes in lots of moments that particular morning and leaves out others. The sea was silvery, the Pier Kitchen was dark and the pebbles were glowing their warm colours. The sun was still low in the early morning light shimmering on the surface.
