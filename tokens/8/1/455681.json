BLGs are so much fun to discover and bring to the light of day; like using that one \"Lemon Zest\" or \"Poppy Red\" color you haven't use on your palette for awhile. In this work, when we make use the words HELLO & RANGE, we can share the \"O\" between the two and transition between HELLO RANGE to HELL ORANGE. One of the benefits of have a sequential background in gradient form is that I start to play off the background color and think about what would integrate best with it at that particular moment. I helps keep the mind fresh and the creativity at peak performance. I hate looking at a blank white page.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ1W2jr1FJzGS3iJ1mdW1WBfcpm9nphRsSgAbKFYydCAu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmciMpynk4vC7AYDo7FdB6ftYdoo3stzeqkDeQ77S2rv1S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ1W2jr1FJzGS3iJ1mdW1WBfcpm9nphRsSgAbKFYydCAu", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
