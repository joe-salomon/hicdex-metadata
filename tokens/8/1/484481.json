The subject is holding in its right hand a human skull, echoing the scene in Shakespeare's Hamlet where the Prince of Denmark mourns Yorick (\"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him\u2026\"). The chimpanzee cradles its chin with a hand in a contemplative posture. Sitting with its left leg supporting the right, the right leg holds the calipers in its foot. A spine of one of the closed books reads \"Darwin\".", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWJXLnUgCYfKPeCswxp3Fs1xdTPBhv3brDEyhTmGcoAj4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmawZH5omDJnoiEe3R2mYiacK7Tg3Yy1ej47uzg8Yg6YLy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWJXLnUgCYfKPeCswxp3Fs1xdTPBhv3brDEyhTmGcoAj4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1MwbPYK7vbCUQ7ADdbvq8eYkiRBydxKzLk"], "tags": ["nfts", "statue", "color", "3d", "cinema4d", "nftcollector", "art", "nft", "light", "blender", "3dart", ""], "extra": {}}
