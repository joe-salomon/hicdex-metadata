Plants first response to this treat was to produce poison to repel their attackers but that came at large energy costs, further reducing their chances of survival and reproduction. \nIt seemed that plants were at a dead end but evolution found the most effective solution: producing nectar to attract insects with an alternative and more beneficial food source while also facilitating pollination. \nThis evolutionary mechanism is nothing short of astounding as it shows that, if necessary, nature can change its structures to establish symbiotic relationships where, previously, only predation was conceived.\n.\n.\n.\nEmerging from the intersection of a neural net model trained on pictures of flowers with one which learned to generate insects, these enigmatic hybrid creatures celebrate nature power of reshape predation into a co-evolving symbiotic relationship.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdwHuNCcA71eS51YooFFj5vcoQVu5vNffrkrKx74avZ5U", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUftVADiRDAmXT2npQFNr2ae5i4kz8xAwY1mVFS2XA3N9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdwHuNCcA71eS51YooFFj5vcoQVu5vNffrkrKx74avZ5U", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1iGJRGN3v25PKQpHhHoxSHuxmvaEFqPQNf"], "tags": ["ai", "neuralnetworks", "gan", "generativeart", "aiart", "morph", "loop", "flower", "insect"], "extra": {}}
