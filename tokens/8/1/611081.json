But trust in yourself, the harder it gets, the stronger you become. Struggling with these things that seem to be so unfair at the time whenever we encounter them. I can tell you, from experience, these unfair moments were the best moments in my life. They made me realize I had so much to learn, and they taught me to not be so hard on myself anymore. We, as humans, expect a lot from one and another, therefore, raising the bar for those who are in the dark. You are enough. We are enough. You can only do your best, and that's more than enough. The good thing is, we aren't alone, even when we disappear into the darkness.\n\nThis photograph illustrates the power of the mental spirit we all possess. Today marks disclosure for 2021 and creates the opening for new opportunities that lie ahead in 2022.\n\nTo all of you: Happy Holidays, make it count, give your best, and remember; you're enough.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZWMXmnEwfjDYVntTbz1mxehM1WfdRFh8jKJ8YvboSQot", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmauWjhDZjMzXQzsC9BeXaAY9WksWXbvm3qTiK1ERowFJG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZWMXmnEwfjDYVntTbz1mxehM1WfdRFh8jKJ8YvboSQot", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LbKr1E8gj1tv9rsn1PuEwDmvy2Ff5qztP"], "tags": ["nye", "fireworks", "bestwishes", "motivation", "love", "peace"], "extra": {}}
