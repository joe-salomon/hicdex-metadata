Putting myself in e\u2019s shoes led to empathy. Which allowed forgiveness. Then acceptance. \u201ce\u201d will always be a part of me.  \n\nAll profits will support the important work of AFSP. My hope is that we can continue to bring suicide out of the darkness and remove the stigma and shame that can make healing so difficult. \n\nYou can find the full story @instagram/sentiment_project.
