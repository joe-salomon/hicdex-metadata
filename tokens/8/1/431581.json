She piles image upon image. Sometimes words upon words. For the last couple of decades, collage has been the primary architecture of an Anne Grgich artwork.

Collage and painted lines and shapes existed in an easy inter-relationship from which visual meaning emerged.\"-Colin Rhodes 2019 full article Raw Vision Magazine Woman Issue 103  https://rawvision.com/articles/balancing-books\n\nDigitzation of MM Collage on Birchwood physically available at Mason Fine Art Gallery, Atlanta, GA\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CRLoka5lWaf/?utm_medium=copy_link", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfZPwanXgQHf5RYS2JcKKXZFAB4NzFXkuJBcZmohMoJiJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPnULZo9CUe2gRwmZtXkNAYCnVcdkVixhW8XUtzQiNo7L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfZPwanXgQHf5RYS2JcKKXZFAB4NzFXkuJBcZmohMoJiJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2WWBPDBAjfagGSTCnVL8ZPRXnU7LGgjPoT"], "tags": ["#HEN#NFTCommunity#Cryptoart#Tezos#NFTartist#hicetnunc#nftcollectors#NFTArt#hicetnunc2000@onhicetnunc#NFTdrop#Crypto#cryptoartist#objkt#TEZ#1HEN1#HENP2P#nftcollector#Outsiderart#annegrgich#annemariegrgich"], "extra": {}}
