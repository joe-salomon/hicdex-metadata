With some, it was almost like love at first sight, I would immediately approach them as I noticed them. This is how it was with the flamboyant Anne Detry, whom I met at an opening and immediately saw the image of a living painting in front of me. Anne is well into her 70\u2019s, she studies languages, flirts and dresses in an adventurous style.\nOther women I met and learned to appreciate through the painting classes I teach. This created such a bond of trust and mutual appreciation that for me it was a small step to ask them to model for me. Women whom at first glance gave the impression to be rather introverted became an inspiration for my paintings.\n\nWith my paintings I can express these different experiences and highlight various aspects of aging. Some models were prepared to be interviewed and expressed their views on how they deal with aging, how they experienced it to be portrayed as aged, and what it does to them. Does the image correspond with how they experience their body?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWE61w7okSFQcx6ehpre8ah6ca2B4PwZ22oKRxhY5QFGk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNxen9cjW75pcCY5LqRFur3WBfx6TePUEy5CwLQf6nsCF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWE61w7okSFQcx6ehpre8ah6ca2B4PwZ22oKRxhY5QFGk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VyfBFYj7z9yryYR1oCbgqMhK2sfWDmdEn"], "tags": ["portrait", "oilpainting", "woman", "face", "figurative", "realisme"], "extra": {}}
