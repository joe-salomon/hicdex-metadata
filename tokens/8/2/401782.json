Through the use of plotholes or through dreams of abstract thinkers, they directly enter a story with one goal to peruse: destruction.\n\nAs a blank canvas, they carry no definitions of what they are, making them one of the most chaotic forces existing in that universe.  Only when they begin assimilating to surrounding targets are they constrained to something feasible and can begin physical interaction.\n\nWhen constrained, the invaders now comply to that universe's logic for a limited period of time. Their inherent chaos however gnaws at that order, and deliberately use that chaos to usurp, infiltrate, and devour everything without notice.  Once enough physics and cosmic order has been destroyed, they have the means to open the gateway, and bring the promise of destructive evanescence.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXtHfRGKAZ9ZVF41rrcvrNagr8FFwSMCqw8YnsKWXxeKz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSkuMetwaNTEmMtfrxURf92W2drgyYEsipRRQk14z26Fp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXtHfRGKAZ9ZVF41rrcvrNagr8FFwSMCqw8YnsKWXxeKz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1c5zHRTXNNrKXqFtVpV82xFzuVwQ3rSeki"], "tags": ["lovecraft", "omnidelirium", "occult", "tentacles", "monster", "horror", "chaos", "slime", "cosmic", "digital", "fantasy"], "extra": {}}
