If I did not give you light, you would be no good at all.\u201d\n\nBut the Moon answered:\n\n\u201cYou are only the Sun, and you are very hot. The women like me better, for when I shine at night, they go out doors and spin.\u201d\n\nThese words of the Moon made the Sun so angry that he threw sand in her face, and you can still see the dark spots on the face of the Moon.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3EZZ9XX7sz3gxzUHaMnxvyvgKbgEZYcjXm5bo1GVpmA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX4hYZekrdwEt7nnkCvZAAjcWmXeCMLuNaW58tXumqWwn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ3EZZ9XX7sz3gxzUHaMnxvyvgKbgEZYcjXm5bo1GVpmA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hd3VKEUD5P7nZagLTxfK21vBJvxPGSeRz"], "tags": ["illustration", "agamic", "folktale", "filipino", "art", "digitalart", "queerart", ""], "extra": {}}
