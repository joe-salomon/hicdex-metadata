It is the third offering from the debut album, State. The work and animations featured in the State series represent the rebirth as an artist and is the culmination of five years of work. \n\nThe album and animated series allowed a sense of liberation to create and make the Bases project what it is today. This work serves as the foundation. This is the third animation in the series and it has been exclusively minted here with 10 editions. \n\nMusic by Darryl Kirchner \nArtwork and Animation by Darryl Kirchner", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX5eEyzw7E9BFqiNj8EqKmBxdfn2MWWPBrkZg3xHpPTJ9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU9cfTLdZfr7qo9j1TSvBudp8Cstffm37HVuiVNXEwoH1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmU9cfTLdZfr7qo9j1TSvBudp8Cstffm37HVuiVNXEwoH1", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX5eEyzw7E9BFqiNj8EqKmBxdfn2MWWPBrkZg3xHpPTJ9", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1g9wxVbu5EKBeSqeGFoKSBnPKvxJnpKcsw"], "tags": ["animation", "acousticmusic", "music", "illustration", "glitch", "funk", "geometric", "nostalgia", "acoustic"], "extra": {}}
