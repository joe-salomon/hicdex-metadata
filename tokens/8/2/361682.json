I love watching and experiencing sunrises. Then everything looks different. Often shrouded in fog, doused in morning dew and illuminated by light that is impossible to see in the middle of the day. It is also the time when the senses of smell have their feast. After the night, all the scents of the sun are extinguished and the aromas of intense grasses, herbs, earth and forests come to the fore. This has to be experienced.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaqfywhWKSjc9BYsFyJTHFtGvfkC1YeXQAQQ5wrCrorRS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQFjJXBvZHQzfb3Cdj3GHQUVVkmqLRDimbd53qU6vAkL1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaqfywhWKSjc9BYsFyJTHFtGvfkC1YeXQAQQ5wrCrorRS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QGnFHUB1NX7mBvBDg85CMUrpXPWKLg4aW"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "colors", "saturation", "light", "beauty", "camera", "grass", "dew", "sunrise", "clearing"], "extra": {}}
