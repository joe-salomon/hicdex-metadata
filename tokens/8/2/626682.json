Of the few rooms in the castle open to tourists, supposedly one of the most haunted, is the bedroom of the Countess Agnes. Her bed, breastplate, and battle axe remain in the room, and legend has it that she died defending the castle from an \u201cundesirable\u201d suitor and, therefore, still haunts the German castle, found between the towns of Koblenz and Trier, today.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmekKLA7c8iPnGgU5hVMJvH95TkYqLGXGwEwEnJnuZNZQY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPYmwd4iA7zGeGZaXUzeHsL7rnzbJxtWLjbm8wkgtmiJM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmekKLA7c8iPnGgU5hVMJvH95TkYqLGXGwEwEnJnuZNZQY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PooUMzBR3sqhFhxEKPMsiXM4GzYLKDuho"], "tags": ["burg", "eltz", "ancient", "castle", "tezos", "xtz", "nft", "rare"], "extra": {}}
