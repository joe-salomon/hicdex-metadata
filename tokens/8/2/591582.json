The grounds feature a deep mall lined with cherry blossom trees and two sidewalks on each side leading to the capitol building itself. As I was trying to capture the falling leaves, I set up pointing down one of the sidewalks and kept the photograph. It was just OK, not a particularly compelling shot. Then one day, months later, I opened my files again and saw something hiding inside the original photograph. I saw a piece of artwork. This is the result. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVHonBCqESNwUPKG1KjviuWoJbw9LTcrZf7HKfC65e7zP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeDSTUugd5E1Vb2FEhhSRHFppujSLD6mhanaTsXRnycwn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVHonBCqESNwUPKG1KjviuWoJbw9LTcrZf7HKfC65e7zP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["cherryblossom", "photography", "digitalart", "digitalphotography"], "extra": {}}
