Providing Icelanders with a healthy snack that's full of protein and nutrients.\nHar\u00f0fiskur has been a staple in Icelandic diets for centuries. It\u2019s made by drying fish, most often cod, but also haddock and wolffish, in the cold North Atlantic air until it becomes cured by bacteria, similar to the process of maturing cheese. Once it\u2019s dried, the fish turns hard and yellow, and isn\u2019t really edible until it\u2019s pounded by a meat mallet, turning it into the softer har\u00f0fiskur that Icelanders know and love.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiei67ygujnqnoumka7ld2osu57dllaxyfje7kikcbmkefurrbhwqa", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibipqz5vqkacgruo6lo4sm2htgivjahmaq2q2pc2z6h6trijfbkhy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiei67ygujnqnoumka7ld2osu57dllaxyfje7kikcbmkefurrbhwqa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KhAGXM5GxQX2au4ox8qgC1B3w8W4tvnge"], "tags": ["iceland", "film", "mellback", "35mm", "fish", "landscape", "photography", "nftss", "island"], "extra": {}}
