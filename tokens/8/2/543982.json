Papuanus captures sunlight and turns into food just like plants, then its frog-like legs spread the fruits to the surrounding areas, which contain hundreds of seeds, making it possible to perpetuate the species.\nThe two heads of Papuanus each have a large brain, so they can communicate with all the other creatures on the planet through its roots, in order to keep the balance of the ecosystem. \n  ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUr2ea8fvkGUFAn1kyZqhp4KFPyHxLNGFY7KAkHFrXaLy", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc91EVyF7HBJV29GGnTQ2D5DJXUkFC4JiLycr5wfKe6fL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUr2ea8fvkGUFAn1kyZqhp4KFPyHxLNGFY7KAkHFrXaLy", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ro3NdaGmfMq9jZNtMUQnWMmA1goKiXPSv"], "tags": ["darwin", "crypto", "nft"], "extra": {}}
