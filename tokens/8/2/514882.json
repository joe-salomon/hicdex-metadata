A character of wisdom and knowledge.\n\nThe Dittiyah are a group of ever-present silent observers watching the universe at all times. They are imagineers and advocates of lucid dreaming. Without recompense they travel deep into the spiritual world. A seer was born to the Dittiyah who had an even more powerful foresight, capable of meeting intergalactic species. A future of peace was within grasp through the spiritual spectrum, and for many years the Dittiyah have been communicating across vast swathes of space with others. They are the children of wisdom and abandonment of selfish desire, but not all agree with the seers visions and a great fracture has occurred within Dittiyah society. Obstructed by a great political malevolence, the various factions of the Dittiyah have started to drift further apart in language, military actions and financial discussion.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ9ATxdkXo9BTVL7bXLiKKTvpX44wMBvZPviWmcgwUWjF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ9ATxdkXo9BTVL7bXLiKKTvpX44wMBvZPviWmcgwUWjF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ9ATxdkXo9BTVL7bXLiKKTvpX44wMBvZPviWmcgwUWjF", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1XGzUa2VeMr8nqzVGHhtGG7UU4uRgWHVTM"], "tags": ["characters", "life", "sentience", "animated", "nebula", "extraterrestrial", "visitor", "sentient", "alien"], "extra": {}}
