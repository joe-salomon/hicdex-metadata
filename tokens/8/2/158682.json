During this era of civil unrest and anti-war protests in Austin, the Ku Klux Klan received permission to march in a pro-Vietnam war demonstration.  They were received by a largely peaceful but quite loud opposing group of citizens and students during this moment of history. This photo shows the Klan members and anti-Klan protesters as the Klan is about to enter the Texas Capitol grounds off of Congress Avenue in downtown Austin. Taken with a Praktica FX2 camera on 35mm Kodachrome film.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXbYvMXKmntbXhCpYwKquWPRusg9EhnXJ7wQw8Zk5A7aV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZCLatcMcYPymUKR6X2jKt6xqJBshdYmXPi34vC2DNaNy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXbYvMXKmntbXhCpYwKquWPRusg9EhnXJ7wQw8Zk5A7aV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YmwJZfEerVMbc8uuJc7xUzE64ma3Xfu7L"], "tags": ["KKK", "Klan", "history", "protest", "Vietnam", "Austin", "Texas", "series", "peace", "60\u2019s", "civilrights", "anti-war", "city", "1965", "march", ""], "extra": {}}
