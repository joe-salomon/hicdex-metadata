They are waiting for the train to use as a means of transportation.\nit's a bit annoyed because the train is coming too late and there's a sloth as the driver. Fortunately them not lonely because there are other friends waiting for this train as well.. I believe that every wait has meaning, some people wait for their loved ones, some people wait for a chance to succeed in life. I'm rooting for every wait.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSUvbh2qNx98gpFQf8D8qu3Jux8mWDiYC4AwtAbvEsk3w", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbRw7i6TzAqHwifRgq1tWr2mLvt53i97FmZFUJXxTCpoA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSUvbh2qNx98gpFQf8D8qu3Jux8mWDiYC4AwtAbvEsk3w", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ayQZ6zuDKGMtMwvAsa5wLaA3totK1gUhg"], "tags": ["2d", "illustration", "cats", "machinesandrobots", "adventure", "fantasy"], "extra": {}}
