{"__version": 1, "token_id": 334482, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Handroanthus", "description": "The Handroanthus and Tabebuia trees (Bignoniaceae), native to Southwestern South America, herald the spring season by dramatically shedding all its leaves, blooming in a stupendous show of yellow, rose, lilac or white, depending on the particular species. It sheds all those flowers in just a couple days, then grows plentiful fruit and new foliage within just two weeks. Once dried, the fruit lets out numerous winged seeds to be scattered by the wind. This beautiful, dramatic and poetic tree is an unnoficial national symbol of Brazil, as it flowers a few days before local Independence Day, September 7th.
