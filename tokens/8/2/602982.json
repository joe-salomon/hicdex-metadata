Their room was on the forty-fifth floor. In the evening friends went to the theatre and came back to the hotel very late.\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d said the clerk of the hotel, \u201cbut the lifts don\u2019t work tonight. If you don\u2019t want to walk up to your room, we shall make beds for you in the hall.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d said one of the friends, \u201cno, thank you. We don\u2019t want to sleep in the hall. We shall walk up to our room.\u201d\nThen he turned to his friends and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to walk up to the forty-fifth floor, but we shall make it easier. On the way to the room I shall tell you some jokes; then you, Tom,will sing us some songs; then you, Peter, will tell us some interesting stories.\u201d\nSo they began walking up to their room. Tom told them many jokes;At last, they came to the thirty-sixth floor. They were tired and decided to have a rest.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Tom, \u201cnow it\u2019s your turn, Peter. After all the jokes, I would like to hear a sad story. Tell us a long and interesting story with a sad end.\u201d\n\u201cThe story which I\u2019m going to tell you,\u201d said Peter, \u201cis sad enough. We left the key to our room in the hall.\u201d", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcKVZAv8mmKzXR1vRiAWUdHKPB8ujwAZbKR6h3FKFgWuN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVnAcBRcYYNDQAKA6DVxXHqx38jfxQdBBz6Mt2asxtbYp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcKVZAv8mmKzXR1vRiAWUdHKPB8ujwAZbKR6h3FKFgWuN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1YqGwEGtqFjoJr4YwSC4vw295jSsCFRYvP"], "tags": ["illustrator", "drawing"], "extra": {}}
