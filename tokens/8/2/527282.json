The sage is offered to Gaia, Sky, the Cardinal Points, and the Heart of All.\nBurning sage is found to eliminate 97% of all toxins in the air. It clears the sinuses and stimulates manifestation. With the intention of connecting to one's ancestral guides, it can be a very powerful medicine, especially as a companion to ceremony and sacrament.\nThe song playing is my own, entitled \"Walking On Glass\" featuring Imuniti Music, which can be found on my SoundCloud or BandCamp! My name on there is Finesse The Matrix!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNSYZzWzXVkMMoo6LsQxwmUvkZ5LiSQeGD6bqy6SoB2TF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYwfhHssKNnZNgcP9HAnqKKgm86YALwnvHC5zUyj8qiwJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNSYZzWzXVkMMoo6LsQxwmUvkZ5LiSQeGD6bqy6SoB2TF", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1fyzeSfRFPnps1BjUQ5AMWdtkoj362Uuk2"], "tags": ["sage", "smudge", "clearing", "center", "breathe", "nature", "trees", "spirit", "medicine", "gaia", "interface", "meditate"], "extra": {}}
