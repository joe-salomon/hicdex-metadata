Each artwork belongs to a visual conversation made on DADA, the only platform in the world where people speak to each other through drawings, creating collaborative art.\n\nThis curated collection with a Halloween theme officially launched on October 31, 2017. It comprises 108 unique artworks made by 30 artists on DADA. The 2017 ERC20 Creeps have a total of 16,600 digital editions with 5 different levels of scarcity, which represent the significance of the visual conversations that the artworks belong to.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmennozPxioL3kEcVMV4wXicZTuWaJsFeEnE6tVinj2GS5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcniykH322YTKzutAYJfEwGWsuzVrPVKmdyxg2t4qEQAt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmennozPxioL3kEcVMV4wXicZTuWaJsFeEnE6tVinj2GS5", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1VThyJUrYAgjqmycTFWSdJ4T1hbs5okKkK"], "tags": ["dada", "drawing", "conversation", "2017", "ERC20", "collection", "catalog", "creeps", "weirdos", "halloween"], "extra": {}}
