The variety and complexity of these songs shows the expressive power of composing on a tablet using Alchemy synths, samples, aftertouch and kinetic soundshaping. Hearing them together here provides an opportunity to appreciate how the songs evolved and became more atmospheric as my confidence on the instrument increased.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRqnC8ukRQ4CnbjtLjaUU8bc3xbUEnb4JzZQHjb7EwrpK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbjdqsCrf8jUKfnyfJrYgAtZer9HERZZsD61kKDttLe7e", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRqnC8ukRQ4CnbjtLjaUU8bc3xbUEnb4JzZQHjb7EwrpK", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1e57mYNhy6j1ghhZCa3grjrMeFUuTtQkAM"], "tags": ["synthesizers", "garageband", "alchemysynths", "soundscapes", "ambient"], "extra": {}}
