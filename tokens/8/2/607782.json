While searching for answers to questions such as what am I and where did I come from, as I researched the names of the places where my grandparents were born, I realized that it had no meaning in Turkish and that its origins always came from Greek. The region is located on the Black Sea coast and its name is mentioned in history as Paphlagonia. When I examined the ancient coins in the cities in this region, I came across very interesting mythological figures. The thing that caught my attention the most was an eagle mounted on a dolphin, the eagle was not hunting him and they seemed to be hanging out together. As far as I know, the eagle symbolized Zeus and the dolphin symbolized Poseidon. In some sources, I learned that the union of the sky and the sea is also a metaphor for the union of man and woman. I couldn't think of anything else that would better describe the geography, the climate and my grandparents. No matter what I do, my path will always be where I came from and this image will always remind me of my grandparents. Rest in peace grandma and grandpa.\n\nIn memory of M\u00fcbeccel & Necati Bayram.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYRcigP6GDVv68EcMrMhHmFLxWKsGrqYftZdAojdenNi8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYRcigP6GDVv68EcMrMhHmFLxWKsGrqYftZdAojdenNi8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYRcigP6GDVv68EcMrMhHmFLxWKsGrqYftZdAojdenNi8", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YuyeYd9VhZ5QWR1Q9X8ikiRcmMCvmKJWw"], "tags": ["animation", "gif", "dither", "bitmap", "eagle", "dolphin", "mythology", "love"], "extra": {}}
