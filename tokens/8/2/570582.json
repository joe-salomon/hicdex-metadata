The test was carried out on November 1, 1952, at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of plutonium, 244 94Pu, which could only have formed by the absorption of six neutrons by a uranium-238 nucleus followed by two beta decays\n\n\nNew render - new Seed -  new look\n1:1 | 800x800 | 360 FRAMES | 25FPS\n\nUse the catalog to track down all the Atom Classics tokens\nhttps://www.pinterest.ca/XponentialdesignMarket/hicetnunc-nft/classic-atoms/\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRgYkT9v4sQLNA9E25PvHmnEkFgfMtNAK6mhyt2tAGgvK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRgYkT9v4sQLNA9E25PvHmnEkFgfMtNAK6mhyt2tAGgvK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRgYkT9v4sQLNA9E25PvHmnEkFgfMtNAK6mhyt2tAGgvK", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["proton", "atom", "loop", "element", "animation", "einsteinium", "mendeleev", "neutron", "classic", "science", "periodictable", "seamless"], "extra": {}}
