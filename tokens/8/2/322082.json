In this case, both sentences are valid sentences and work grammatically. The only difference here is that the letter \"I\" is separated from the word \"RAN\". Playing on proximity and the inherent context distance it alludes to we finD ourselves in a conundrum of sorts. We have one sentence that shows that I, personally, ran so far away and also the country IRAN is so far away from us in North America. Both factual statement and yet only one space can create completely different thoughts.
