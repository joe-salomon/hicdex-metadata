And when i already in front of them walking and said \"excuse me sir\" they screaming at me \"SIS, CAN YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF US?????\" \ni said \"ok! wait!\" \ni took out my camera strap from my neck and had my lens pop out to take this picture, i said \"of course lemme take the picture of you, stay still 1.. 2.. 3.. smile!\" and that's the result. And when i went back to their area i only found 1 of them doing their job as scavengers and give him the group photo print.\nThis photo give me such mixed feelings. \n\nusing ilford delta 400", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQsKe37ouvpJatgm71L1pbq6kodWCn9tDKA1gMbgr1e8u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQwMKMfWj9YhVc9ek5Vc7HccxudVkPPxEnY5J8CNnWcji", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQsKe37ouvpJatgm71L1pbq6kodWCn9tDKA1gMbgr1e8u", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e9NohRiKgi3TV7TW46zcc6tNB2wzbro5E"], "tags": ["#photez#bnw#filmphotography#nftphotography#nftasia#blackandwhitephotography#35mm"], "extra": {}}
