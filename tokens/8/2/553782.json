I was lucky enough to travel to Utrecht to study Rock and Water.  Rock and Water is a psychophysical resilience training and conflict resolution program taught all over the world. The Rock and Water method is proven effective by extensive academic research.\n\nBecause my kids faced severe bullying, I went to Holland to learn this course and now teach it in Israel. I think this is the real solution to bullying, and so do thousands of other people for whom it has worked all over the world.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about it - check out http://rotsenwater.nl and if you want to donate so I can further my studies and take more specializations so I can teach people here to teach, visit - http://bit.ly/rnweng", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcSCqmj7r6imLFZh4CH51fXmfwdJNcrrHP5Gz6wQSyBtB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPZojo2DMA91BeJrKF2Kqy2HT5tY3wJx8wvd3QVVTRALj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcSCqmj7r6imLFZh4CH51fXmfwdJNcrrHP5Gz6wQSyBtB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bFYtMPoL5PoYW6d3fRkUm7KcNH3o6SnTU"], "tags": ["holland", "netherlands", "rockandwater", "rock", "water", "photo", "photograph", "photography", "nature", "landscape", "charity", "bully", "bullying", "resilience"], "extra": {}}
