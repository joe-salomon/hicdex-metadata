Like sunflowers that always see and follow the movement of the rising sun, which is a sign of the start of the day, Monday is also a day where we seem to see a beginning in our lives and follow the flow of life that will lead us to everything that will happen this week. \n\nThat's why me, The Magician, and The Fool picked up some sunflowers at this beautiful garden. It's time to start everything with a new spirit!\n\nRemember, when life gives you Monday, dip it in glitter and sparkle all day ;)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP9ENrXyPrNq6Z2CX1fxdPDu54SKxjnbbUMb8KpoHFi8X", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcs1ASXAC1kizxfcCphrRZd15wn8PpiwxhV2whLPQf7M5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP9ENrXyPrNq6Z2CX1fxdPDu54SKxjnbbUMb8KpoHFi8X", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bExpjmLroNezLaFJVWFmA8FkC2kyMCS4P"], "tags": ["mondayartclub", "itsmondayart", "monday", "art", "illustration", "japan", "girl", "blue", "sunflower", "summer", "morning", "work", "happy", "thefool", "magician", "kadomeka", "routine", "monday"], "extra": {}}
