Material which passes through an area experience the same acceleration as previous packets did, but that acceleration is applied to a potentially different velocity. So while there's a channel-forming effect, its weaker than the direct term and really only shows up in the interactions between the green and red phases. The result looks a bit like Boussinesq flow - the sort of jets and vortices you get from a heated fluid rising in a cold medium. There is also a stronger tendency to observe wave-like behaviors with this kind of history, which you can sort of see in the way that the hollows in the initial layers fill in and bounce. / @ngutten\n\n2560 x 1440 mp4\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTzDbdynXaJZumUxCcwW7oZ38FMFF8QaSkndG2bwdmdNK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWePRWSrT8BRXWZTyKiAwjetVBu5iJ9ywwgbXK6MYceVp", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTzDbdynXaJZumUxCcwW7oZ38FMFF8QaSkndG2bwdmdNK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["fluid", "simulation", "advection", "cellularautomaton", "neural", "generative", "lavalamp", "video"], "extra": {}}
