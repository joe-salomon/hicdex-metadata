The playground's centrepiece is a huge brown tyrannosaurus, about 3m tall. I find it quite amusing to see big statues of dinosaurs in a quiet, older public housing estate.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf3Wn6cr1Lf2tVmAMNE7KoHmyAsvv5AXAJdGkqQ6jLfdG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXHRuo8Yth4XLTnRLbsjrddFzU2gMpYBqzCjx1AsxVQpE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf3Wn6cr1Lf2tVmAMNE7KoHmyAsvv5AXAJdGkqQ6jLfdG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WaFxNFPMiwzTaDX6Z6Gv6TemF2EbqcFnf"], "tags": ["illustration", "dinosaur", "playground", "childhood", "neighborhood", "singapore", "digital", "watercolor"], "extra": {}}
