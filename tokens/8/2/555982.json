{"__version": 1, "token_id": 555982, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "A PANGRAM IS A \"P\" ANAGRAM.", "description": "Talk about a sentence that defines itself in such a meta way that it is being in a mirror room. Oooooo conceptual fun time! Imagine being in a complete mirror room and seeing your reflection in every mirror in every possible direction, endlessly to what seems like forever. This sentence is the equivalent to that, but in words in a sentence. Let's break it down. Let's define what a pangram is first: (A pangram or holoalphabetic sentence is a sentence using every letter of a given alphabet at least once.) So now we know that, let's connect it to the latter part of the sentence; IS A \"P\" ANAGRAM. Focus on the first line and the third lines. See something? A PANGRAM is an anagram of \"P\" ANAGRAM. It's so mind-blowingly complex and yet so simple. It truly is like looking in a mirror in a mirror in a mirror in a mirror forever. You can't make this stuff up. It just exists regardless if I made this or not and that's really the craziest part of all of this.
