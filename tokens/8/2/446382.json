This sword is the result of their both blacksmiths, creating a unique sword taking inspiration from both shamshir and katana. The grip is wrapped like katana but the guard is more like a Hakhamaneshi sword. The habaki (blade collar) is carved with a \"Botejeghe\" also known as \"paisley\" design, showing a cypress tree as a symbol of life and eternity. The word \"Wind cutter\" is also written with both kanji and mikhi alphabet. There's a \"Zomorod\" gem planted on the pommel of the sword.\n\nThe sharper the blade the easer it breaks, this sword takes a great swordsman to be wielded, otherwise it may break. \n\nThere should have been a great catastrophe that two great kingdoms would want to combine their forces, what great evil were they going to face?\n\n2K rendered 60FPS  ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd9wjRcHSBATQNuauyx15Bn1BuPyVMq6qUabeLz5j6mwZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXNAYfXEjK6rkbqJbMnvzNZ4W4yVLBjn2DfJ6Qh1beHVa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd9wjRcHSBATQNuauyx15Bn1BuPyVMq6qUabeLz5j6mwZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MdXDde4Lrzb5RyEfVP3kDNsfqtRnEeMn9"], "tags": ["katana", "shamshir", "sword", "3d", "3dart", "animation", "2K"], "extra": {}}
