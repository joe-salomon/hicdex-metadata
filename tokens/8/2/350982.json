This collection arose gradually as I was drawing, painting, watching and reading about birds that I have a tremendous fascination of. Oftentimes I depict birds from mixing mythologies or legends or representing them in a symbolic and archetypical way. This piece is about cycles of transformation symbolized by Phoenix - life, death, rebirth continually in a cycle.
