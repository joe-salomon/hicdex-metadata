Their species features a full yellowed chest, contrasted by a gradient of greens to blues hue from the head to the back and extending through the wings' outer plumage.\n\nThey are known for living up to 35 years and mate for life. While this arauana is not considered an endangered species, in islands such as Trinidad and Tobago and some countries such as Paraguay, the population has been decimated to critical levels and reintroduction programs have been used to repopulate this amazing bird.\n\nIUCN Red List of Threatened Species status: https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22685539/131917270\n\nAs a means to support conservations efforts, 10% of the profits from the first sales of the fifteen pieces will go to Aviario Nacional project in Cartagena, Colombia.
