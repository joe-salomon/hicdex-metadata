Recently someone I know was mysteriously added to some kind of dark web chat on a popular messaging app. I can absolutely assure that this person had no involvement in anything remotely unsavoury. However with curiousity we perused, all kinds of fake documents for sale, drugs, even guns. I briefly toyed with the idea of creating some art inspired by this affair and attempting to sell it there. One group members profile was creepy collage of faces. However just before I put pen to paper shit got dark, really dark and I changed my mind. So here instead for your enjoyment is another mash up of faces incorporating an array of more positive and uplifting personalities. Mary Poppins, Jeremy Beadle, Mr Myagi, Ace Rimmer, Anneka Rice and Dipa Ma. Stay away from the dark side y'all. PS. 100 tez gets the original drawing too. Peace.
