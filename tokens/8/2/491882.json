Normally in a cellular automaton this is difficult because the discreteness of space and time is fundamentally part of the dynamics. By using diffusion and viscosity, it seems possible to smooth things out enough that zooming in by scaling up all the interaction radii starts to preserve the dynamics. / @ngutten\n\n2560 x 1440 mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZrTZXoi1qNQDnUfvD7nhtBEsTHQpDs1XqWqnywBn1hvo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcMwwGwxe8e9sCTTyLuwGuhsPNBA5Xa3WAcgt82RWrABN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZrTZXoi1qNQDnUfvD7nhtBEsTHQpDs1XqWqnywBn1hvo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["generative", "simulation", "advection", "cellularautomaton", "video", "galileaninvariance"], "extra": {}}
