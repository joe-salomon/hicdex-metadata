This burned out, abandoned house sat in a small barren wood in Louisville, KY. It was torn down shortly after this photo was taken.\n\nWhereas the 1st image of this house was toned brown, to suggest it was rejoining with nature as it decayed, this 2nd image is toned subtly green, to evoke an uneasy sense of sickness in the structure. \n\n35 mm film, circa 2001.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfQoKevv2ahHBh1dS27W1P5nffxiTHucAtuPEXy8HswRK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVTXvuY3Q5cwLkdfSr6pSE5rTfVrk52azD9pT3tWAWoT4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfQoKevv2ahHBh1dS27W1P5nffxiTHucAtuPEXy8HswRK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz29ZRzr7Le6QHCpj3WwH67bEBZhfb1edpEo"], "tags": ["b&w", "abandoned", "photography", "film", "house"], "extra": {}}
