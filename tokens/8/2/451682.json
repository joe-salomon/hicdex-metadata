The Towers are generated with natural stone patterns along algorithm of \"substrate\". The original pattern is highlighted with lines constantly. The camera is flying around the towers elliptically.  Tops of the towers are grown from the 150 cells of \"substrate\" with 3d extrusion of  random seed 4543. The base plane is intersected with towers and moving as dark sections in between the base and tops.
