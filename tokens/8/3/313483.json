{"__version": 1, "token_id": 313483, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BE HERE NOW (LSD TRIP)", "description": "BE HERE NOW is a visual representation of my recent LSD experience.\nIt came with a lesson that each passing moment is a reminder to be fully present in the here and now. When you truly live in the moment, it feels as if the world was unfolding as a magical spectacle for you. In this way you see others for who they are without the risk of taking anything or anyone for granted.\nI took my LSD tab with my significant other under the starry sky of British Columbia, Canada. The tunes like Bold As Love (by Jimi Hendrix), Perfect, Perfect (by East Forest) and the Wedding Theme from 'Candy' (by Johnette Napolitano) turned out to be the soundtrack for the night, making our hearts beat in rhythmic and ecstatic ways, supporting us in weaving our story and imprinting it onto the field. We had our magic carpet ride feeling as if we were traversing the Universe and experiencing different lifetimes together. Psychedelic journeys are beautiful reminders of what really matters in life and how immortal our soul is. I hope this artwork inspires you to be here now, fully savouring each moment as it passes, creating memories of abundance and love forever.
