(NEWS FLASH: I failed miserably!) Turns out I have no idea what contemporary teenagers are going through these days...shocker. Just by moving the AN from Andrew over from right to left and combining it with Uncle we get UNCLEAN. What's crazy about this one is they are the same length, same letters, same amount of spaces in between. They are basically identical to each other and yet hilariously different meanings. English allows this; it's bewildering and I never get tired of it.
