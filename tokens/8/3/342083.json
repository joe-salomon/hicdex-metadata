But instead of rigid surfaces being generated by greater distance between lines and points, they are instead formed by the shortest possible line between points - a dynamic field of quanta. Being entities of potential, they function as a single part of an entire wave and do not resist to move in tandem with it. Intruding upon this collective wave of flux is not immediately disruptive, but once put into action, the energy within the system builds exponentially leading to the return of a great wave of energy that merges with the intruding entity\u2019s quanta and scatters it as the wave settles once again.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWrSoaRdaj5vxUrmUoogukuiidCisjUcmbKYgbx5HixZ6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfQtjCed49YsUT3RTGMQBB54L4YConuXErUkStviJWvLD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWrSoaRdaj5vxUrmUoogukuiidCisjUcmbKYgbx5HixZ6", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bAocPoQKdzpsWdN2BxAC3jR32PhqZkX57"], "tags": ["digitalpainting", "graphicdesign"], "extra": {}}
