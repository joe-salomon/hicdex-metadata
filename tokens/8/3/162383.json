Since then this design has been screen printed on to thousands of T-shirts, sold on clothing to people around the world, and has even changed people's lives. For example my friend got 3 corrupt cops fired after they beat him up in jail with night sticks until he was bloody for wearing one of these shirts in the drunk tank. He got a lawyer, took it to court and they lost their jobs. My friend had to sign a non-disclosure agreement about it so no news outlets would have the story but that don't mean I can't talk about it. I am now sharing this design as an animated digital artwork to further spread the message of holding law enforcement accountable for their actions. Made with yellow and dark blue screen print ink on red cotton t-shirt fabric. Digitally animated with Canva and Imovie.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUhaQLfvcp2xvq8WhTYtfdLdpVV2E5fisRZV91JQuk2mq", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc9kXug7XKYHMiGu3ofYEFxd1Zboc21zxdVJ4EEbU42a8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUhaQLfvcp2xvq8WhTYtfdLdpVV2E5fisRZV91JQuk2mq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WgRYtnUEef82jpA9DA13gztjEqkWYsWhn"], "tags": ["IllustrationDigitalart"], "extra": {}}
