We can sometimes rest on the laurels of our past or let pride prevent us from growing as a person or moving on into new directions; And sometimes we can even forget the reason why we started on this creative flight through these artistic skies. \n\nIt\u2019s important that we take the time to check in with ourselves, to make sure we are on a path that we enjoy, that motivates us for the right reasons, and in the end, we are focusing on our art and our own personal artistic journey. \n\nWe all don\u2019t want to end up flying too close to the sun, like poor Icarus, losing our wings, and drowning in a sea of what ifs and what might be. If we carve out the time to reflect on where we've been and where we are going, we can perhaps avoid those pitfalls the myth of Icarus serves to warn us about.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXpsK4oy3ZMYXfEknxhhiTcRUqawSwUz973syjwvmFoiP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXpsK4oy3ZMYXfEknxhhiTcRUqawSwUz973syjwvmFoiP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXpsK4oy3ZMYXfEknxhhiTcRUqawSwUz973syjwvmFoiP", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hMpzadgcgpUiDf5N6YXzMmDryWHKkaPuy"], "tags": ["2022", "Abstract", "Glitch", "Colourful"], "extra": {}}
