He places his hand on each horses\u02bc back and each horse buckles under his strength and their bellies touch the ground, then he sees a young foal, brave as a lion, as tall as a camel, as strong as an elephant. No one knows who the foal belongs to and no one can catch him. Rustam is the only one who can catch and saddle the foal. He says that the foal will be his war horse and calls the foal \" Rakhsh\"\nRakhsh is the stallion of protagonist Rustam in the Persian national epic, Shahnameh of Ferdowsi. The color of Rakhsh is described as ' rose leaves that have been scattered upon a saffron ground' and it is first noticed by Rustam amongst the herds of horses brought over from Zabulistan and Kabul.\n\n\n\n-", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZtG12CgL5vXe2tdGNXHeowJFXqk5T7YC5iwh6uYVgM4H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdejbsuzWq5K2ofgQF1ag98m1HDDKzwadNRjYx54HMhZF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZtG12CgL5vXe2tdGNXHeowJFXqk5T7YC5iwh6uYVgM4H", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["collectable", "colorful", "character", "illustration", "2d", "cute", "rosstam", "generative"], "extra": {}}
