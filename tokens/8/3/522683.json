He is best known by many for his illustration of Cosette from Les Mis\u00e9rables by Victor Hugo.\n\nWhile there had been art depicting spaceflight and alien worlds prior to 1865, they were based heavily on mysticism as opposed to science. Bayard's artwork accompanying From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne is considered among the first Space art of a scientific nature. via Wikipedia\n\nThe drawings of \"From the Earth to the Moon\" impressed me so I made a collage of his. Maybe his drawings also took us to the moon.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmasU6UA5GwWsqwsoCUVLWh9bvRqJXgFXGyVtdQ58uJ7Cb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP4rzeS1b47Krh4zmjEcv1PoopY1w7fbmx1Nm95wu11h5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmasU6UA5GwWsqwsoCUVLWh9bvRqJXgFXGyVtdQ58uJ7Cb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ULFbYs5KoAdoySxg7A6YUt2jruA5vbxNX"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
