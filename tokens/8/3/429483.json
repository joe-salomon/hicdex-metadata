This series is my reflection to what solitude and being with yourself means.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve been raised and taught to pair up with our partner, family, friends or other person in everyday life, we sometimes feel it\u2019s weird to be with ourselves. We often forget to connect within and make friends to the soul.\n\nThese pics were taken during my time trying to understand who I am and what I\u2019m gonna do with my life. While navigating through all those never-ending unanswered questions, my body and emotion asked me to slow things down and experience stillness.\n\nPhotography has helped me understand stillness in its very mode so that I have some travelling archive I can look up to. It also allows me to look into who I was and who I am today. And for those reasons, this \u201cSoul, Solitude\u201d exists.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYahfyNC2meoMvD9KfjAnpdx7CxWnEzBN3miecMVyqARe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVQnkgUW2UQghCSN3bX6sDXALQRUaYeuAK3f81rLZHsXa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYahfyNC2meoMvD9KfjAnpdx7CxWnEzBN3miecMVyqARe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2JB6ZweygFSyBGAGzaHL83376oDX3Ntk6N"], "tags": ["Photography", "NFTPhotography", "Nature", "Photographer", "NFTPhotographer", "Soul", "Solitude", "Wellness", "Blue", "Beach", "Sky"], "extra": {}}
