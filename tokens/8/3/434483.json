Since he is the only one and true God, he has every right to be worshipped. His essence is unavoidable.\n\nThen they, His servants are returned to Allah, their true Lord. Unquestionably, His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of accountants. (Quran 6:62)\n\nThat is because Allah is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He is over all things competent (Quran 22:6)\n\nSo exalted is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth; there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne. (Quran 23:116)\n\nThat Day, Allah will pay them in full their deserved recompense, and they will know that it is Allah who is the perfect in justice.
