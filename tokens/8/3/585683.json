It is so common for women to be the main messengers of gossip. I don\u2019t want to hide, I like to gossip and I do it tastefully. For example, with a delicious cocktail, in a pleasant atmosphere and with people close to me. But there\u2019s never anything wrong with this conversation. I just blow off steam with my girlfriends and share news. But gossipers aren\u2019t always as harmless as they seem. And in my series \u00abNeon Union\u00bb I want to tell you about types of gossip , and you decide for yourself, maybe you are one of them?\n\n\nThe first type is gossip fleeting. \nHe may not be the true gossip. It\u2019s just that in cold times, he mimics to protect himself, to have a conversation, or to increase his value. This harmless dude shares news and sometimes doesn\u2019t even notice he\u2019s started gossiping, because this conversation has no subtext or anger.\nSuch a friend surely met you in your life and  often you are the first  type\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNpZn177AKCnk8SWxDt1upXBBNkARnGk287pELdHBWcnM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfRkpzRd2tVnziVUXibyPAdMkXajKCBBoYVB3tucbAqF2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZDumZ8QGSTR21FAqyap9vqa3B5BcdLzdRDyzueobZBmu", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNpZn177AKCnk8SWxDt1upXBBNkARnGk287pELdHBWcnM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["#neon#gossip#types"], "extra": {}}
