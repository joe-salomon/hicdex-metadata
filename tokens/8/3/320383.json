{"__version": 1, "token_id": 320383, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Am I a winner?", "description": "I am a winner, you are a winner, we are all winners! Life is sweet. No alarm clocks, no bosses, no bullsh*t.\n\nBut is everyday great? Maybe not. That's when you need a one-of-one \"You are a winner!!\" NFT. With that in your collection life will be one long ride on the happy train.\n\nHow do you get it?\n\nBuy one, or some, or a boat load of \"Am I a winner?\" NFTs. When the last is sold, a lucky soul is selected at random* and receives \"You are a winner!!\". \n\n\n* The nerdy bit:\nSelection is off-chain and may take a couple of hours after the last sale, but it is provable fair: `printf \"ADDRESS OF FINAL PURCHASER\" | shasum -a 256 | head -c 16`. This hex is converted to decimal and then modulo 10,000 to get a number from 0 to 9999. The (N+1)\u1d57\u02b0 purchaser of \"Am I a winner?\" gets \"You are a winner!!\".\n\nComing next in the series is \"You are great!!\". We end the fun with \"You are a lucky soul!!\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR6gQmidcL8e8Mf8VwA4HefHZ12gjP6wqCHAiRNtxyth5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXrGK4U3u5fcfAT94CHdfJVLows53ZNJ5VXJvF5oAtN8W", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR6gQmidcL8e8Mf8VwA4HefHZ12gjP6wqCHAiRNtxyth5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QMEsqigV8xruZ3zM1kFxn5wYPtVK4s8yJ"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
