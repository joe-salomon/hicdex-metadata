The reproduction is a beautiful object of the early twentieth century and is therefore in fact an antique find in itself. A find that represents an older find, which in turn represents the timeless icon of classic femininity. The head was scanned with a photogrammetry device, then processed in a 3D environment and remapped with new imaginative, lush, and colorful textures, all deriving from my original freehand or digital drawings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPSMqEnYob23Ua59WPrU5cmyWzrg3jE2BH3PUqUovEomi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP8co5vBz84UzyfKkC6BpoTskzyMj4LeRP3grKjKp82ak", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPSMqEnYob23Ua59WPrU5cmyWzrg3jE2BH3PUqUovEomi", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1amsgMaX2kYNLHMttB26Rf1EXmy5eJAwZG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dsculpture", "virtualsculpture", "virtualreality", "augmentedreality", "3dmodel"], "extra": {}}
