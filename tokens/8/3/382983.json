I\u2019m inspired by everything that I remember from my past and what I wish for our future. Influences vary between my Caribbean culture, the current climate crisis, my passion for themes such as futurism, biomimicry, and solar-punk\u2026 and of course my experience as a Designer who has been working for more than a decade on human-computer interactions, AR/VR, and haptics. I hope that my love for sci-fi, gaming and storytelling will transpire through this project as well.\n\nI decided a year ago during the pandemic to delete all my social media accounts mainly as part of a research project focused on human behaviours. Now, I\u2019m excited to come back and start sharing some of that work with the public. I intend to do so with a new mindset and framework aligned with my own boundaries and values around vulnerability and empathy. I hope that this inspires some of you. I have zero expectations, simply love for my art.\n\nThis first post showcases visuals created earlier today, following the #Inktober2021 1st prompt: #Crystal.\n\nYou can follow my work on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, Reddit, and Dribbble under the username @ManuVision.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSurcgECeBqdfEVjLv5MkkJ9XpMKxW8M4LcK21fxNmNtA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVv8PWCsRDAH1yDVh7j4jCo769TmM6S4DRt6cgwJPSiJj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSurcgECeBqdfEVjLv5MkkJ9XpMKxW8M4LcK21fxNmNtA", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hbcn3CV8X5kUp4QBmcWCuRLAEJoDqctbp"], "tags": ["b3d", "blender", "3dmodeling", "blender3d", "lowpoly", "isometric", "inktober", "inktober2021", "inktoberday1", "crystal", "dribbble"], "extra": {}}
