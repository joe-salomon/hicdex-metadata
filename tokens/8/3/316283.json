My first impression when saw his painting,  I felt a very intense tension.  It would be interesting for me to put an element of fun there because the painting is contrary with my illustration style.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZgfwJZGLvLuApndjdTdbJ3NjpZNNSxUhZLHfYs6Awg9G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ6M6n7gBkJoG45ZKhnSjAGawfzzsDzC7gWPq1DsDHfZi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/quicktime", "uri": "ipfs://QmZgfwJZGLvLuApndjdTdbJ3NjpZNNSxUhZLHfYs6Awg9G"}], "creators": ["tz2U8ZDDQoejna1hDaE6fZTmkQX5JpQXWoGR"], "tags": ["Motion", "illustration", "radensaleh", "bantenghunt", "sinrgi", "rosyad_a", ""], "extra": {}}
