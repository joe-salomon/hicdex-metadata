Other than cargo coming in and out, visitors who come around sometimes take their time at the cafe, or just chilling around this beautiful little island. Very close to the main island is also a smaller one. Generally young lovers go there to have a little... privacy I assume.\n\nNote: 2 strange occurrences have happened on Island 02 that I must address.\n\n+ There is a local myth about some sort of large octopus/squid-like creature. Locals say it is friendly, but very rarely seen.\n\n+ The other is a young man had gone missing during the early settlement of this Island a couple years ago. It is said his ghost still wanders the island.\n\n\n- Port Island_02 is part 2 of the Port Island series\n2048x2048 pixel .gif\n\nBurak Parlak, 2021\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQgZAT6foULaXc5E5Z2NgLU86ZBEgzzr325RSicZtkB9R", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmawmSQzSwJJL5XgHg3SecHMD4sCvna7zeQBwm6AHjMUMA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQgZAT6foULaXc5E5Z2NgLU86ZBEgzzr325RSicZtkB9R", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NNm1PE1WuBQE5F1qhqcvPFHiQWppFmNH8"], "tags": ["island", "illustration", "420", "detailed", "animation", "technology", "weed", "marijuana", "cannabis", "hemp", "ghost", "creature"], "extra": {}}
