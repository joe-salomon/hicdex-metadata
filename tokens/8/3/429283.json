The same technique he used in his \u201cDans Paris\u201d painting series, where he visualized the vibrating sounds of the language he didn\u2019t understand into a portrait. The pasted words represent the wandering thoughts that appear wildly in one\u2019s head.\n\nThis piece is hand-drawn digitally using a stylus pen in the Sketchbook program on an iPad Pro device.\n\n2048 x 2048 px\njpeg\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Me\u201d Series\nTeguh Ostenrik in collaboration with @dettytoski\n \nIn a contemplation space, what does it mean to save oneself? It's just ironic as there's no cure. And I start reflecting on my life. The power I can have. The thought to escape and take control. I'll turn your world into ash and treat you like you're the lamb. You can sit here wallowing in your ignorance. Looking for any reason, you can deny. Because life and death decisions are once yours but the two sisters will no longer hurt me.\n \nIn this series, Ostenrik portrays the contrast of bright neon colours as the struggle one most often has in dealing with Bipolar Disorder. The battle to survive the bewildering highs and lows in the brain turbulence is represented in each bold stroke.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYMbRgcGP6HaY1DHwbgpyZZKWcemsLVghfo8WQ6CbEeve", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUhTLyTQyDgFRinWBUeCEk48axMmzuEi3hgCqNe7UMb7U", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYMbRgcGP6HaY1DHwbgpyZZKWcemsLVghfo8WQ6CbEeve", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1drUotShUZUMxd9DNk2HpeJ44wtuqNr2Rt"], "tags": ["#NFTartist#NFTcollector#NFTcollections#hicetnunc2000"], "extra": {}}
