Ignoring? \nRejecting someone you love deeply? \nAre you isolating yourself from others? \nEngaging in behaviour that pushes loved ones away? \n\nThis stems from huge pain that we feel we can only manage if we ignore the problem. Usually we feel there is nothing we can do so we turn away. Sharp edges cut when we act like this, the mirroring that we create in others through our behaviour does too and it can be very painful. Denial is a coping mechanism to deal with pain, bury it, forget about it, it will go away. These are survival instincts. Denial will eventually surface in one form or another, and if you don\u2019t turn and face it whatever it is might come and bite you in the ass. Turning around and just looking for now is enough. Just look at it from afar, what is it really? What is going on? Just look at it objectively with no pressure to do anything about it. Be compassionate and forgive yourself. Move forward slowly with kindness for yourself and those involved. \n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT33TpH1FJfQmUYKEGWYXDoJndyv7mL8PVHvbSbHoYWZe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdBKSXwic3WffN995Dm1GjUrZCRAtK7eVjP3VRQ8QGAHM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT33TpH1FJfQmUYKEGWYXDoJndyv7mL8PVHvbSbHoYWZe", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
