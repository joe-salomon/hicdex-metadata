The slits and holes in Monstera leaves are called fenestrations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVAZB7n3Dv2aPiq5o7As6yLeYUjKTARMFRwT6CU3x46zP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVAZB7n3Dv2aPiq5o7As6yLeYUjKTARMFRwT6CU3x46zP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVAZB7n3Dv2aPiq5o7As6yLeYUjKTARMFRwT6CU3x46zP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XaZnd81MzUMtVNiokyeTkyVGjrqdjsjHa"], "tags": ["plants", "green", "mosteradeliciosa", "monstera", "plant", "flowers", "flower"], "extra": {}}
