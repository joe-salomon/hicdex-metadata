Abstraction 02_21 is dedicated to the \"Metaball\", \"Voronoi diagram\" and \"Delaunay triangulation\" transformations as well. The patterns are linked in specific way to draw the algorithmic abstract artwork with each other. The energy of abstract processes in relationship of algorithms is linked. Eight charged points are divided in two groups and are transforming the space around.
