Buy TREEs you want to add or remove (if you don\u2019t have spare ones)\n\n2. Send FOREST you want to change and TREEs you want to add or remove back to creator\u2019s address. Burning works too, but don\u2019t forget to contact @badfoxlab to get your upgraded FOREST\n\n3. If you end up making a new combo you will receive FOREST ~ORIGINAL~. If ORIGINAL or GENESIS combos already exists you will receive an edition of FOREST ~UPGRADED~\n\n4. Please don\u2019t send/burn two and more FORESTs at the same time, I haven\u2019t figure out the best mechanics for that", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbbfP6Fn5dwFLtHL8ygi927zpoPttU6EaoTpLFmnxxyuu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbbfP6Fn5dwFLtHL8ygi927zpoPttU6EaoTpLFmnxxyuu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbbfP6Fn5dwFLtHL8ygi927zpoPttU6EaoTpLFmnxxyuu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ernWVEvNPFTEKqzwMdSMoYfJiv1gLTBh7"], "tags": ["1bit", "tree", "pixelart", "pixels", "1bittreecollection", "1bitforestcollection", "1bitforestgenesis", "minimalism", "earthday", "cleannft", "retro", "ecoart", "aseprite", "tiles"], "extra": {}}
