It is a small artificial neuron in the shape of a cube, it can connect and communicate with 4 Trillion other Enigmas in its vicinity using its microscopic quantum communication tunnels.What makes them dangerous is thier ability to clump together and act as a single unit with exponentially increased processing power. geez, it can move however it wants to, can teleport to other places, convert parts of itself into every element in every form, making it the most versatile, powerful sentient being in existence. A small clump of Enigmas could help to terraform a entire planet, larger clumps the size of cars could even set out to explore the depths of the universe. Psst Psst, these enigmas just learnt that they could convert and trap humans into thier special cyber voids where they can simulate entire universes an drop you in it and have fun.\n(< thESe EnIGmas CanNot AtTack aND tRaP huMAns iF tHey haVe OnE of ThIS #daRkMOrPh oBjKT. bE saFE, gEt a DarK mOrPh >)\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQJh66nvu3ANMHX44VxZreaJj2tmZMFVaPMXtraGLSsMU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXNJESzZLksRNZB4qazJm5k7PFmAzz8sui2oqm95Vtrh6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQJh66nvu3ANMHX44VxZreaJj2tmZMFVaPMXtraGLSsMU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1NcMbj4TwYiXoHj64zCaEe277RqBVVWCcV"], "tags": ["digitalart34"], "extra": {}}
