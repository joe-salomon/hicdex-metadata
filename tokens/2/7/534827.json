The journey and the experience. The travel from point A to point B becomes negligible in exchange for convenience or computational assurance. Giving Up On The Space Between explores methods of transitions through various machine-generated paintings. The AI model attempts to find the similarities between the artworks and paint the hidden divergent spaces. We must be the custodians of the interpolations between our thoughts and our actions; even when implemented via machine.\n\n[SOUND ON] 1024 x 1024 pixels, 2 minute 8 seconds | Ryan Thompson, November 2021 | www.ryanthompson.name", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXfWuz1Li6Ay3vCu1Lw3Qub8Nh8eo4eF5m6hqxoQRT7To", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWpbXqoxWesYpa8LHQSqUBDKE7Xbxc9AEry34daL5bKv9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXfWuz1Li6Ay3vCu1Lw3Qub8Nh8eo4eF5m6hqxoQRT7To", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1YokFzMR1hX4m4aBqgutxLSUKFDdNoYGEN"], "tags": ["ryanthompson", "machinelearning", "generative", "ai", "artificialintelligence", "loop", "motiondesign", "creativecode", "computerart", "code", "computationaldesign", "neuralnetworks", "gan", "postphotography", "aiart", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
