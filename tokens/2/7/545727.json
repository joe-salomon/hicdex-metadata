My modus operandi has been influenced as usual by my surrealist and cartoonist eye with a big influence from tatoo art. Each work represent a different section of the planet earth, as if a knife would cut the planet to show its hidden secrets. The horror style aims to transmit the feeling of being in the Forest, Ocean, Montains, Microcosmo and Circus. Each time if you look deeper into habitat works you can find hidden easter eggs and different reading keys.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZFkgKKFysuskVidMYXvYN8yEhGYH1EuuaFTbCAfn2zvi", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSj5dNYtpXmfWdxef6Na7NqGyfgbQ8HJdd48BuvRngPXZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZFkgKKFysuskVidMYXvYN8yEhGYH1EuuaFTbCAfn2zvi", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2EfCBRWAgVAqFDmb9f1ULS1KxtU9hArZk3"], "tags": ["naturenft", "art", "hen", "surrealism", "illustration", "cleannft", "badmandala", "blackandwhite", "nftart", "nftcommunity", "earth", "mandala", "drawing", "nftcollector", ""], "extra": {}}
