{"__version": 1, "token_id": 348627, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MASTERY", "description": "Insights from the Dreaming Pool - Hone your skills. What is the ultimate mastery? The mastery of yourself. Knowing who you are, your strengths and your weaknesses. knowing what skills you already have and which ones you need to learn. Wisdom understands we are all continuously learning and at some point you may realise everything you've done has accumulated into mastery. The squares in this drawing relate to the squares that fell from card no 36 in this deck, The Wall. Using what we've learnt to survive can be used again in a different way with Mastery of the self. The stubbornness, strength, aggression or intense focus that kept you protected will be transformed and used again in the energy of flow. Nothing is wasted in nature. Here all of your skills and understandings about yourself come together with elegance and beauty, which are at the heart of Mastery. It is seamless, fluid and efficient.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfNmg2BafNW4vV8DVjQskoBH5rX5ZCLTTh2uecYQcqz7w", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSZGFohsnXLhWv4AVWxpdVdN8XKsNPVinnkwn1m1UG9Tg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfNmg2BafNW4vV8DVjQskoBH5rX5ZCLTTh2uecYQcqz7w", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
