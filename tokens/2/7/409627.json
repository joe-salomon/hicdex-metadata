I keep telling myself that I will revamp & start over because I'm really looking for consistency & a foundation with the different styles I want to approach. This one doesn't have a specific title, and I'd imagine that many won't unless I base the digital abstract piece off a particular idea...but if today would start as a renewal for @no5ay_..then it's safe to say this is simply #number1. Thank you for your attention & if collected, feel free to tweet it out so I can retweet and thank you for the very very very much appreciated support. \n\nTrying to navigate through social media & learn about the art+nft space as I continue to deal with social anxiety, which makes community building a little difficult on my end, BUT I'm slowly working at it on these platforms and hope that this journey could eventually rid of these long time fears that I've dealt with. For more artwork from my \"no5ay_\" collection & other art experiments, check me out in the twitterverse! \ninstagram: @no5ay_\ntwitter: @no5ay_", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNSCr4N1pZxAbxPCeCzZYzJFXhqN3W3Px81ECb7LsghVq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUBkVVwDhkYgRf2tcGj9JinrrfUKeRhAPhXfX59nrdCLm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNSCr4N1pZxAbxPCeCzZYzJFXhqN3W3Px81ECb7LsghVq", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MVGesL1NyxCCdd3Fn5W8dPvgEL5n2bwwc"], "tags": ["no5ay_", "digital", "art", "abstract", "paint", "collage", "color", "october", "expression", "experiment", ""], "extra": {}}
