{"__version": 1, "token_id": 483727, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "HEARTWARMINGEST", "description": "Making abstract concrete poetry based upon specific rules and form has its roots in traditional poetry and even just the basic human need/want/desire to be a story telling machine. We can't help but make stories to rationalize our existence. Even if it's so abstract that the form and/or story take on a life of its own; enter HEARTWARMINGEST. When we combine certain words that share letters we can create a narrative that never existed before. Let's take the word HEARTWARMING (Causing gladness and tender feelings.) & combine it with INGEST (To take in and absorb as food.) One of the resulting sentences that can appear are: I INGEST A WARMING WAR HEART, ARMING IN ART; IN GEST. A lot could be extrapolated just from that one sentence. One could interpret it as: It's the ritual meal before going into the void of emptiness and battling nothingness; eating my passionate heart of truth, armed with the tools of creation; a fight for a verse in my romantic exploits of art. Or you could read it however you want. The point is let's open our minds to the possibility that there's always a different way of seeing and/or reading something, especially poetry.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXrJ9qNc7k5Et4YEEFGNiP9owhQXZ2jddWqp4gTBDWDJt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ8XkkcXPJsH6S6HjKkGLvXbe7D5pzxCaDSZCzm74EKrT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXrJ9qNc7k5Et4YEEFGNiP9owhQXZ2jddWqp4gTBDWDJt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
