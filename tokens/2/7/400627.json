Their sound was something like a contemporary cross between Rage Against The Machine & A Tribe Called Quest. All 5 members of the group were Army-brats of American GIs that married local women from Baghdad. The unusual pairing of political metal/hard rock and lyricism of hip hop infused beats created a dynamic range that truly speaks of daily life for Elder Generation Z youth. Raffallaffal would have brought the house down with sick riffs and poignant slice of life raps.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3DafqyC1AV2sT3bUBLg5bTyRnc2ozsjEGdu4DgxB3ZH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT5jJpA5pjNPQA9omb3gRG6F2gyNN8H9vWqD4wy8uCerV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ3DafqyC1AV2sT3bUBLg5bTyRnc2ozsjEGdu4DgxB3ZH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
