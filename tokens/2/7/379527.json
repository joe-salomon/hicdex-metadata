Anyone who is aware of what is happening and who tries to wake up other people is a Bodhisattva. We are all Bodhisattvas, doing our best.\u201d-Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nWe are all here for enlightenment and helping  enlighten others. A Boddhisatva is a Buddha who experiences Nirvana, ultimate bliss, enlightenment. But doesn\u2019t stay there, comes back, and shows the others the way. They understand that both worlds are the same. \n\nThat is what is happening here, and there. Both visually and spiritually. \n\nYou are right where you are supposed to be. \n\nMusic by @robotkingpin", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7BYf5Xo46ymrjr9BnAGRpVadQCAfSvHjW3uUZczwtbU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPMvL7RfzbfXMuHwUqJPJLr8U7ufm9bREhRZBHuLnvR2w", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf7BYf5Xo46ymrjr9BnAGRpVadQCAfSvHjW3uUZczwtbU", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ge711j5nJ33qvnMUZZJCF1VTUsTkntFo3"], "tags": ["buddha", "everything", "nothing", "void", "womb", "universe", "iridescence", "fourfacesbuddha", "particles", ""], "extra": {}}
