{"__version": 1, "token_id": 464027, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Solar Eyes Project | The Saturn", "description": "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (\u2644) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for \u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century.\n.\nDistance from Sun: 1.434 billion km\nOrbital period: 29 years\nSurface area: 42.7 billion km\u00b2\nRadius: 58,232 km\nMass: 5.683 \u00d7 10^26 kg (95.16 M\u2295)\nLength of day: 0d 10h 42m\nMoons: Titan, Enceladus, Mimas, Hyperion, Iapetus, Rhea, Dione, MORE", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWcbJAJzDDrSQeZWzZjm4qXCPCxfswJpabSWbwNrwuHh4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR5PRBH11tcdknBUk7du1hSUYV4SQ6iTJM62cQyNdysfC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWcbJAJzDDrSQeZWzZjm4qXCPCxfswJpabSWbwNrwuHh4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1KvkmkC4fVfhmun3bLjFJrqXJV9KZnsu2t"], "tags": ["galaxy", "aftereffects", "geometric", "eye", "loop", "painting", "hyperreal", "circle", "cleannfts", "art", "painter", "particle", "pencil", "drawing", "penart", "nfts", "glitchart", "eyegasm", "hen200k", "animation", "motion", "objkt", "processing", "nftartist", "colourful", ""], "extra": {}}
