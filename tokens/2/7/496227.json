The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\nIn my dream: In the midst of a large group of Hispanic men, several of whom are wearing traditional clothing and masks, I ask one man if he knows of a museum that might exhibit a collection of my work. The scene changes. An old Spaniard, dressed as a mosquito, and sporting a harpoon in his mouth, strides past. He carries a huge stockade musket, and whistles to one man, \u201cBabe, I\u2019ve got your letters.\u201d Within moments dozens of his kind arrive, and begin to clam up the sides of the mountain. The old man lobs the harpoon over the edge, but at the last moment he pulls the trigger and the letters fly into the air. This enormous event, this monumental deed, is accomplished by means of a sender who, like Loki, mimes a fatal wound, a miss, a rhetorical question.\n\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 122 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbg6HYnqDLrqotyRZBS5ZeX5GNtCQ9tyfTDKY4E6sURUN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS4gtGvb19How4hWZdZspiL3ZPp8y9ERWv7iMMgCgEjgB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbg6HYnqDLrqotyRZBS5ZeX5GNtCQ9tyfTDKY4E6sURUN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
