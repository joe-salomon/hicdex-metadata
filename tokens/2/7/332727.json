Its creation hails to the end of the first 2 items in the set to be released. Two makes the first prime, and it takes 2 to create life.\n\nI have generated 71 different randomized fractals, some are beautiful and some are frightening to behold.\n\nI will be releasing these weekly, as NFT's on different Blockchains, in sets of the greatest sequence of numbers that there is, Prime, until have released 67 onto markets.\n\nThere will be 4 NFT's that I have hidden through the web, and will be free to whoever can find them. I will be leaving clues to their whereabouts in some of my weekly posts on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/fractalmancer and on the market description pages of previous uploaded fractals.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc2G8uuWBEw17cKm4rvJqXmqRD77yjpD5vrWacKHJ8WGh", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc2G8uuWBEw17cKm4rvJqXmqRD77yjpD5vrWacKHJ8WGh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc2G8uuWBEw17cKm4rvJqXmqRD77yjpD5vrWacKHJ8WGh", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1W8fE4bx13V3TUPNQfkyN6D4iN3LUSBaF7"], "tags": ["fractals", "fractalmancer", "collection", "limited", "art", "gif", "the71", "dark", "math", "generator"], "extra": {}}
