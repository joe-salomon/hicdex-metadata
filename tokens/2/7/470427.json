I kept walking .. when I got to him , I asked him if he could give the cars and I a show as I take some photos of him for some cash; he nodded his head. Spider started counting like a conductor; took a deep breath in then gave us a show. While talking with Spider as he is smoking a cigarette after the show he was really kind to explain to me his story. Just a little over a year ago , his wife; his everything, past away at 38 due to Heart Infection which he said led to his downfall. At the end of our encounter, Spider stated that even though he is at an intersection; he enjoys playing his guitar very very much as for the company it brings him. A deep Thank you to Spider for this beautiful interaction.
