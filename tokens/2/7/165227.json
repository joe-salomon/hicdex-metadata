The beautiful tree with sunset in background was a sight to remember, However the birds are from metaverse! This is an experimental artificial photographic idea. This photo was clicked in 2018 using a Canon EOS 600D and 50mm lens. This work is my solidarity to HENXMAS theme for H=N in July & celebration of hicetnunc2000 community.
