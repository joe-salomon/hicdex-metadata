He was kind enough to give me the permission so we can call this an \"unofficial collab\" since while I was recording it he wasn't aware it was going on. ------------------------------------*RERENDER* (depth of field was added. It wasn't implemented in the plugin at the time these were made initially + VFX optical glow was also added. ---------------------------------------------- 1024x1024 | 360frames | 30FPS ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nYoutube Video Tutorial : http://bit.ly/2GTguVi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ8nk765BmbwzSVGWDue7SRqG6PfxN4UKikY9tSH4Vk4t", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ8nk765BmbwzSVGWDue7SRqG6PfxN4UKikY9tSH4Vk4t", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ8nk765BmbwzSVGWDue7SRqG6PfxN4UKikY9tSH4Vk4t", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1c9w66mt5BYvXg9PW9LHNiSZwxzYp1EtxR"], "tags": ["collab", "pattern", "rings", "hypnotic", "trapcodeTAO", "learn", "3d", "mesmerizing", "davewhyte", "beesandbombs"], "extra": {}}
