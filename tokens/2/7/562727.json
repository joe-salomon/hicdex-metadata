We published 19 issues as a digital magazine between 2007-2012. We wanted to transform the covers of these 19 issues, which we think have a historical value, into NFT and bring them to the present.\n\nWe want Maji Mag to create a series of cultural attractions that celebrate the visionary philosophy of art, philosophy and imagination. Standing in solidarity with the past, Maji Mag seeks to learn from the wisdom of traditional cultures and creates visuals that show that we are not passive spectators in a feast of archaic knowledge.\n\nEach cover will be published for 1 week. Unsold NFTs will be burned!\nBuy the covers, get the PDF!\n\nMaji Mag will also continue to share psychedelic, cyberdelic, futuristic NFTs for collectors as an artist platform. Stay tuned...\n\nThis issue's publication date is January 2008.\n\ninstagram.com/majimag\ntwitter.com/majimagart\nfacebook.com/majimagart\nmajimag.com", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdm816MYUcMmcF37H7CTpPPeyGvWHfzTabML4Tc6fAHZR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS8zgHar55iip5KdGon8rJ9rvgg9nPAzF6TZLBgQwQHtF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdm816MYUcMmcF37H7CTpPPeyGvWHfzTabML4Tc6fAHZR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bxjuJ8pd2pEgAiDabkxY1ndJYSBnQNiLh"], "tags": ["cover", "philosophy", "futuristic", "trance", "e-mag", "turkey", "psytrance", "cultural", "psyart", "cyberdelic", "mag", "maji", "mind", "visual", "psychedelic", "music"], "extra": {}}
