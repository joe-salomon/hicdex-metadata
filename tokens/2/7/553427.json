Loved the protection it gave me with this \"musician\" identity and all the wonderful opportunities I have had in my career; hated that I was kind of forced to play it as a child and painting was not encouraged in my home. I began painting in between transferring colleges and decided to just do both at any cost. Both interests inspired me but many times violin felt like a ball and chain in the ways that painting never did. Anyways.. \nFor the past 13 years I have obsessively made art and played this for a living, and many times I fantasized about abandoning one for the other. I ended up dating a longtime friend and moving to the mountains, where I took yoga seriously and all the things I repressed started to come out in huge waves of emotion. \nThis portrait combines both passions and was part of that healing process. Fast forward to today I LOVE DOING IT ALL. I even play viola and cello. I just have no life outside of my interests *happy cry face*. \nThis piece took several months to become what it is and is inspired by two decades of life experience.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcN4kpXzxdkGjuaRPXz1YViq4cfbvZsv7p7EXSuA1uVbe", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRE5xzS5KrG9LStGs57cv6odHHsQpkNxZijbUHu9G2peR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmdTm8C6i7DG8p6e7dqRUVUx7mHZDLyDJUhCbHoQGkPeT9", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcN4kpXzxdkGjuaRPXz1YViq4cfbvZsv7p7EXSuA1uVbe", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MrFSXCP13tiswYC5xD8vP14auum3NzUyo"], "tags": ["jasminfire", "violin", "acrylicpour", "spraypaint", "photography", "digitalart", "colorfulart", "realism", "narrativeart", "selfportrait", "one-of-one"], "extra": {}}
