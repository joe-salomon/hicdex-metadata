This was around the time live datamoshing was a rather new technology with many bugs and glitches (ironic in concept, but the idea of live datamoshing is having higher levels of control of how your footage is glitched.) I physically exert my failing body, knowing I won't be able to do stuff like this when my disability gets worse. And I capture beautiful footage... That glitched out and deleted itself... So I try again: same thing, only now my body is wrecked and I'm in severe levels of pain and frustration. I message the developers about the problem, and we had quite a pleasant back and forth, and today as I'm publishing this the features that we were discussing are implemented.\n   That comforts me in knowing my pain wasn't for nothing today, but on that day I was so devastated to not get any footage from the beautiful and quickly evaporating puddles outside. I took one more walk with my cane and phone, this time with a more simple goal: \"I at least need photos of how beautiful this is.\" So a third stroll we went, Lorraine & Angel to capture a moment of beauty & her to help me move my flared in pain body to get the perfect angles, with perfect Angels.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcsdfo4EZiy6jdRZNPvC7JkhFSu13ge233khHBi1dpXeU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRdgGo37YMZeGF8x4bRQ84c2JwtjYr1Qh49SpxJJzKCS2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcsdfo4EZiy6jdRZNPvC7JkhFSu13ge233khHBi1dpXeU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PqogZ7ELvjZrVaAcM2sqKKrYNgm67pSVt"], "tags": ["sewer", "rain", "rainy", "puddles", "reflection", "lightreflection", "photography", "urban", "multipleperspective", ""], "extra": {}}
