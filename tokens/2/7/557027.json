Because of habitat loss and too much catching by collectors, they have dramatically decreased in numbers.\n\nIts vertebral scutes have a rather gingko shape. It also has a gradation of pale-white to yellowish coloration line to be found near its ears.\n\nIn Philippine folklore, \"the turtle is accredited with extraordinary sagacity and cunning. It is another example of the type of tale showing the victory of the weak and cunning over the strong but stupid.\" - Mabel Cook Cole \n\nSource: https://owlcation.com/stem/The-Top-Ten-Critically-Endangered-Animals-in-the-Philippines\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThis piece is a fundraising initiative to assist the financial expenses of two Filipino surfers from Liw-liwa Zambales for the upcoming 1st Leg of Philippine Surfing Championship Tour \n\nFor personal donation and other info please check this link (https://bit.ly/3oWjTtk). \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXwyUC6Rq4ZADqXWXeQr9C6b8xccQC7DCwCFQ32nKtNLG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaXG6kTuVMiRy67YdB1AuKYMX83zyDRMuccyE4h6FPCeK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXwyUC6Rq4ZADqXWXeQr9C6b8xccQC7DCwCFQ32nKtNLG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZzWbwteKmwRiwE3YNMa2JufN4q1wEUUdh"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "psychart", "illustration", "psychedelicart", "astral", "folklore", "animalart", "tradingcards", "tarotcards", "cards", "arttarot"], "extra": {}}
