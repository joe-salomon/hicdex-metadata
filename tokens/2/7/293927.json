The full moon on a summer evening, in this case, distorted by the heat rising from a hearty crackling campfire. On the fire, popcorn bursts. With each burst, the moon dances.\n\nThis was the 2nd video in my practice which I produced using a borrowed camera. Although simple, the contemplative space it creates continues as a focus 23 years on, particularly with regards to our relationship with the natural world.\n\nIn 2021, the promise of what summer brings has changed.
