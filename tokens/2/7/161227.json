The devlog will only ever run three entries deep as to keep from clogging the NFT's description. I've recently claimed the domain nicopets.nft, .nfts are still not functional yet, but that will be the place where all nicopet info and archived devlogs will go once its up! For now, check out nicodaunt.com/nicopets for a running list of available nicopets!   ||| 7-7-2021 hic et nunc is back up! I'll be randomly dropping NicoPets to both kalamint and hic et nunc throughout the day. Still doing 3-5 pets in each litter so check out https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/NicoPets/creations as well for new pets!  ||| 7-6-2021 Welcome to the wonderful world of Nico Pets! I'm rolling out a \"soft launch\" today.  My plan is to keep users updated on the progress of Nico Pets through dev-logs minted into the Pets themselves.  As for now there will be 3-5 Nico Pets born daily, look out for new litters on kalamint.io and hicetnunc|||  DM me on Instagram or Twitter for more info @nicodaunt", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR54gRJRmjkX5yvPHzjA6jpAyUJYj6CDqBLjrVQPcUpuZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmR54gRJRmjkX5yvPHzjA6jpAyUJYj6CDqBLjrVQPcUpuZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR54gRJRmjkX5yvPHzjA6jpAyUJYj6CDqBLjrVQPcUpuZ", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1TPuUVvLeVGGCoDX4Wdvn8F6xtX8ifZ8qm"], "tags": ["nicopet", "nicopet", "nico", "pet", "animal", "collectible", "animated", "gif", "generative", "hair", "fur"], "extra": {}}
