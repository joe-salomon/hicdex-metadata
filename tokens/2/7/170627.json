Although everyone seems to prefer the sunset palette, I personally prefer the mood of this piece. Seeing how the lines holding the spinnaker were a bit curvy in #1, I played around with taught lines, and ultimately fell in love with them, giving the composition a better balance between curves and straight lines. I also rebuilt the spinnaker and ran it from low to high instead of left to right. This ended up being the final conceptual design I referenced to build the animation for \"Cruisin'\". @Slephy2 is ma twitter.
