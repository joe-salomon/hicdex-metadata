I came here to tell you how it\u2019s going to begin. I\u2019m going to hang up this phone, and then I\u2019m going to show these people what you don\u2019t want them to see. I\u2019m going to show them a world, without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.
