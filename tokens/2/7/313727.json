As you know, it didn't go particularly well. If I remember correctly, it was one of those games where it felt like the Nuckies never really had a chance. \nWe headed home on the bus, and got off at close to home. My partner and I looked down the corridor to downtown and wondered what was going on. Smoke billowed up from the streets into the hazy summer sky. \nWe were disappointed about the Canucks losing like everyone else, but couldn\u2019t do the mental gymnastics to figure out that people were rioting. Our jaws dropped when we turned on the news.\n\u2018Vancouver Summer\u2019 centres that fateful June evening as the beginning of a summer to remember. It\u2019s amazing how that big moment serves as signposts for the little ones. From losing your keys to going for a swim. From late-night dance parties to the exact shirt you were wearing on a particular day. And holding hands through the whole thing.
