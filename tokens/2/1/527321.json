I don't want to do bad-payed work for labels n companys anymore, I want to do this for me and for people who really appreciate what I do. This \"Ready to Clay\" NFT (the first I ever do) is a tribute to the old me and to Biggie Smalls and his album \"READY TO DIE\", that's how I feel everyday. Ready to die and ready to live. <3\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmbn94RNFzabvTXbSeDshC6gnRkKtHLs3YxVcXPbDExpkS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYceBfg7k69TkAC9fc6PJwhWpjWqpkx4CnygRTBsYSKqo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmbn94RNFzabvTXbSeDshC6gnRkKtHLs3YxVcXPbDExpkS", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tc2cpxZ6rQ2X8ecQN7N3TiqrjNvt1G2hU"], "tags": ["biggie", "clayart", "readytodie"], "extra": {}}
