{"__version": 1, "token_id": 552321, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "INSPECT INSECT INCEST INCEPTS", "description": "I suppose a lot of the work I do is kind of algorithm based. I create various parameters and rules based on the words that come to me. So for instance, in this particular work, the words INSPECT and INCEPTS are anagrams of each other. Now if we lose the letter P we then have the words INSECT and INCEST. We then can create a fictional and ridiculous narrative from these words which is: INSPECT INSECT INCEST INCEPTS. The meaning of this fictional narrative isn't the important aspect here; it's the words that have this incredible flexibility and resilience that are the stars that burn brightly. The form that takes shape is almost like an hourglass. The reason why it indents in is because of the loss of the letter P. It's fun to experiment with various constants. In this case the constant is the prefix \"IN\"; within all of these words, the only letters that do not move whatsoever are \"I\" and \"N\". From these particular parameters we can select only a handful of words that would fit this criteria, hence these words.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaEH6KRCSydzV1ZmtJMwbWq62Gy225e4qJcRbVxRY3d7N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWz3yYkqzDANThPAGCyimjKQ4qdK7Z7SWQdHpYUr6GYnj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaEH6KRCSydzV1ZmtJMwbWq62Gy225e4qJcRbVxRY3d7N", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
