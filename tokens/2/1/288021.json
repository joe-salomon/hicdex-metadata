Ingram in 1964. It is chambered in either .45 ACP or 9mm. A two-stage suppressor by Sionics was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abates the noise created, but makes it easier to control on full automatic (although it also makes the gun far less compact and concealable).For a decade, the semi-automatic pistol version of the weapon was forbidden in the U.S. under the assault weapons ban enacted by Congress in 1994.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiex4nrx4nhyhoyh4vfjjgdkdguzf7uhlmvwyautl5zg2ymieywbea", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeictayiybfj5blipyaaub57faulj2srhhxasasetvdek66skvrmhku", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiex4nrx4nhyhoyh4vfjjgdkdguzf7uhlmvwyautl5zg2ymieywbea", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1KkgyJhYvpdf7qSpPqMwqWgMZkREs75msN"], "tags": ["MAC10", "GUN", "NFT", "ART", "TEZOS", "HICETNUNC"], "extra": {}}
