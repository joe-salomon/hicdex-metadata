On the way we passed the famous landmark the Kerrera Lighthouse. \n\nIt had been deep fog all morning and the view of the lighthouse was disguised, just vague red lines in the mist.\n\nThis little abstract painting is evocative of the journey and the lighthouse.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmctvdP91ASTD6Y2BSZNJC57mQ1C8VK9Ywjg7ibg29bbey", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTkoUKpsawuxydN1Vad3ngJn4ibik6kKE5YLMANWr4tLk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmctvdP91ASTD6Y2BSZNJC57mQ1C8VK9Ywjg7ibg29bbey"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
