The body then finds itself both as seer and visible, that is, it admits and identifies itself around the things that make up its material framework, its existence. Then, within what is most elemental in nature, in its even minute structures, the consciousness that observes and deliberates changes the environment in which it is inserted, thus, the organism acts in the system around causing indeterminacy, and as if proportionally, the system around acts in the organism, modifying its symbolic systems. There is a deep feedback as unconsciousness; thoughts; consciousness; perceptions; memories; symbolic updates; new perceptions and future memories. We are a symbolic body in flux in a world in transit, and if there is one thing that the real does not stop doing, it is relating to us. Perhaps then, the shortest distance between what we consciously feel and what is the flow itself, whether internal or external, could be Art. Art as a reconciling vehicle between pure manifestation and the unconscious/conscious manifested. The design developed by the body then, serves the symbolic intercommunication between beings and the world.\n\nDimensions of the work: 5000 x 5000.
