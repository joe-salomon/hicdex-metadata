Yates) and my granddaughter (Felicity Echo Hanson). She is a MASTER of CHAOS, and creates wild, energetic lines. (Of course she's only two, so she doesn't REALIZE how great her art is, yet...) And then I come in and carve out a bit of definition in the chaos. My part is making the work less exciting and energetic, but also giving it more of a figurative, \"recognizable\" face (or \"hand\" in this case). I think we work well together! (And, yes, I'm putting money from sales away for her college education!!!) ---Richard F. Yates (Holy Fool) & Felicity Echo Hanson (Toddler Terror)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUhHScrhTCqfMWCXsUAQgxq1NHw3CUvTgbZVLqQCrHaWM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPpfHuvGyXBQGNXtraeeBF6LJFbbjrFHsUbSpraWD6Bke", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUhHScrhTCqfMWCXsUAQgxq1NHw3CUvTgbZVLqQCrHaWM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1iD7LwGyJMtUQ7pRB5Rb4y1jXTTBYf8PWV"], "tags": ["art", "crayonsarecool", "monsters", "horror", "weird", "nfts", "cryptoart"], "extra": {}}
