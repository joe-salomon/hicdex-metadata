I didn't know anyone at the park, but heard there was gunna be a meetup there before a ride so I went.\nInitially I was just standing by my car and watching people show up. Then a few guys started doing wheelies and I just hopped in the road.\nAfter I was passed by a couple times I heard someone yell \"yo I think that mexican guy is taking pictures!\"\nA couple guys started to really show off once they realized I was taking photos.\n\nThis was my favorite from that. I love to capture motion.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYmzy1wRUfhyzjXyL7b4hNYHVF8fq9xNrGrN7gMN2YJnc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNPiAwuLXoT5evJvu9sMWtWe8g8TXZVc3vhSt1dx6JJ4h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYmzy1wRUfhyzjXyL7b4hNYHVF8fq9xNrGrN7gMN2YJnc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dBUQHUtAbKica9w195DNvSPR5Rcn9EA8w"], "tags": ["photography", "filmphotography", "film", "analogphotography", "street", "streetphotography", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "blackandwhitephotography"], "extra": {}}
