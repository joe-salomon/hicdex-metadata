Fentanyl depresses the central nervous system and respiratory function. Exposure to fentanyl may be fatal. Fentanyl is estimated to be 80 times as potent as morphine and hundreds of times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl could possibly be used as an incapacitating agent to impair a person\u2019s ability to function. It can be absorbed into the body via inhalation, oral exposure or ingestion, or skin contact. It is not known whether fentanyl can be absorbed systemically through the eye, and can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or as a skin patch.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWhUJpJ8axjgE1trexwr6LQQKPCtJFRQf3zkFueTBfs4f", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWhUJpJ8axjgE1trexwr6LQQKPCtJFRQf3zkFueTBfs4f", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWhUJpJ8axjgE1trexwr6LQQKPCtJFRQf3zkFueTBfs4f", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "fentanyl", "nft", "collectible"], "extra": {}}
