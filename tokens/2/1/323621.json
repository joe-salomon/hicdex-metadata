He said it was no problem and also told me that he has been sleeping in the shopping area opposite Stratford station (which is where he had left his few belongings with a friend) for a few weeks. \n\nI won't share his name or his full story but I will say that it made me realise how close many people are to becoming homeless. So many people live their life paycheck to paycheck and it can just take a single stroke of bad luck, the loss of a loved one, addiction, mental health isssues etc. to a person becoming homeless very quickly.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcLZ6y7i9HjEgYSP1V1eBv4BdxYzyRP5K7g5pwKb8z8tE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS7WmBxeEgMqCJLXdkv4PcbGEPhFD6S8UdRYcbouc1XBC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcLZ6y7i9HjEgYSP1V1eBv4BdxYzyRP5K7g5pwKb8z8tE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Xd3x8mbRMpmLeRGMfuRAHNYgWDim53BQh"], "tags": ["bw", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "photo", "photography", "2d", "street", "streetphotography", "life", "people"], "extra": {}}
