Something I made when I was 15 years old as an aspiring artist and photographer, but never published. I\u2019m now 30 and am finally sharing this piece and many more I\u2019ve found from my old CD and USB drives. This is a photo of some flowers in my Nan\u2019s garden. I then edited it in Photosuite to create an inverted glitch piece, in pastel colours. I did a few in different colours and have minted a vivid purple vision on my main account objkt/96705.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXo7yi9SncbZLrcUaeNcYRCqKGAHX4FezL5bNdKeWv89K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXhLPdR4Zg5Y88aNJNZ5xCdenivR63Dkv24c3SSw5dTYd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXo7yi9SncbZLrcUaeNcYRCqKGAHX4FezL5bNdKeWv89K", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iYYUZaS5uxbrfCBEnWvAAcFTqxomTx8wW"], "tags": ["sianvictoria", "sianvictoria", "glitch", "pastel", "inverted", "art", "photography", "flowers", "hippie"], "extra": {}}
