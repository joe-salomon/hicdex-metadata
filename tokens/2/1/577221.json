After Magritte.", "description": "This animated NFT is a modern interpretation of the 1935 painting 'The Human Condition' by Belgian surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. \n\nMagritte had this to say about his painting:\n\n\"This is how we see the world. We see it outside ourselves, and at the same time we only have a representation of it in ourselves. In the same way, we sometimes situate in the past that which is happening in the present. Time and space thus loose the vulgar meaning that only daily experience takes into account. Questions such as 'What does this picture mean, what does it represent?' are possible only if one is incapable of seeing a picture in all its truth, only if one automatically understands that a very precise image does not show precisely what it is. It's like believing that the implied meaning is worth more than the overt meaning\u2026 Although this manner of knowing the 'world' may be useful in treating mental illness, it would be silly to confuse it with a mind that can be applied to any kind of thinking at all.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Magritte)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRnaMJrCqzfubB4DLLjDU7q8fRDCd2Jtwm8NHSJz7czrb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPfAcVhJr5SWRcwehJj7wSUH7rYi2CSF4b9Z8ZPpdXxq3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "video/mp4", "uri": "ipfs://QmRnaMJrCqzfubB4DLLjDU7q8fRDCd2Jtwm8NHSJz7czrb"}], "creators": ["tz1fvSHkgKSFzFPY8n74kwimUjKuKK4mcvDd"], "tags": ["magritte", "surrealism", "vintagetechnology", "motiongraphics", "digital", "retro", "vaporwave", "crt", "art", "cathoderaytube", "glitch", "loop", "beach", "collage", "retrotechnology", "technology", "animation", "tech", "tv", "retrofuturism"], "extra": {}}
