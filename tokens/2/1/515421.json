In this experimental project I try to explore discourses about images, digital culture, food myths and memories of disasters. I \"cooked\" this menu with the Montage method using pictures of fancy food from the internet that I downloaded without permission \u2013 mostly from Michellin star food \u2013 to present a metaphor about the landscape of environmental disasters caused by the oligarchic corporations in Indonesia, some disasters have not even been resolved until now , such as the Lapindo Mud tragedy, Karawang oil leak, forest fires in East Kalimantan etc., there are 10 series in this project and will continue, I try to imagine what if an image of food that has a certain personal memory and is distributed to public spaces every day has a collective memory about environmental disasters and the failure of capitalism in managing the environment. This is a series with the title \"two kids died in the blue lake\" is a food metaphor about one of the many ex-mining holes that were not closed by a mining company and then drowned two small children in Kalimantan.\nBon Appetit!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZNAJrCfSM9MMaU3FWLq2CLKf2C7ziRiXpRMZD6CAD1Se", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSqAurqFWjuf61REVJEJateiFpwLC63cJN8PAUQikzDce", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZNAJrCfSM9MMaU3FWLq2CLKf2C7ziRiXpRMZD6CAD1Se", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ga7AUM4SYd7GuhZ4bwrZ6L6X5wzaahifN"], "tags": ["food", "images", "freedownload", "expensiveNFT", "conceptual", "digital", "art", "montage", "method"], "extra": {}}
