Trying to convince the collector to create a wallet was futile, So i created a hand drawn NFT that they could attach to their laptop with wire and then flexx hard with that 1/1 ! The collector took a photo of it after loading it up on their laptop. I took a photo of their photo and swapped it on HEN ! There has to be an easier way to make an NFT.\nCreated by Nite Owl, 2021. \n1238 x 1238 pixel, 300 dpi png file.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVHZy1WE5C62ag56esTi7Z1YhFPB99nJFnGRgRR9LZW7N", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU4ciEdj9eLNXeiidnCJLrUhWcGKAXoLX6NMRffm6fhYR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVHZy1WE5C62ag56esTi7Z1YhFPB99nJFnGRgRR9LZW7N", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PABDPXbg9rqz62umCaQ8YhCUajmoYK2Cb"], "tags": ["NFT", "watercolor", "photo"], "extra": {}}
