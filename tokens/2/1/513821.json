It can be seen from the behavior patterns of various groups of people, greed often appears at every opportunity. Individuals who have found a comfortable place are often biased with an unrelenting desire to get more than what they already have.\n\nWe never fully know exactly what desire wants or why it wants it, or in what ways we ourselves may be involved. For the subject, desire is thus a constant process of questioning what one has or wants to have. The neurotic subject has a relation to desire by the way of fantasy, due to the fact that fantasy has the function of sustaining desire.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbcaqD6MEZs8MRrL3BcYWpkC9tFAVuss9wXXyxwLiNSgG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaPshEUa7gXe3FkXrzcBqn82Fsnae2gkX6Cz8ku8YPRCS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbcaqD6MEZs8MRrL3BcYWpkC9tFAVuss9wXXyxwLiNSgG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2EP2TQVaDS4YmApGpAxvZ6rGq9dVjQBg1f"], "tags": ["NFT", "NFTs", "NFTdrop", "CleanNFTs", "NFTcollection", "NFTcollectibles", "NFTcollectors", "NFTcommunity", "hicetnunc2000", "jpeg", "art", "contemporaryart", "contemporarypainting", "acrylicpainting", "painting", "canvas", "realism", "pig", "fire", "fallingup"], "extra": {}}
