Talks about the importance of looking back to know how to deal with\nthe issues we face today. As \"Sankofa\" which in the Adinkra symbol is represented by the bird that walks forward with the\nhead turned back.\n\nAfrican knowledge is transmitted through orality and, as the thinker from Piau\u00ed Antonio Bispo said: Even if they burn\nwriting will not burn orality.\n\nOur ancestors related to each other and to the planet with respect. Today\nnature gives signs that things are not going well. But even so, in African cosmology we do not work from the perspective of the end,\nthe end is not the end. Every end is a new beginning, it is circularity.\n\nClimate change is an indicator that our behavior as human beings\nand the way we treat the planet urgently needs to change. There is always the possibility of creating new beginnings.\n\n50% of the sales of these pieces will be donated to the movements that are operating in the South of Bahia after the damage caused by the rains and floods.\n\n\nWRITED AND PRODUCED BY B.ART", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaGigDdBrgGn7XTxMXZxgreHr9nYPvgrbWu2taAiTugf3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaqmtE55Vs4189CgCB3D8yNL51QJTJQrrYLYtJBPRUwze", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaGigDdBrgGn7XTxMXZxgreHr9nYPvgrbWu2taAiTugf3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1h8XhwuqQLyvBqStSGHjGMH5KVJUJ2se4q"], "tags": ["blackfutureafrofuturismsavetheplanetsankofaancestry"], "extra": {}}
