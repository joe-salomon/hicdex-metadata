No more bumpy road, easy access sign. No luck meeting residential deer, buffalo, and the peacock. Sun shining hard, even made the road look oily.

As the first-ever collection made, Danar dedicated these NFT's to mother nature as we move towards the new era of digitalization using Tezos blockchain as #CleanNFTs.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYMAVhqThEWUSqDNbHZV45j63iKKLQzuXwBhEcDZ1av67", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSpruzvhYdF3p6wV9GWkCmWuwswqngMk9RYT39GczEhWc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYMAVhqThEWUSqDNbHZV45j63iKKLQzuXwBhEcDZ1av67", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L52m92TwUPihkqTHBBCUBaTQsFGpm9VgD"], "tags": ["photography", "tree", "nature", "landscape", "savanna", "art"], "extra": {}}
