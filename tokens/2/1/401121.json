The concept of the series is to increase awareness to the disturbing status as well as the amazing migration of Monarch Butterflies. The Monarch Butterfly is one of North America\u2019s most phenomenal species. As the only butterfly known to make the transcontinental migration, Monarch Butterflies will be migrating from September to October in order to arrive at their \"wintering\" sites in November. Monarch Butterflies encounter various challenges on their annual migration\u2026 strong winds can blow them off course... rain and/or cold temperatures can slow them down... the lack of energy-producing nectar sources and parasitic diseases may lead to death as well as collisions with humans and their vehicles. It must be noted that No individual Monarch Butterfly completes the entire round-trip journey. It may take from three to five generations to complete the round-trip transcontinental migration of the phenomenal Monarch Butterfly.\n\nThis image was created with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI).
