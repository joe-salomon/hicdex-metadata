I burn myself when I reach the extreme, in those cases, I am not thinking responsibly but \u00a1How much hurt everything that we cannot change!\n\nIt frustrates what exceeds us, doesn't it?\n\nThe biggest discussion, I think, is whether we are going to keep flying to collect food or to enjoy spreading our wings, and doesn't matter where we go. Fate, bastard whoever sold it to us. May the infinite destinies rot! They have all left us behind once we have reached them.\n\nThe flight you've been on since you were born is the only one that hasn't left you. Is it possible that existence is suffering? I just want to feel that I fly.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTSevcpLsquhZpUmoJnDQthb4GRSVi7sDfwwQgdr24mgR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRqBCDQQgA6vuQrnzky13wvgg5UmvatJKGkWTxK6astUf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTSevcpLsquhZpUmoJnDQthb4GRSVi7sDfwwQgdr24mgR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1awTkiW3a2DJiaAQ3D5GTpBYPn3e8ehFGr"], "tags": ["fly", "collage", "travel", "writer", "photography", "photo", "juancolacioppo", "elviajedemisfotos"], "extra": {}}
