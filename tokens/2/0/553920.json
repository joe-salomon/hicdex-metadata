RELIVED; DENS, DUNES.", "description": "This work has the distinct dubious honor to be the only work that was banned from Instagram just for the sheer virtue I tagged it #nudes. So ridiculous, but what can you do? But I digress. Similar to the previous work we have separate lines with words. Each word has a matching anagrams in each line. Each line that connects to the word below it has a similar color structure as the previous image. If the letter doesn't move its a specific color. If the letters switch from one side of the word to the other side and that other letter is reciprocal, it's another color. What we end up with is: DELIVER; SEND NUDES. RELIVED; DENS, DUNES. The narrative is nonsensical, but look at the pattern of these lines? See a pattern? Most of the letters in these words don't move at all, it's mostly the first and last letters that reciprocate. Not many words can do this. It's all about hunting for these specific parameters that allows us to make these types of images. I find these types of anagrams to be almost magical.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQxdXNBFYLqBXy9nnqJtmEkn3qSpWdPhcCwUPuwjMELT5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP7dFv52HWPEs5zku3TsStJgZYsgNRKLjBrVzriyxuiR8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQxdXNBFYLqBXy9nnqJtmEkn3qSpWdPhcCwUPuwjMELT5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
