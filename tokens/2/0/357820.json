Melissa is always super awesome to work with and if you don't recognize her you should google the name. She has all the websites your mother warned you about;)\n\nThis is my 7th NFT. I've decided my initial offering this first two days in the NFT space will be 10 pieces that show the general feel of my work. After that I'm going to think on it a bit and probably limit my minting to a small weekly drop. As this is literally only my second day in the space, that is subject to change of course but I thought I would give at least somewhat of a roadmap of my plans. \n\nThank you to everyone who has shown me love so far. I really appreciate it and I can't wait to see where this goes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPDT6cTJnWAkbYaSwmp7Hog723eRZWR1YXo9ZfrroZouw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXPJMGNKihRNYkGX6aNTisNDV8fMgPjJBi4rQRdLzVgq6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPDT6cTJnWAkbYaSwmp7Hog723eRZWR1YXo9ZfrroZouw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["nudeart", "erotic", "model", "artnude", "nudity", "nft", "photography", "photo", "nsfw", "nude", "woman", "keithallenphillips", "sexy", "beer", "inked", "tattoo", "tattooed", "paletrashy", "sheer", "redhead", ""], "extra": {}}
