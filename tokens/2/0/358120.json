Typical of the fifties and sixties, the furnishing was clean and smooth. The art of that period was also very colorful. I started drawing with markers when I was twelve. With an artist mother, art is a part of my DNA. I did the Dansk series in 2018 and never posted it or tried to sell it. It sat on my computer until now. With the advent of NFT's, I went through my work and decided to show the series first. I've minted the series on Hicketnunc, and they will be featured in a London virtual gallery in Oct.  \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb7XRr9MXYqkwYJmcjWVBADA574zLsY9M6hjesvYUUKto", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZBuokRLeKzfYhzj9CxBSX84cRarkjWoALT8w28yRBw5r", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb7XRr9MXYqkwYJmcjWVBADA574zLsY9M6hjesvYUUKto", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VN4MDWeR8iMWgFtVMpmxpbDZ492hTYWQh"], "tags": ["Illustration", "tezos", "abstract", "modern", "fineart"], "extra": {}}
