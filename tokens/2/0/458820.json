He is a monstrous creature that looks like a large gorilla and is on the lookout for its victims who may be human beings, animals and all those who have a tongue!\n\nTo attract his victims he uses a very unique resource. It is said that he disguises himself as a leafy tree or a fallen trunk so that people can lean back and rest.\n\nJust when the tired traveler is resting, peacefully on the riverbank, he attacks him, kills him and rips out his tongue.<Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZjDfKZXf42dYpPSSrR1y6vEmRmUrEeoLacGTFwNhG385", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWF7GcjNF7ErFUB7Xg95uKnHVsB1HqtfU5TKf14eKJ5uZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZjDfKZXf42dYpPSSrR1y6vEmRmUrEeoLacGTFwNhG385", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["forest", "characters", "brazil", "legends", "cryptolegends", ""], "extra": {}}
