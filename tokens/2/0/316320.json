Occasionally, it tries to fly through, only to hit the glass and fall onto the windowsill. It struggles to get back onto the window, and then repeats the process. I realize the fly doesn't recognize there's a window blocking it from going outside, but every time it falls, it takes longer for it to get back up. It's dying, unable to free itself of its delusion. It doesn't see there's an open door right next to it that leads outside. Another fly buzzes around the window fly before swiftly exiting through the door, as if showing the way. Yet, the window fly stays stuck to that illusion where its eyes are free but its body is not. It will die there unless it realizes there's an open door right beside it. \n\nIf you think about it, that's a great life lesson to learn.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeTrzsnYM4u683j8QpNuASjVjAnQpba5P45LKui5HnUyn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWuiupSfdbrhyaQD3tGUveYTV8sLZDqrpEpKHFCKhqctV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeTrzsnYM4u683j8QpNuASjVjAnQpba5P45LKui5HnUyn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rn339EyYkX4ygVtZ61XpLTBe5hikvFUa7"], "tags": ["series", "visiblethoughts", "trending", "nft", "writing", "journal", "artjournal", "artwork", "scrapbook", "story", "visualart", "digitalart", "cryptowriting"], "extra": {}}
