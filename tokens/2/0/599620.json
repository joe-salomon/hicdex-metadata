When you see something like this, you get tired of the prevailing politics. Also take a look at my paintings \"Tired\", \"More Tired\" and \"Very Tired\". \n\nThis work is based on a photograph I found on the floor of a train car some time ago. I couldn't just leave it there because someone else might walk over it. So I picked it up, wrote \"found on train, 12/16/08\" on the back and pinned it to the wall in the kitchen.\n\nThis work has now been produced to remind us of the humanitarian disasters in the Mediterranean Sea and the English Channel. Despite the many deaths that there are always to mourn, the policy fails to this day. I made five different versions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYBNVXVVVeA3SXb9YMRqLdofnZ8rXZDyo55jkfut5r2od", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbDxag71KtxCqhX8JHvYkrWWThToZQMsbJMrRZDs1tYmt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYBNVXVVVeA3SXb9YMRqLdofnZ8rXZDyo55jkfut5r2od", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hWtnNnDHFvkvqfQEV4VXLJXr4GqC5qACp"], "tags": ["Tired", "Moretired", "Verytired", "Foundling", "protestart", "fineart", "contemporaryart"], "extra": {}}
