Migaloo senses the danger and gets out of the way.\n\nI am an artist who lives on the English coast. But, when I lived on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia, I would walk my dog on the beach most days after lunch. I saw so many whales in 2013 year, I thought it was about time I painted them.\n\nWhile doing my research online about humpback whales I came across something really inspiring.\n\nOn 28th June 1991, an all-white whale was photographed passing Byron Bay, Australia's most easterly point. Named Migaloo by the indigenous community in Queensland (\"White Fella\"), at the time the whale was the only documented all-white humpback whale in the world.\n\nFor me Migaloo is symbolic of the vulnerability of the humpback population. This series of paintings focused on Migaloo, tells the story of his journey up and down the coast. \n\nSince 2013 Migaloo, whales and other crustacea have become a symbol in my work for all living creatures and the fragility of the environment.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVbq528nNwso9mZ9MYBgqkvd7BZesTxKtjAQ5fivKLvfJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNLjHKodbVJDqvHZsYKg8rX5Jf2aikzovLVrxbSy14Ygd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVbq528nNwso9mZ9MYBgqkvd7BZesTxKtjAQ5fivKLvfJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ioRLsn8E8XhvmroEVaKg7LGtxFt7bn9Wq"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
