The ONG selected is called Alimenta la Solidaridad Petare \u2764\ufe0f \u2028Make sure to donate if you can via their Gofundme page. \u2028\u2028\n\nThank you so much #NFTcommunity and specially thank you Kideight for the opportunity to participate on this great event!\u2028\n\nI hope you all enjoy the piece as much as we did while creating it!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWBgMsJNRKKZHnVmpEUvHmNLHfYgY75hJQwJoERhHkVeo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYcTqNWsUVTcPMuMPmrS5s9GCw9UNVm6BnuU4Ap6Yjbn2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWBgMsJNRKKZHnVmpEUvHmNLHfYgY75hJQwJoERhHkVeo", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QbnYfE8jJbVk6GjEKLHvJ94pDxVNvAWp1"], "tags": ["KidEight", "EvolArtComp", "Petare", "Caracas", "Venezuela", "NFT", "Cyberpunk", "animation", "Cherub", "EVOL", "Devol", "Gevol", "collab"], "extra": {}}
