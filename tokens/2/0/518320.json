The reproduction is a beautiful object of the early twentieth century and is therefore in fact an antique find in itself. A find that represents an older find, which in turn represents the timeless icon of classic femininity. The head was scanned with a photogrammetry device, then processed in a 3D environment and remapped with new imaginative, lush, and colorful textures, all deriving from my original freehand or digital drawings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdzrk8XLcT2guDyRP7AGWPaatbRURGG3Jy4UaJvk2vu3a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQafsFnPpR5X41p5ezgmUp24uiwuLsUm8crLCFaZuNmF4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdzrk8XLcT2guDyRP7AGWPaatbRURGG3Jy4UaJvk2vu3a", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1amsgMaX2kYNLHMttB26Rf1EXmy5eJAwZG"], "tags": ["3D", "3Dsculpture", "3Dmodeling", "virtualsculpture", "America", "3Dscan", "turntable3d", "3Dobject"], "extra": {}}
