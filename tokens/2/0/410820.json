The two members would have been Jean-Claude Van Damme (Belgian born martial-art film star) and Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon (1 half of Christo & Jeanne-Claude: artists noted for their large-scale, site-specific environmental installations, often large landmarks and landscape elements wrapped in fabric, including the Wrapped Reichstag). The duo would have sung duet covers such as: (I've) Had The Time of My Life, Easy Lover, Reunited, You've Got a Friend, and who could forget their incredible cover of Islands in the Stream. Oh and they would only sing songs from a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am that was wrapped in boxing glove gauze cloth. What? You don't remember this epic duo? Where have you been?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeBdXTwr2mqEtFjPegQQ8MatxXtQmAwWra9sSMCcHZ1FN", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNjuwvyoCPdCawtPUKK2UtSqcDNTHnBWu911gSMBjiwrV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeBdXTwr2mqEtFjPegQQ8MatxXtQmAwWra9sSMCcHZ1FN", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
