This can be seen in most digital 3d systems when geometry is modelled or moved very far away from the origin of the 3d scene. This is otherwise known as the Far From Origin problem.\n\nThe cliffs of dover were chosen because of their extreme verticality and rocky details, which when combined with the far from origin errors, form a generative system exposing details in the topography. Audio was recorded September 2021 in the North of Spain on the shores of the Cantabrian Sea. The audio and 3d model undergo similar manipulations. As they move farther from their origin, they can no longer be represented as continuous elements of shape and sound. The digital formats designed to represent them are limited and ultimately, human.\n\n3840 x 2160 (4k, 16:9), 30 fps, 1200 frames, 00:00:40, mp4, aac audio 44100 Hz stereo, 95.3 mb\n\n\u00a9 2021 Luis E.
