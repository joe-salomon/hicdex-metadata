This is my genesis drop ! A 134 minute narrated story telling documentary of my decades living as a starving artist. The challenges, the wins, the fails, the dramas.\n  As well as being a guitar player, band leader, recording engineer, music producer and a live sound mixer I also have always been heavily involved in the creating of the art works for the bands I have played in including making music videos \u2013 directing, scripting, story boarding, shooting, editing etc.\n  The avant-garde and experimental environment created by the early NFT purveyors feels homey to me. My peeps !! I'm so glad I found you. \n  I've got plans. Keep an eye on me !!!\n  Enjoy, Kurt\n\n0:12      #1 - Being Indie\n6:15      #2 \u2013 Landing In London\n20:52     #3 \u2013 The Biggest Thing\n32:58     #4 \u2013 The Biggest Thing pt.2\n46:10     #5 \u2013 The Mr. Martin's\n52:12     #6 \u2013 Living From Live\n1:06:23   #7 \u2013 West Coast Misstep\n1:16:55   #8 \u2013 NYC Is For Dreams\n1:30:51   #9 \u2013 NYC Is For Second Chances\n1:45:43  #10 \u2013 NYC Is For Survivors\n1:51:59  #11 \u2013 NYC Is For Memories\n1:59:31  #12 \u2013 No Fun Zone", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQwG2fMmk6s5GoNixn2yw7uzuuE5VhQcXvYasjPHxBH75", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXzh8g7YDgNixaYbxkZ7gpNuEx83sHF2Cc5yDe83ccE53", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQwG2fMmk6s5GoNixn2yw7uzuuE5VhQcXvYasjPHxBH75", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fSpc3ZL5Cj85dtn3nxE2drRm1Tqth311a"], "tags": ["documentary", "story", "music", "musician", "producer", "artpunk"], "extra": {}}
