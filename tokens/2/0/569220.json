When the All-Star game was announced I knew there would be a good chance that an All-Star pack would emerge, and I decided to wait until then to create this artwork. Why the All-Star pack in particular? To me it has a double meaning, first celebrating the incredibly talented players in the game that came together in this very special weekend, but I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to celebrate the Top Shot team for leading the way for the collectibles industry. Very few times in our lifetime we are able to observe when a disruptive idea, vision, partnership orchestration and execution come together so swiftly to disrupt and industry and set the stage for how things will be done moving forward. I think this exactly what we are just witnessing, and I am excited to be part of it as a collector. Hope the new owner of this skull enjoys it as much as I enjoyed making it. 3500 x 3500 pixels.
