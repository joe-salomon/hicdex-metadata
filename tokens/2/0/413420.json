To the moment where nothing existed except one single point.\nComprehension of this matter will be difficult because our world wasn\u2019t always threedimensional. As a matter of fact in the beginning there wasnt any dimension at all.\nSo, at the beginning there was a point. According to Euclid point is \u201esomething that which has no part\u201d. Truthfully we dont know what it was or how the first dimension started, our very existence in many dimensions prevents us from understanding.\nBut as far as I know my friend, your scientists also disagree about how your world began. Therefore - to facilitate our communication - I decided to present the whole story using two dimensions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWs7cyvYk1gifU9YfN6iH12tDKn1AUyQUXbMd5se3wzEw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPkui3WcmNmHka4uHVtfypSVDBCrXEqpW5wZcAeZRkan2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWs7cyvYk1gifU9YfN6iH12tDKn1AUyQUXbMd5se3wzEw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QvQiJY21xcfmPGZD7qqTGsJJEW3geuwt6"], "tags": ["monochrome", "geometry", "Bezmiar", "chapter", "dimension", "grayscale", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
