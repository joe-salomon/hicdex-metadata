Aside from that, he surely enjoyed the biggest sandy toilet in Planet Wau-Wau. Suddenly, a storm swiped the entire seashore, we were lucky cause Purple the turtle invited us to his fancy igloo. As the storm vanished, I saw people falling from the sky like raindrops. There might be a rainbow if only we waited for a moment, but we were in a hurry back home to see our favorite cartoon on Petflix. We can't wait for the next Wednesday to go back there as we already made a promise with Purple the turtle to have a spaghetti feast at his fancy igloo.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmb6FY264ok9dzx32uUmxctKyjEbnKawJjf48pHL9gMjf3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb6FY264ok9dzx32uUmxctKyjEbnKawJjf48pHL9gMjf3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmb6FY264ok9dzx32uUmxctKyjEbnKawJjf48pHL9gMjf3", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2HpgpGoZtP58xrE1ZjFHFUjqrodJHzezaa"], "tags": ["illustration", "digital", "gif", "hicetnunc", "NFTs", "firstdrop", "NFTCommunity", "NFTCollector"], "extra": {}}
