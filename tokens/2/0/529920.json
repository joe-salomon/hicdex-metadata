{"__version": 1, "token_id": 529920, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Icarus", "description": "In the Icarus myth, the sun may symbolize the laws of nature, or spiritual principles, or the ways of the world. If a man flies in the face of these, he can expect to catch a lot of heat. Power without limits or conscience becomes abusive or destructive. When a young man knows no power greater than himself, he becomes grandiose and omnipotent. He installs himself as God in his own life. Without limits and containment, he cannot truly connect with himself or with others, and he becomes preoccupied with the search for limits (much as all superheroes have a critical and destructive flaw). If men are not given limits when learning about power, they internalize shame as a way of putting a cap their thoughts of omnipotent power.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQhaJwJhNAwuyu5trogCZ8jm25xAr9YMKfE9sJoGDRU6u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSFFJLDg3CP33HbNM5jwjYTs7v2745pHMsEAAxxvvtVDL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmQhaJwJhNAwuyu5trogCZ8jm25xAr9YMKfE9sJoGDRU6u"}], "creators": ["tz1ProFPUKvAh9KiumrdYv3rPnYv8JsXRU5q"], "tags": ["Icarus", "LilBztrd", "2D", "PrimitiveArt", "Illustration", "DigitalPainting"], "extra": {}}
