{"__version": 1, "token_id": 369020, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "AD 1.3 \u2014 Mother", "description": "A metal bird puts us down on a platform in the depths of the city. Thick mist covers tops of skyscrapers. People live high in the sky. I live above them all.\n\nI remember how the mother took a group of us in the Chinese district of San Francisco. A chain of orphans in pairs, a dark melting shadow, our mother, at the head of the column. It can\u2019t take a form of a living creature because of drizzle. It\u2019s cold and I\u2019m gazing into the dark, where needles of skyscrapers are hidden. Old conservative buildings of Hilton and Masatoshi are made of dark glass and steel, their huge logotypes are blurry spots, somewhere in the invisible sky. New players like Celestial and Stash Box have accepted technological advancements, their logos sit on drones and fly up and down, correlating with a level of visibility.\n\nThe mother is calling me by name. She\u2019s melting, blinking, approaching me. Its face and a hand with long fingers are almost visible.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave your pair, my little son,\u201d it\u2019s saying. \u201cC\u2019mon, honey, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m taking its hand and allowing it to bring me to a place. My sister Bell\u2019s smiling. She is of my age and wearing a pink bomber jacket and a skirt. Soles of her sneakers are gleaming with green electric.\n\nWe all are taking a turn under conscious eyes of policemen \u2014 half-humans, half-beasts. They are wearing dark masks with dog faces. Their eyes are beaming, scanning our group. The mother nods them, sending qubits of invisible information.\n\nWe are on a side street, all hiding under a canopy. Raindrops are sliding down from our black plastic covers. A Chinese man\u2019s approaching us and beckoning, inviting inside of his manufacture. Each of us receives a fortune cookie upon entering the concrete box. I\u2019m hiding mine in the right pocket. We are walking through a narrow corridor, and the Chinese is showing us ancient cookers. I see an old man taking a bowl of stripes of paper from electric hands of a blind woman. He\u2019s talking, the woman\u2019s receiving the messages from the entity that is living parsecs away on a planet of love. He\u2019s talking, each message is designated for a chosen one, and it\u2019s unavoidable. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the wrong message,\u201d he adds. \u201cGrace is dedicated for you only.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m stealing a few of the messages and put them in my left pocket. I see how my sister\u2019s crushing a biscuit with her teeth, crumbs are showering into her palm. She\u2019s taking a paper out of her mouth, smiling at me. We are both laughing. The mother multiplies around us, all her hands are enfolding us, everyone of us, and she\u2019s laughing with all of us.\n\nOrganic death is inevitable.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQNRWXZVFdiGW8CqTd1N8oYmd1h6gDm5qCYYwWhMDHsjC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQNRWXZVFdiGW8CqTd1N8oYmd1h6gDm5qCYYwWhMDHsjC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQNRWXZVFdiGW8CqTd1N8oYmd1h6gDm5qCYYwWhMDHsjC", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1boBFSnCFKEZ4HynCdmDiiNJAvJj5iH7e5"], "tags": ["cryptoliterature", "literature", "fiction", "scifi", "abstract", "transhumanism", "bayfragile", "anemonesdiaries"], "extra": {}}
