This code shows the data of inherited sexuality between devices (in this case from the parents to their daughter), and the exchange of data that arises with the first affective sexual contact with another device. Here an analogy is made between humans and machines, between the analogue and the digital media, and the intention is to show, through the code of each of the subjects, the bodily repression in education and the attempt to emancipate the female body.
