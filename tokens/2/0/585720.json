The stream of images and the radio playlist are presented in a completely random order, resulting in a constantly flickering series of discovery.\n\nTo create this installation, Overholt uses appropriated video and music in conjunction with custom software, which edits our visual and audible experiences with a randomized music playlist. Watch clips from the exhibition on YouTube or in the players below.\n\nIn One Ear \u2026 is playing at the Showroom, 1146 N. Broadway, four repurposed shipping containers that form a home base as Oklahoma Contemporary plans an arts campus for the site. The space houses exhibitions, events and an art library.\n\nDuring prime time (7-11 p.m.), the video is projected onto the gallery\u2019s windows, presenting an alternative version of the family living room. Throughout the day, the same video and audio are visible inside the Showroom and, with the additional component of a webcam, viewers are able to temporarily insert themselves into the amalgamation of media. Showroom hours are listed below.\n\nIn One Ear \u2026 is supported in part by an award from Mid-America Arts Alliance, the National Endowment for the Arts, Oklahoma Arts Council and foundations, corporations and individuals throughout Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nA new media artist currently teaching Interactive Arts at the Kansas City Art Institute, Overholt uses found, purchased, gifted and stolen materials (both physical and virtual) to create installations, sculptures, videos and other engaging experiences. He received his bachelor of art in graphic design from Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego and his master\u2019s degree from New York University\u2019s Interactive Telecommunications Program in the Tisch School of the Arts. He has exhibited nationally and is primarily interested in the stretching of boundaries between art and technology.\n\nCurated by Romy Owens.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNWSXDr4fLCe4fxkcSVfJJaU3FqtZpAbwh8e1joskGoND", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYJyGDbntEWPwi84FRtirjwYznt6jt8bADMvYjYa69qCb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNWSXDr4fLCe4fxkcSVfJJaU3FqtZpAbwh8e1joskGoND", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1TyDzhNe4gEYAQjvvAvtKNcCAkuneXFLJL"], "tags": ["generative", "archives", "nea", "failoften", "remix", "2016", "resolume", "processing", "exhibition", "fairuse", "video", "art", "mashup"], "extra": {}}
