{"__version": 1, "token_id": 327020, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MUSEUM OF ART / MUSEUM O' FART", "description": "One of most important things that is needed in a great work of art is authenticity. For so many people who aren't art scholars some art seems inconceivable, obtuse or even ridiculous. Let's face it, we humans are really good at making stuff up. There are certain moments in art history when someone did something that created a huge uproar of discontent either within the art world itself or in the general public. With one slight movement of a letter and the adding of an apostrophe, we have two completely different phrases and connotations. One is a factual statement giving information about a type of museum. The other is mocking the first by reducing all of that art in the museum to human flatulence; one of the most basic aspects of being alive. It's funny because when you really think about it, all art is made up. So much of my work pulls from so many sources. You can see Christopher Wool, Jenny Holzer, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Bruce Nauman, Richard Prince, Barbara Kruger, and so many more. As we go along in these images, I will give a brief explanation of each piece and some commentary of the influence, memory, feeling, vibe or thought on it. The structure of these images are like a stream of consciousness.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQtdNjRdAvBfPQi4k6pieSxK7VTx7ySLARFRXTWLk7rNh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSpsE5Gks3h2f3G1HDLA2d559gsiUp1t9dNAq4wj7cgNM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQtdNjRdAvBfPQi4k6pieSxK7VTx7ySLARFRXTWLk7rNh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
