{"__version": 1, "token_id": 380720, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Her Hand On His Wrist", "description": "\n\nA section of a larger painting I made, but by far the most important aspect of the composition, a woman's hand delicately wrapped around the wrist of a man. This piece is a portrayal of a woman's strength and how it can be expressed in her tenderness and wisdom. Most of the attention goes to her hand since this is where most of the detail is, allowing the viewer to meditate on this area. Perhaps in the beginning her grip seems stronger, more firm, but as the viewer becomes more relaxed, so does their perception of reality and her hand mystically becomes more gentle. \n\nTo see the full painting please do contact me via twitter @abijoysamuelart", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUPL3JW3gKeZ8tCYhSuYBgeLCh7Pf7ZPpJFr5D5pkSe5b", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUoYKYLUvfik9KGUaz7VLexVLzwXoceu6uXKvqViyYmNB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUPL3JW3gKeZ8tCYhSuYBgeLCh7Pf7ZPpJFr5D5pkSe5b", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fu6cBbp7oXDzvnP7o3pvwFkqETf2NhpVS"], "tags": ["Classicalart", "NFT", "Oilpainting", "oils", "wrist", "hand", "detail", "museum", "museumart"], "extra": {}}
