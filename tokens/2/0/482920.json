{"__version": 1, "token_id": 482920, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Judge Me Not", "description": "Ray why are your lips bug, why do you have girl legs, why do you smell like a French whore, are you gay? Why do you tweeze your eyebrows, stop looking at yourself in the mirror you fag. Why such defined Cheekbones, \u201cWhat are you? You look black, Indian and Mexican\u201d. You have some DSL Ray. All of the words I\u2019ve endured growing up in such a closed minded society of hate and bigotry. Judge Me Not reflects that story I endured. The pain and struggle of being bullied, factoring if suicide would be painless, if suicide was the freedom I needed in order to discover myself. The other side couldn\u2019t be any worse. But in the light of a Greater power. I found myself, spread my wings and flew away to my own reality of comfort and strength. I found peace in Art and community. \n\nA Cubist, Expressionism, Minimalist piece from the series \u201cWhen the West meets Goya\u201d. When I say Goya I mean the Puerto Rican product. When I say West I mean White American Culture. \n\nI hope you enjoyed this work. Painted on Canvas, digitally uploaded and enhanced.  Much Love Ray.
