Under the training of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin became more in tune with the Force, and rose among the Jedi ranks. But as he grew older, he only felt more and more imperfect. With the tipping point being a dream about his wife dying at birth, Anakin turned to the dark side of the Force to fix himself, which resulted in him falling into lava during a battle against Obi-Wan. Even though he was severely damaged, the Emperor rescued him and supported him with new armor, turning him into Darth Vader. Years later, after discovering his son, Vader had a change of heart, and sacrificed himself to save him from the Emperor and the Dark Side. After life, Anakin would spend his afterlife as a spirit of the Force, guiding the next generations of Skywalkers to come.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeibyjrenynb7c5amaiizywpurwkvkvcj2fc7beguagnntrvoungc74", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreidabcficymmmcktb24lpcyovegbsw4tqbui22ncwzso5ubgtttqbq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeibyjrenynb7c5amaiizywpurwkvkvcj2fc7beguagnntrvoungc74", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bmLb73rrMnZs92uBsTeakZmkXZWMeWRg3"], "tags": ["starwarsvaderdarthvaderartdigitalfantasy"], "extra": {}}
