{"__version": 1, "token_id": 392523, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Device #4 // CotyBox LogicSystem", "description": "The fourth of my Device series. This device is loaded with LogicSystem, a logic gate toy. The simulator is running on the device's minimal 182x128 display, while the second 128x64 display is used for selecting signal sources, logic nodes, and output nodes. \n\nNOTE: If you OWN a token for this OBJKT, you will have access to more nodes in the game! This is an experimental feature, relying on an external API. \n\nControls: \n - Left click / 1 finger touch to place nodes. Use the bottom display to scroll and select nodes. \n - Left click / 1 finger touch io spots on the nodes to start connecting wires. Wires must start at an output and can only go into an input. Only one wire between any two io, and each io can only connect to a single wire. However, io nodes can also touch and send signals to each other directly. \n - When the camera is unlocked, you can Right click / 2 finger touch to rotate the device. \n - When the camera is unlocked, scroll to move the device forward and backwards. \n - Press the switch on the top right of the device to reset the device. \n\nNotes: \n - May take a few seconds for the performance to improve and stabilize on mobile devices. Your browser will optimize the runtime during these first few seconds and hopefully reach full speed (60fps or higher).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTcgNR6GYGaNpMNLBKbFC4dkNfRyH5b59D3zDQrd2s6v6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTQkR3JwGKdfAgPmuqJXk6p4vJ4kmmWcx9DBwqX6eW4rJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTcgNR6GYGaNpMNLBKbFC4dkNfRyH5b59D3zDQrd2s6v6", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1iyGceo7J4UKJFEEjB3bRrasE8mZVETjWa"], "tags": ["interactive", "html5", "unity", "unity3d", "webgl", "webassembly", "wasm", "algorithmic", "generative", "fun", "realtime", "asm", "fast", "experimental", "toy", "device"], "extra": {}}
