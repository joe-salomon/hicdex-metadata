The loroblonyo statue itself is considered a symbol of prosperity or fertility and offspring that will continue to be sustainable, because the bride and groom include Dewi Sri (the goddess of fertility) who is met with Lord Vishnu.\n\nThe harmony depicted in this statue is expected to bring a positive aura to the owner of the house who displays it. From here, I want to describe Loroblonyo with humor, which is actually a little silly at first, why not? Because I painted this guy's thumb in the middle of his fingers as a symbol of sexual invitationm but because many people are bothered by this, I finally changed the position of the thumb, hoping that it would carry a good meaning.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRfdyCQJKVdRZq1uUVPYSd4hSrc8vWc4B4wrBti5RyHgB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQJbdDq5pQer5t88c1WqTivSqErn9Rt9N5GvvXAghyZn3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmbRM7hr2xjWZd9EWWGKvQ8Wk4vWwZJMwKHVL2i3cqFPme", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRfdyCQJKVdRZq1uUVPYSd4hSrc8vWc4B4wrBti5RyHgB", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ah3rWUJ1E4q1An3o2XWPVyyNhtEAbieKL"], "tags": ["fineart", "painting", "acryliconcanvas", "acrylic", "woman", "lover"], "extra": {}}
