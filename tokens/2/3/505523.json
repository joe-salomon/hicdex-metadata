{"__version": 1, "token_id": 505523, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sabda Raja Dosa Classick Bootleg Tape, King\u2019s Edition ", "description": "Bootleg tapes were a staple of 70\u2019s -80\u2019s Indonesian music history. Back then, western music albums weren\u2019t officially licensed locally. So the only way you could listen to foreign albums were either by getting it straight from abroad (which is expensive), or buy the \u201cofficial\u201d bootleg version that was available at your friendly local cassette stores. Naturally, most people opted for the second option. My father had a HUGE collection of these bootleg tapes. Although I found out later that bootlegging is illegal, those tapes had a major influence on my musical experience. They introduced me to some of the classic albums that I love to this day. \n\n\u201cSabda Raja Dosa\u201d was the very first song I ever released. It was originally a part of Grimloc Records and Def Bloc Union joint compilation CD \u201cPre-Text For A Bumrush\u201d, and was later put out as a standalone single on my (now practically defunct) Soundcloud page.  \n\nThis is \u201cSabda Raja Dosa\u201d as if it was release by King's.\n\nKing\u2019s practically put out everything. They\u2019re the type of label that catered to the masses, though they mostly put out older type of music. One thing about them is their sleeve designs are, almost, always colorful, even when they didn\u2019t seem to have any reason to make it colorful. I guess their designers are just obsessed with throwing disco type graphic into every single job he/she get. They did release a lot of those, along with a bunch of oldies top 40s stuffs.
