{"__version": 1, "token_id": 476623, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Jean-Michel Basquiat", "description": "Jean-Michel Basquiat (December 22, 1960 \u2013 August 12, 1988) was an American artist. He debuted as a graffiti artist in New York City in the 1970s and developed into an expressionist and neo-primitive painter. Throughout his career, Basquiat has focused on \"suggestive dichotomies,\" such as wealth versus poverty, integration against segregation, and inner versus outer experiences. Basquiat's work utilized is a synergy of appropriation, imagery, poetry, and painting, mated with text and images, abstraction and figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary criticism. Using social commentary as a \"stepping stone to deeper truths about the individual\", Basquiat's paintings sometimes attack power structures and systems of racism. While his poetry is acutely striking in the political realm and direct in their critique of colonialism and expressions of support for the struggle of the lower classes.[1][2][3]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP8BaD7y2EkqNayDWz8ZH1654u9TKZ43umU6YLzv38N6Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQhrHvsN7W4Ex9WjkE1kLisYeADAL54jxd1AZCaRqEcAV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP8BaD7y2EkqNayDWz8ZH1654u9TKZ43umU6YLzv38N6Z", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Wq3y931pnt6zsBq6XHy7eqzLM3WTsKA3D"], "tags": ["jean", "basquiat", "artist", "fenomenalizm", "sureal", "neolotic", "primitife", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
