It is a work with a lot of feeling and several messages hidden among so much shit.\nThis drawing came to me at 4 in the morning waiting for the bus to go to my city, I was very drunk getting cold with my girlfriend (the girl on the poster) and we saw the bums sleeping in the street, in their '' castle of cardboard''. It is dedicated to homeless people, my friends, my artist brothers, always holding on.\nDrawing completed on October 8, 2021.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTJnGABiYRjxRYVLn4hvz7XFFQKstv4DAocBYhZTHo7Zo", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZfL3zzvY1KCFadQoy2hoQuykTP5c5sH4HuBwg6H6iVs3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTJnGABiYRjxRYVLn4hvz7XFFQKstv4DAocBYhZTHo7Zo", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MdUgJNwoVUDjaK6nx67b1mMxsjcRGaZU1"], "tags": ["Matiaslaplata"], "extra": {}}
