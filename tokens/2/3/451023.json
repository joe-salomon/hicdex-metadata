He recognizes and provides rewards beyond measure for the any good, however small. He is the The One who leads mankind to justice and harmony.\n\nAllah witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge \u2013 [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. (Quran 3:18)\n\nSay, \u2018My Lord commands righteousness. Direct your worship straight to Him wherever you pray; call on Him; devote your religion entirely to Him. Just as He first created you, so you will come back [to life] again.\u2019 (Quran 7:29)\n\nMake a practice to stand for justice and do things righteously. You will accountable in front of Allah, and he will surely be pleased:\n\n\u201cO you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is worthier of both. So, follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted.\u201d (Quran 4:135)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSpTJ21JKwfC4CLHAstvngR9FZizEHzckBsrhoUnBhGwy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYpVwmhMggGS56hufnftmYtnzoj1FHvxjMxnnEAMcGdxS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSpTJ21JKwfC4CLHAstvngR9FZizEHzckBsrhoUnBhGwy", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XKKqyhN7ka8Svg7DBe67hrSWVNcYnrFPM"], "tags": ["asmaulhusna", "1of1", "moslem", "allah", "colorful", "asmaulhusnanft", "name", "islam", "religion", "god"], "extra": {}}
