{"__version": 1, "token_id": 504423, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "THE COSMIC CURTAIN", "description": "There are moments randomly in my daily life where I am sometimes momentarily paused in whatever I am doing and echoes of past events or visions of future potential materialise and merge with whatever I am creating (directly or indirectly) in the moment. That mammoth tool of the unconscious mind is adept at reaching way beyond the confines of the intimate now reality I am in and if I am lucky delivers a healthy portion of inspiration or sometimes delivers a teaser trailer of what could be as it draws the cosmic curtain to one side. I know this when one spoken word snaps my psyche into focus or a single simple image gives me a sense of infinite depth. Powerful stuff! You can fast track the opening of the cosmic curtain with say psychedelics but these days I am more inclined to walk in nature and as much as possible walk barefoot. The older I get the more spiritually, physically and mentally naked I am more inclined to be. Equally the easier it gets to find the opening in the cosmic curtain.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWPxsiU7bjRAxYK6Vf8ciX7rMz7pefQJVq2B8NqZSN81H", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV3YEfgGv3wrgYWNvhxHsYr4Z44eDV4HmwkEueLMZCXXo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWPxsiU7bjRAxYK6Vf8ciX7rMz7pefQJVq2B8NqZSN81H", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VQQab8jZvSDdjTn3hpdc6tPsBYPQXGQbi"], "tags": ["Marccraig", "art", "digitalart", "Londonart", "NFT", "HICETNUNC", "doodle", "unconscious", "mind", "inspiration", "esoteric"], "extra": {}}
