{"__version": 1, "token_id": 419123, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Infect The Grid - Shape 131K/2K #1", "description": "Biomorphic unique NFT computing live in your browser. It consists in 132K particles simulating physarum-mold transport and fired by 24 jets of particles.\nWhen intersections accumulate too many particles, it starts \"infecting\" the field until it reaches a stable surface with constant evolution.\n\nThis is a real microbiome evolving forever. All evolutions might be slighly different due to data<->GPU timing. You can restart it and also start/stop evolution (left click) to make snapshots.\n\nThis NFT is totally autonomous of NFT platform and IPFS. For owners, I can deliver a certificate and an independent package that you can save and re-launch out of platform forever.\n\nWARNINGS:\n- Reload if not loading, IPFS can time-out.\n- Best on computer with GPU. Don't hesitate to see it in bigger window up to 2K screen.\n- On mobile, it's a video preview as it renders badly due to float precision issues in current WebGL implementation.\n\nThis NFT is unique and is dropped in \"Shape\" collection based on the same principles but with very different renderings. Keep up for next tokens.\n\nMore information on Readme https://github.com/naibdian/naibdian-collections/tree/main/physarum/shape\n\nYou can contact on Twitter @naibdian", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRJAZxFQANynC6FxnqxjToKv3xNmiuJyX3rExTuceShjn", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmanazpjj4Kbuy38ryqE79EkwaYXrQm5RKtpEL2Gu2CECR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRJAZxFQANynC6FxnqxjToKv3xNmiuJyX3rExTuceShjn", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1PYADtd4JhgC1MmWYq7LHevu63bHwbWXg1"], "tags": ["biomorphic", "physarum", "live", "javascript", "particles", "webgl", "threejs", "generator", "animated", "genart", "generativeart", "artgen"], "extra": {}}
