Each primary sale purchase includes a physical signed version of the magazine including shipping if you want it, contact me via DM. (for secondary sales the magazine can also be negotiated.)\nIt is a document of origins and early experiments. The Secure Shell\tCopy Series captures the complexity of our evolution towards increased digital existence.\nOur biological bodies will adapt over time to deal with the constant electromagnetic pulses, carrying slivers of who we are and what statistics suggest we should be. The works begin as a digital scan of the body, taken at a specific moment in time and representative of an infinitely thin surface. Various algorithms reduce the information to the point where the figure is barely recognizable. The shell is then infused\twith data, expanding and contracting as it tries to accommodate\tthe flux of information, ever shifting like sand in the desert. \nThe later part of the magazine contains screenshots of the Blender interface and process samples.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmefE5W2JZ9mri4qMazND5LugPjxYsKd4KgyZoESXFbtMB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUubEe6riCbvQTUTTPHCJG8Ez9JTSAkHw1xGFnsfM7GMr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmefE5W2JZ9mri4qMazND5LugPjxYsKd4KgyZoESXFbtMB", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz1hhG3vN2NCoPZepvEbKHBFQ5denwNJwHXP"], "tags": ["Magazine", "3dscan", "portraits", "blender"], "extra": {}}
