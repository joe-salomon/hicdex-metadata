Today\u2014thanks to fast internet, watching no longer has to be centered on an object called television. Streaming services have become a natural thing for every individual, in any part of the world.\n\nWe all love watching movies and series. For me, watching is a relaxing thing. One day, I felt that every series I watched had a unique \"blueprint\", and was different from one another.\n\nUsing slow speed, I try to photograph what I'm watching, and capture its uniqueness. This act, something feels natural. Because in everyday life, we are used to copying images into new images, with different meanings, and different needs.\n\n(From Peaky Blinders TV Series)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXsYAx25CLvA8iMaiCZNqPD6UHBAGr6j92Sm1XXFYRhjM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNx8KG1VEsAFFQAPF1N2B8eGvVCzspQPqdGxExGzuFHRR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXsYAx25CLvA8iMaiCZNqPD6UHBAGr6j92Sm1XXFYRhjM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UbeyXgCJ2MCdn9p529oDGNDPk9Fr1BZtH"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "tv", "series", "slowspeed", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
