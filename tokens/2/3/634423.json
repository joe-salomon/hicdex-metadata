We find our power by acknowledging that our being is constituted of multiple qualities, expressions, possible identities and dimensions. In every moment there is a possibility of multiple ways to express ourselves, to enact our being and to respond to the circumstances. And in every moment of being, there are many dimensions and levels of being that constitute who we are. An ever open portal of potential for the unfolding of our being that can never be fully described, limited or conceptualized. To be human is in many ways to be an open ended question and quest of what it means to be self, an open exploration and unfolding without a predetermined end - always a possibility and countless threads that emanate from us in all directions and an multiple levels. Ours is the eye we choose to look with, ours is the I we choose to identify as and ours is the choice we use to enact our beingness with.
