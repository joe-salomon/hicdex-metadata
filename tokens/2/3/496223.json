The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: Eli C. says he is against war but at the same time supports it when done by land or sea. \u2028Brian and I exit the hotel, walking through the long grassy meadow to where the highway heads north. We are here to visit my grandmother. There she is, her old cottage on a small island, its clear blue waterglasses. A waitress retrieves some of the island\u2019s remaining food. I say \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d  She says she can\u2019t take us too close to it. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d she says. \u201cMy job is to see you in court.\u201d\u00a0I say, \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d She nods solemnly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cYou should go, pal. This is serious.\u201d We start walking.\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 126 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma5VZo5CEAAoHB3RUYHkTCR8JEgtsqm23c9v2g4CHsSyY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTErQiymjLgcJXHqrsGFQFz3j37mGewxNZptZhW2aREGY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma5VZo5CEAAoHB3RUYHkTCR8JEgtsqm23c9v2g4CHsSyY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
