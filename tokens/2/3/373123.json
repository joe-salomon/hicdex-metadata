{"__version": 1, "token_id": 373123, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "MORE THAN THIS (ROXY MUSIC)", "description": "Roxy Music's song \"More Than This\" from their 1982 album \"Avalon\", could possibly be one of the greatest rock songs of that era. That's great that you like the song Andrew, but how the hell is that art? Great question. Frontman/Singer Bryan Ferry is such a poignant lyricist. When you read these words over and over again, it speaks of being in the moment, being present, having the omniscient wisdom to know there really isn't anything more than this. It is full acceptance of how things are and how they will be. To have that kind of clarity in a song, how could I not make a work of art from a work of art and present their work to a whole new audience? Think of it as making a cover of a song in a completely different medium. You'll probably see more works like this later on.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVab7ogsYB98QNJHJMEkzpaGEVH823LG6puuUbuxdtKyh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY8BAtAXKY4yGZCLX7oeM8xuqHedAwPraprc7u3TP3rNS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVab7ogsYB98QNJHJMEkzpaGEVH823LG6puuUbuxdtKyh", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
