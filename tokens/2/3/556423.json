The images are created from video footage of human movement, tracked and reimposed to capture all of the physical positions of the subject during a one second movement \u2014 these layered compositions are then volume displaced to generate a further physical dimension based on the speed and tone of each pixel. The resulting images form human clouds, digitally crafted from tracked movement data.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUKfjK3TvXnrZXFRShQ46QPqURSxBRkcXvj4xe6bSzdBk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWC2yyWgBjKuJ6GLrAR9ApMUJyvgqXDuQpUZaDi74w1jC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUKfjK3TvXnrZXFRShQ46QPqURSxBRkcXvj4xe6bSzdBk", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aDqNpyHBF9MRFQZbYaQXKph6AfeMJQeLV"], "tags": ["digital", "art", "displacement", "human", "cloud", "data"], "extra": {}}
