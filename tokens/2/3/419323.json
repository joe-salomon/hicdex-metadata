{"__version": 1, "token_id": 419323, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "UNFOLDINGS - gre_115 / GOLD", "description": "Unfolding of a gre_115 sparse matrix into a lattice. The original matrix is a directed weighted graph first documented by Francois Cachard in 1981. In this simulation, the matrix is represented as a lattice with 115 nodes and 421 edges which undergoes a process of unfolding until it reaches equilibrium. Simulation is based on Fruchterman and Reingold's method for force-directed placement of nodes which includes both attraction (between nodes connected with edges) as well as repulsion (between all nodes). This piece was produced as an experiment in computational design research on lattice algebras. \n\n@lukapiskorec, mp4, 1000 x 1000 pix, 300 frames", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXFhzDXGoCMHS5g6F47ULD3FjPgXjL9WgMLCRzJxhth4y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYBbpLQtKfwQKdNC5k8R5VkxkwbWpp1xgG2HQ4HLsv2KZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXFhzDXGoCMHS5g6F47ULD3FjPgXjL9WgMLCRzJxhth4y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Lkgy2gYECvVK55yyiwjbSSZeUoQp8Azxo"], "tags": ["lattice", "sculpture", "procedural", "generative", "algorithmic", "computational", "animation", "3D", "structure", "organic", "crystal", "geometric", "abstract", "architectural", "design", "graph", "matrix", "algebra", "unfoldings", "unfoldingsgold"], "extra": {}}
