Abstraction 11 is dedicated to the artistic interpretation of the \"Metaball\", \"Voronoi diagram\" and \"Delaunay triangulation\". Standard patterns whose settings are linked to each other in specific way to draw the algorithmic abstract artwork. The artwork shows the energy of some abstract processes in relationship of linked algorithms. Four charged points are  transforming the space around and are forming the whole image of the new geometric canvas.
