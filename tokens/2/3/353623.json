His upbringing is complete. With the sea and spirit calmer, the vision and discernment become sharper. Having a clearer observation, his worldview solidifies. Death begins to haunt. He is in the fullness of his faculties. He knows his existence better and can guide the tide and his surroundings at will, but he still has a lot to learn. \nThe artwork represents Poseidon traveling the depths of the ocean mounted on a stingray, avoiding the death that stalks him, escorted by a shoal.\n\n2000x2047px\n\nFull story here: nft.matiasmarano.com/renaissance", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTcZy9n6nj4RgMcmZtUCPCPSPCLgpyfPFWpCBhsLaetCY", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYQagptz6CsmXduqzzrz29PFMCrLj3ryQoqkJtdWEKvD3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTcZy9n6nj4RgMcmZtUCPCPSPCLgpyfPFWpCBhsLaetCY", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2NzvDGTtWUd195Yi5YewHXSY6mEwbmWjF4"], "tags": ["illustration", "renaissance", "2d", "contemporaryart", "fineart", "digitalillustration", "painting", "poseidon", "nfts", "collection", "paint", "neptune", "ocean", "stingray", "skull", "fish", "shoal", "snake", "seabottom"], "extra": {}}
