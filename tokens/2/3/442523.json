Over the course of four days, the app scanned Twitter for stuff people were bitching about and connected these subjects to photos on Flickr, by using the same tag and geo location. Then, the public used a touch screen table, rigged with a drawing engine, to give bored tweets abstract, visual form. The artwork became a collaboration between the real users who physically interacted with the application and Twitter & Flickr participants. Physical interactions defined the composition of the artwork and some aspects of its look, while Twitter & Flickr users directly affected the rules that guided the engine's colors, shapes, sizes and behaviors.\n\nAttributes:\n\nTweet: \"It is boring\"\n\nLocation: London, UK\n\nTweets: Unknown\n\nPhotos Sampled: 3\n\nDate Generated: April 28, 2011", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQrXcDCsBHZt6SiJHEKsDSyKyQUqLyJVz7e9rk8RFBBMB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQutvVSWeSrB4Gfm1TQqnZXmk2RFhJq8YY8GiMCBL6pbW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQrXcDCsBHZt6SiJHEKsDSyKyQUqLyJVz7e9rk8RFBBMB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2MMhTLqYFE8sJYXNpNMCqoMgVdcE6Tx3TT"], "tags": ["twitter", "generative", "art", "creativecoding", "algoart", "mathart", "generativeart", "particlesystem", "sampling", "sentiment", "boring", "gallery", "set"], "extra": {}}
