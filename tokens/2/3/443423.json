The result is used to paint a color for this exact pixel. \n\nThe result is a huge collection of pseudo-fractal images which evoke impossible landscapes, crowded cities, glitchy psychedelic with vivid colors or just beautiful patterns. All of them are deterministic given its initial parameters.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfGWjHSgoFyfEN7JMx7kVtjC433d5kb3e8eWczMZS6Ckq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfGWjHSgoFyfEN7JMx7kVtjC433d5kb3e8eWczMZS6Ckq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfGWjHSgoFyfEN7JMx7kVtjC433d5kb3e8eWczMZS6Ckq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1SpToaU7V2HkUJ3KjJmRFx9k2XFAJH5Sc6"], "tags": ["js", "script", "art", "generative", "fractal", "unique", "glitch", "algorithmic", "codeart", "genart", "colorful", "creativecode", "abstract", "math"], "extra": {}}
