A FALLEN COLOSSUS, WORN OUT AND TIRED OF WALKING STRAIGHT AHEAD. A STRAIGHT, CONSTANT, RAW JOURNEY. STOP BY FORGETTING TIME AND TRUSTING THE IMMUTABLE.\nA MISTAKE TO THINK THAT THIS MATTER IS SAID TO BE IMPERISHABLE. ONE MISTAKE, ONE FAILURE, STRANDED, RUN AGROUND, IMPERCEPTIBLE STOP. HOW TO REALIZE THAT EVERYTHING HAS STOPPED WHEN YOU HAVE LIVED SO LONG WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD.\nLETHARGY SETS IN. THE STILLNESS OF BODY AND MIND. A FEAR LOOMS AND CUTS THE MISTS. IT IS ABOUT THE CHOICE TO MOVE FORWARD OR TO CONTINUE TO THINK THAT EVERYTHING HAS ALWAYS BEEN MOVING FORWARD.
