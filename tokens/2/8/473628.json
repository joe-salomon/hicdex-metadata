The next track of sound nft is generated today/ 25.10.2021 This is procedural sound I made with my custom instrument - node based synthesizer I created custom coding in the software of Max/Msp. It is a combination of generative \"golden ratio\" based sequencer, power of \"2\", granular sound,  additive synthesis and some tricks with realtime rhythmic/harmonic structure.  All components are recorded in realtime from the live algorithm.  Liverecord of manipulations with algorhythms. listen / use / mix.  No external sound effects are used. Pure wave physics.  Microsound. \n\ntotal duration 3:37\nsample rate 48000/16bit\nstereo / .wav\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTxLCd7VCPTqs1V3GKVYH6o3PMKfxjJTjEqaeNWBNW2JS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaJNvScNLMmzii2Lst5znKfRZftpgrhDBFjmLuireytuR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTxLCd7VCPTqs1V3GKVYH6o3PMKfxjJTjEqaeNWBNW2JS", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1Mpr7WD3UG47UFPbizLPnBCNhh8pcdbSyz"], "tags": ["sound", "algorithm", "procedural", "custom", "coding", "algorithmic", "realtime", "additive", "synthesis", "granular", "random", "form", "microsound", "pure", "wave", "oscillators", "harmonic", "composition", "hi-res", "lossless", "48000", "16bit", "stereo", "goldenratio", "power", "2", "rhythm", "ringtone", "sample", "henradio", "noise", "experimental"], "extra": {}}
