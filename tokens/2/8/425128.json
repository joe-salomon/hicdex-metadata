Doing one work after another according to your understanding of composition, you can put all your works together and also get an ideal composition from your point of view. And it is also possible to trace the entire path of the artist from the bottom to the top and also to put together from this path an ideal composition according to your understanding. That is what I mean! The form gives birth to an image, but even if it does not give birth, then you can at least be content with pure beauty, without these images and thoughts. Because it's just beautiful! The End!\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmecG2zHzqLMZK3mpAoydKGBnUrwz6F7mmW289pWcSwnYU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfRmPYwXgUf6gELhYzZ5cksQCJeLaKY1X9NHfRkKJmq1D", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmecG2zHzqLMZK3mpAoydKGBnUrwz6F7mmW289pWcSwnYU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2JzFRU41CfmaWj12iqz6GAKJjgy9pE4pQC"], "tags": ["Suprematism", "form", "color", ""], "extra": {}}
