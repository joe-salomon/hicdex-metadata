Strong governance helped remove much of the corruption but the icing on the \u2018big apple\u2019 was the blockchain. \u2028\u2028\n\nThis futuristic street art neon curation is focussed on \u2018Times Square\u2019.  Time has passed\u2026Time stops for no-one.  \u2028\u2028\n\nCrypto Aliens have traversed and time-traveled to earth via the blockchain.  \u2028\u2028Crypto Alien Babes (CAB) with their epic human partners have saved the world from the \u2018dark ones\u2019 from disrupting the blockchain.  The CAB anime animation series is now celebrating its 1000th episode. \n\n\u2028\u2028This 2025 image of NYC is a retro look back on CAB\u2019s humble beginnings and Eggs incubating before their famed launch back in November 19/20th, 2021.  You can even spot Xenot on the billboards.\u2028\u2028The CAB NFT community is world-renowned for its charity work and selfless acts.  Transparency is the key currency of CAB and the blockchain.\u2028\u2028\n\nPeople no longer have to second guess governments.  Banking is no longer \u2018hide-and-go-seek\u2019.  Everything is out in the open.  It\u2019s almost impossible to take \u2018bribes\u2019 anymore.  No more middle-man.   \n\nThe world is DAO run.\u2028\u2028The Grow Group, IDO platform \u2018Equinox\u2019, CAB, and our very own \u2018Starseed\u2019 brand -  thanks to their incredible communities - have exposed the bad actors in the crypto industry. The industry is now humming along with excitement. \u2028\u2028\n\nNYC NFT 2025 is close to my heart. I first started my career in modeling there.  I established the \u2018Pangaea\u2019  brand.  And started my deep love affair with photography and art. \u2028\n\n\nBack in 2021, NFT\u2019s were a simple way for anyone to enter \u2018crypto\u2019. They helped to bring \u2018crypto\u2019 to the universe.  Provably authentic. Transparent provenance. Secure yet globally and instantly accessible. Royalty monetization for creatives, enhanced liquidity are just some of the benefits of NFT\u2019s.\n\n\u2028\u2028Thank you once again for being part of the change.  \u2028\u2028Long live CAB, NOX, GROW, XENOT, EQUINOX and their awesome communities.   \u2028\n\nLove,  Starseed", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYSuh7UDhS7yxxit4d3gQpLeBbwJyTwr57DnKrT46drT5", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd8Miw3Mi1Ug3LR9dJ8GQ6ahWRrufryEw9YT2TVBmFwtE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYSuh7UDhS7yxxit4d3gQpLeBbwJyTwr57DnKrT46drT5", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1g7wtAtGgwA68PS3VTeKm2mELk5efosM72"], "tags": ["NOX", "XENOT", "CAB", "CryptoAlienBabes", "Grow", "Equinox"], "extra": {}}
