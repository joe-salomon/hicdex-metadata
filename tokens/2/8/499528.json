The canvas painting I made in 2020 I based on my old modeling shoot photograph from 2006 and mixed with inspirational words that I felt described myself and my beautiful friend I created this for. I wanted to see what it was like to run the photograph of the canvas through deep dream. The result was stunning! I hope you enjoy!!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdHPMmBEJ36xkrptrF3LQoDA61o4S1NoyBi5xPwqoWUPP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdHPMmBEJ36xkrptrF3LQoDA61o4S1NoyBi5xPwqoWUPP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdHPMmBEJ36xkrptrF3LQoDA61o4S1NoyBi5xPwqoWUPP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2Dpf7uop3Cp2DJ1SdXCs4ZxykAHXe9dTQY"], "tags": ["mixed-medium", "paintpour", "canvas", "deepdream", "lmdesigns8"], "extra": {}}
