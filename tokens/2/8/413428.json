What could we have done to take over the control?\nIt is not easy to oppose the essence of reality, especially when all you know is your own value. Since we exist on an infinite, straight line the ultimate act of rebellion is to stand against its determined direction. And conservatively explore a new plane using the only measure known to us - ourselves.\nAnd rightly so, because at this point, looking exactly from this point at our dimension, we have experienced the absolute.\nWhen the brave ones went exploring new direction, the rest of us stayed in line, observing carefully. It was a very special moment. Not only because we took our fate in our hands, but also, during this process, we saw the sacred value that builds the Bezmiar.\nWhen the brave ones looked back at the observers their gaze met in very non-accidental place.\nThe division that arose during this exchange of views is called a number Fi (\u03c6) and is the basis for both my and your world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTHAoJ7hCAsjSSNz8TkWvBSAZDUHHwEihvZsNhwRxJVzb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPR7JQYQHu6rHyNjZ1magRUMbNpcaW8LZLX7vgn95uC2o", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTHAoJ7hCAsjSSNz8TkWvBSAZDUHHwEihvZsNhwRxJVzb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QvQiJY21xcfmPGZD7qqTGsJJEW3geuwt6"], "tags": ["monochrome", "geometry", "Bezmiar", "chapter", "dimension", "grayscale", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
