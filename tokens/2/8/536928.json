The outer shell, keyboard and disc drive seem to have been repurposed from ancient hardware dating from the late 20th century. The computer itself has no visible power source and runs from pure energy channelled from the earth's core.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmStYwCLfNjXzs1nJqKrZBQ9CnP3KBK9BjqSSZJZm2wD6i", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX3wxsMXbfX4zVeU6NeuXUQuYtgBbP8YHdfSop4ZWDTM7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmStYwCLfNjXzs1nJqKrZBQ9CnP3KBK9BjqSSZJZm2wD6i", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1T9o7A7mPipMNVoYM38hGBfVNXSUoAXSCa"], "tags": ["3danimation", "3dart", "crystal", "tech", "hen1000", "objkt4objkt", "500k", ""], "extra": {}}
