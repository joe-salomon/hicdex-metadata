She married an official with a steady income as soon as he was released from prison. Even though she didn't want to, she gave birth to a child for this man who paid her bills. That child served as a convenient justification for not stopping their financial arrangement. She required this justification because, as we subsequently learned, she surreptitiously organizes gambling nights and demands her cut by mediating for sex workers present. Her commanding manner came in handy at home as well as on gambling evenings. While her husband basked in his dominance in her bedroom, she kept a watchful eye on her child. The clearest thing I remember about that woman was the smell of coffee and cigarettes emanating from her lips while she was talking.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSBCHrYPxU5oisaCEPyT6Szs7ffaPGuAXN6XX4zMHE7td", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSBCHrYPxU5oisaCEPyT6Szs7ffaPGuAXN6XX4zMHE7td", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSBCHrYPxU5oisaCEPyT6Szs7ffaPGuAXN6XX4zMHE7td", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1dZDMAtyxM9nowWZm589fNAx3PXPtD9ZLX"], "tags": ["photography", "gif", "doodles", "experimental", "analog", "collectible", "collectibles"], "extra": {}}
