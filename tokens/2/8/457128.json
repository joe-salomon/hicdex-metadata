The Towers are generated with natural stone patterns along algorithm of \"substrate\". The original pattern is highlighted with lines constantly. The 4 cameras are flying around the same towers elliptically and forming the \"Quadro Proection\" of the perspectives. Tops of the towers are grown from the 120 cells of \"substrate\" with 3d extrusion of  random seed 8544. The base plane is intersected with towers and moving as dark sections in between the base and tops.
