It also is a way to deal with the haters in the world. Sounds simple enough, but it takes practice. Works for me considering the amount of trolls I used to get on Instagram. Haters will always be there. It's human nature to be like crabs in a bucket...just when one is about to get out of the bucket, another crab pulls them back in. You'd think by this point in our evolution we would have ceased to be this petty and become enlightened individuals. I give humanity too much credit sometimes, but I remain hopeful that all the haters in the world will learn valuable lessons in their lives to help change their perspectives. Life is way too short to give a crap about some unconstructive and unsolicited malarkey that only serves to diminish your light. Nope...not today haters. Now constructive criticism is welcomed of course.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXbgQzukNaX7w8ArwUWxn6wdrZxPp6HgPZLBZahk1BmMp", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcJ3caiGRtgQUikQV55bEDwFcQkDosJgjYs12T9MCpdbd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXbgQzukNaX7w8ArwUWxn6wdrZxPp6HgPZLBZahk1BmMp", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
