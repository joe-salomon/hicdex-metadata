Little is known about the contents of this work as scholars who have dedicated their time to its study have forgotten its contents after reading. Cataloging of notes, when attempted, has been so far unsuccessful. It is speculated by some that the Compendium contains all recorded pacts, bargains, and agreements made between humans and unknown (presumably dark) entities, though this theory raises further questions: who are the humans of this Other Reality? And to whom might they be offering themselves in exchange for short-lived gains? \n\nDimensions: 2694 x 1935 | 93.6MB", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV2yRYQWksAxmudwuTvT5AgJaHtQBrgLSrbzxDEQs5tBq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV2yRYQWksAxmudwuTvT5AgJaHtQBrgLSrbzxDEQs5tBq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV2yRYQWksAxmudwuTvT5AgJaHtQBrgLSrbzxDEQs5tBq", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1NbFeTRxDGzAkdYjNVihUcdaLoxjUT5mxc"], "tags": ["darknft", "occult", "book", "scholar", "academia", "unreality", "ghostshoes", "gif"], "extra": {}}
