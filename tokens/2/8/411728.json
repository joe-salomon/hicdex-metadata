I watched you glide by in white.\"\n\"I wasn\u2019t in white.\"\n\"You know what should have happened?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I should have had you, in your white, before the wedding. I should have blackened you, in your white wedding dress, blackened you in your bridal dress, before ushering you into your wedding, as your best man.\"\n\n\nThat's it. Betrayal is always about inversion. Getting things as they are and turning them into something it should have never meant to be.\n\n\n.\nTWISTERS is a project about inconstant and changeable human nature and about different ways people may react to something that doesn't fit their expectations. Based on a wordplay when the word \"twist\" can have several meanings.\n.\n\nOriginal animation 1500x1500 px, 30 fps. \nInitially minted in edition of 10 copies.\nTWISTERS is the original series of abstract animated artworks by Olga Feldman.\nQuote is from \"Betrayal\" by H.
