We support each other emotionally and in every aspect of our lives. If you feel like you don't fit in or that you don't belong you need to find your tribe even if its just one other person who gets you. They are out there that's for sure just follow the things that you love like markers along the way.\nWhen this card comes up it's time to put the focus on your tribe. There are times for solitude and there are times for human connection, both are necessary for our health. Who are the ones who support you? Who makes you feel nourished after you leave their presence? Who do you nourish? This card is above all here for you to consider who your tribe is. It is pointing out that no matter what's going on in your life there is at least one other human being on the planet that can give you a powerful sense of connection and belonging, one person that can be there for you in the way you need it. Focus on what tribe means for you and what relation it has to the answer you seek in these cards.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQEuEMbUFkXwPUvxJgccHyHGbFYDwFNUeWJFFHdCHzRPj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS17D4iD4kQfjdjRRYp14kVfnDcrsXM924hy1xSJfSV4M", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQEuEMbUFkXwPUvxJgccHyHGbFYDwFNUeWJFFHdCHzRPj", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
