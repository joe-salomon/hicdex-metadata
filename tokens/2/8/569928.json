Autobiographical abstraction.\n\nBINARY pieces obey a set of rules in that they must be constructed using only 2 x white blocks on a black canvas. With these constraints, each canvas is an abstract representation of an autobiographical tale.\n\nSO WE WAITED FOR FIREWORKS\n--------\nThe rain had stopped hours before but its echo remained as puddles that doubled the street lamps.  \nAll around, the rest of the city huddled in little orange boxes, whilst we planned to walk until our feet stopped working. It was too cold for it, really - but we could only go out when everyone else was in. \nSomehow though, that was a gift.\nIt forced us into the space *between* spaces. \nDrove us down the path *between* the paths everyone else took. \nSo, that night, we explored their world as foxes; tongued the seams of the city, and made it our own. \nThen, finally, when we'd mapped each shadow, we came to rest on a bench that looked out over the suburbs below. \nIt was November 5th so, as the wind began to whip, we simply held each other in silence, and waited \n- for fireworks. \n ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVkmL8pe7aeWb87U4ZxhuMEG4KfreVknjaRf7aiSeKY5D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdLMHEHeZkMYL3S3H5Zc5zrurnu4XHtK9cy6CLG2JTazu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVkmL8pe7aeWb87U4ZxhuMEG4KfreVknjaRf7aiSeKY5D", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WqiSCF73e2YK85VL2EXrgL5oti3AkJEKf"], "tags": ["literary", "abstract", "abstractexpressionism", "fineart", "abstractart", "minimalism", "minimalistart"], "extra": {}}
