It was also printed in quite a few books and magazines and even on a special edition beer bottle (a filtering failure brew by EuroTrash Brewery)\nhttps://beyondresolution.info/Glitch-Studies-Manifesto\n\n\nHere is the short version: \n\n1. The dominant, continuing search for a noiseless channel has been \u2013 and will always be \u2013 no more than a regrettable, ill-fated dogma.\nAcknowledge that although the constant search for complete transparency brings newer, \u2018better\u2019 media, every one of these improved techniques will always possess their own inherent fingerprints of imperfection.\n\n2. Dispute the operating templates of creative practice; fight genres, interfaces and expectations!\nRefuse to stay locked into one medium or between contradictions like real vs. virtual, obsolete vs. up-to-date, open vs. proprietary or digital vs. analog. Surf the vortex of technology, the in-between, the art of artifacts!\n\n3. Get away from the established action scripts and join the avant-garde of the unknown. Become a nomad of noise artifacts!\nThe static, linear notion of information-transmission can be interrupted on three occasions: during encoding-decoding (compression), feedback or when a glitch (an unexpected break within the flow of technology) occurs. Noise artists must exploit these noise artifacts and explore the new opportunities they provide.\n\n4. Employ bends and breaks as metaphors for diffe\u0301rance. Use the glitch as an exoskeleton for progress.\nFind catharsis in disintegration, ruptures and cracks; manipulate, bend and break any medium towards the point where it becomes something new; create glitch art.\n\n5. Realize that the gospel of glitch art also reveals new standards implemented by corruption. Not all glitch art is progressive or something new.\nThe popularization and cultivation of the avant-garde of mishaps has become predestined and unavoidable. Be aware of easily reproducible glitch effects automated by softwares and plug-ins. What is now a glitch will become a fashion.\n\n6. Force the audience to voyage through the Acousmatic Videoscape.\nCreate conceptually synaesthetic artworks, that exploit both visual and aural glitch (or other noise) artifacts at the same time. Employ these noise artifacts as a nebula that shroudsthe technology and its inner workings and that will compel an audience to listen and watch more exhaustively.\n\n7. Rejoice in the critical trans-media aesthetics of glitch artifacts.\nUtilize glitches to bring any medium in a critical state of hypertrophy, to (subsequently) criticize its inherent politics.\n\n8. Employ Glitchspeak (as opposed to Newspeak) and study what is outside of knowledge. Glitch theory is what you can just get away with!\nFlow cannot be understood without interruption, nor can function without (the possibility of) glitching. This is why glitch studies is necessary.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZgwpSbZBvNhEvqDdtDxLEUBoZ4qoXsCrePDyjyycX3XL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbkqcqD3MtiZibuJ3jLhoTn7S1Y2CNX94xzsww15Gfb2S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZgwpSbZBvNhEvqDdtDxLEUBoZ4qoXsCrePDyjyycX3XL", "mimeType": "application/pdf"}], "creators": ["tz2UMmSdhQjLYCbZrRCdWgXey1FahcGVzR3W"], "tags": ["glitch", "glitchart", "glitchstudies", "pdf", "artpdf", "iRD", "Glitchspeak"], "extra": {}}
