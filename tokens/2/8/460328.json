The dogs of the riverside houses are always the same type. Ounce\u00b4s smell is like bitter cheese. Women avoid looking into the eyes. Everybody is family. Infinite types of birds color the greens. Brasilia is S\u00e3o Paulo from here. The light generator doesn't turn off until the soap opera is over. Seeing an ounce here is more common than being mugged in Rio de Janeiro. Summer is in August, winter in February. Human being is just another passing animal. The rush has gone into extinction. Copa\u00edba, andiroba, baba\u00e7u. Omnipresent clouds and mosquitoes. Tucunar\u00e9, acari, catitu, tracaj\u00e1, surubim, porc\u00e3o and mutum are meal. The forest has fortune, houses don't. Two rooms at most, seven children minimum.\n\nArtist: Ricardo Elia\n\nImage: Rio Iriri, Par\u00e1, Brasil.\n2376 X 1783\n704 KB\nJpg\n2014\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYtR7T1XjWsinq4zjR2gs8ZMSQqiKiiDGszzDqDcrqv5o", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQmuzGDsswpuXSJpsfnYUtqTz8v6DhwH9U8ekbhCr3pJb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYtR7T1XjWsinq4zjR2gs8ZMSQqiKiiDGszzDqDcrqv5o", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dcAaaWz5zfnaQ7srri5WbrogyagJDbC57"], "tags": ["amazon", "forest", "brazil", "brasil", "para", "birds", "rush", "ecology", "global", "local", "mosquito", "ounce", "river", "riverside", "human", "image", "photo", "animal", "travel", "diary", "expedition", "water"], "extra": {}}
