It can be seen from many near and far places but the best view is from Soberbo's viewpoint.\n\nTo feel the photo: It's mid morning in Rio's mountainous region, the sun is hot but the air is chilly and there's a moderate wind flowing all the time. It's a trip to gather with the family and chill out.\n\nAbout the series: Pictures taken in and around the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park ('Parque Nacional da Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os' in portuguese or its abbreviation 'PARNASO'), located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and covers a huge area across four municipalities.\n\nEquipment: Nikon D5100 + Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED VR\nLocation: Soberbo's Viewpoint - Teres\u00f3polis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaK22PywueRVpV3V5k8u5kUyFXo3HuzMCKijFEt5kcXgr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQxapwL5StgSsi5pCD25o36mwiXo1zuEKFAgjPpW2MPL1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaK22PywueRVpV3V5k8u5kUyFXo3HuzMCKijFEt5kcXgr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1V6koMbi6iWRpgrh9ULh6M2R7QhBgwGcjn"], "tags": ["fingerofgod", "dedodedeus", "parnaso", "nationalpark", "atlanticforest", "rainforest", "forest", "mountain", "peak", "sierra", "green", "nature", "naturephotography", "landscape", "landscapephotography", "brazil", "madeinbrazil", "riodejaneiro", "rio", "feelthephoto"], "extra": {}}
