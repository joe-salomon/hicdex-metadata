This mode of transportation is available in various non-protocol roads in Jakarta and mainly serves as an alternative for short-distance rides.In this work, i imagine the future of bajaj as public transportation. But, yeah, future predictions have been proven wrong again and again. In my view, it is a pointless activity.
