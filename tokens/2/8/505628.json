To disguise herself and do her mission, Cheonsa runs Coffee Cat, a caf\u00e9 that caters to all animals in town. Her most frequent customers are Danny Dog, Rita Rabbit, Paulie Penguin, Chase Chick, Owen Owl and Barry Bear. Each of them has his/her own likes and dislikes as well as good and bad traits. With her yummy food and drinks, little pieces of advice and some help with their needs, Cheonsa inspires them to become better versions of themselves. This NFT is one of Cheonsa's friends and caf\u00e9 customers, Danny Dog.\n\nDanny Dog is an overworked employee of a small company. Because he is often dog-tired, he is often grouchy, stingy and complains even about the smallest of things. He goes to the caf\u00e9 to relax after a hard day\u2019s work. However, he works really hard. He is also knowledgeable about a lot of things. His sincerity and loyalty are unquestionable.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRCTjcH1euSzTPgDQUZJhxJsxu3xbCjGjsSEEiYQJqh2q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRCTjcH1euSzTPgDQUZJhxJsxu3xbCjGjsSEEiYQJqh2q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRCTjcH1euSzTPgDQUZJhxJsxu3xbCjGjsSEEiYQJqh2q", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QDfxJj5XEpGdnJMEbDYJLMUkpZiHiTUGQ"], "tags": ["collection", "collectibles", "gif", "character", "cute", "animals", "animated", "cartoon", "image", "animatedgif", "dog", "puppy", ""], "extra": {}}
