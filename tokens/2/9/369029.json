The first soundscape out of the Breaking The Frontiers series is dedicated to the mixture of fascination, solitude, and excitement when facing the unknown depths of the cosmos. The artwork is completely original and fully embodies the sound metaphor.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUctMnV7D22UjmMWs3keyjM34MQsYm65HCKHbgYkVG8o1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSDNCprMZxfv2dnN3rdpUE77fEM99ermphc2QBPZiZQxD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUctMnV7D22UjmMWs3keyjM34MQsYm65HCKHbgYkVG8o1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1d9FJ3sCw9tros8Loc1bNknXQ3gVVQ58U9"], "tags": ["audio", "music", "digitalart", "originalart", "sounddesign", "soundart", "soundscape", "videoart", "tape", "lofi"], "extra": {}}
