I played the bass, crafted the drums, and made all the horns and bells. i have waited to show this to people for a while so if you pick some editions up, send me a dm on twitter so i can get you on the list for future releases and send you the audio file to keep. thank you for listening.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmePFn6YSs5d28ZyXQsTndoJ3ZnfjSE98vUM39ksLhkaWM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNwQP7X9WcpFvBXZLSfBZehBsHzeUw4ERA1e7W81KkCW4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmePFn6YSs5d28ZyXQsTndoJ3ZnfjSE98vUM39ksLhkaWM", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1TLpwWw7hoiPcXAdeGPukwYEAFvgJphh8t"], "tags": ["hiphop", "r&b", "soul", "lofi", "vintage", "music", "beats", "audio", "instrumental", "remcycles"], "extra": {}}
