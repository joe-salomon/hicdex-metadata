She was nice enough to shoot with me after she had already spent a full day modeling for a group shoot. She's a badass and a total sweetheart! \n\nAnyway, still my first day, 3rd NFT, and I'm still figuring it out but I have high hopes for what I'm seeing so far. I'm not very good at selling myself or doing work for other people so I've always struggled a bit financially. It's worth it to get to shoot what I want when I want. I'm hoping to finally find a home for my work where people appreciate it so please take a look at the rest of my creations and feel free to contact me at the links in my bio if you have any questions.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQoDnMTgbMCezKbhGVkQhwspoFeqgi7gAt5a5LEoYBED9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcgDS54vJwbg1YYNgMkgUkeTBdJxkEbvzXo79Z2hnDi83", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQoDnMTgbMCezKbhGVkQhwspoFeqgi7gAt5a5LEoYBED9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["keithallenphillips", "woman", "artnude", "nudity", "nsfw", "nudeart", "nude", "erotic", "nft", "sexy", "photography", "model", "photo", "Blonde", "Petite", "hotel", "hotelroom", "creepy", "strange"], "extra": {}}
