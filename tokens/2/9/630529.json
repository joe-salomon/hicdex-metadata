{"__version": 1, "token_id": 630529, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BYE MOTION BY E MOTION BY EMOTION", "description": "It's been awhile since the last BLG. In this example, we share the letter \"E\" between BY and MOTION. In doing so, we create a subtle and somewhat absurd narrative that can be described as a certain type of 'catty' passive aggressiveness. To signify the abrupt end to a contemptuous discussion, Person A says BYE and throws up a hand in MOTION and walks away BY EMOTION from Person B. Again, this is all a fictious narrative being born out of language abstraction. Do you see a different type of interpretation? What comes up for you? Does this say anything to you? Or is it devoid of any meaning that it's just absurd to you?
