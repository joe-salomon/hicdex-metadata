The original images depicted events of the current decade in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. These images are deconstructed and assembled into a new narrative that is more frustrating and obscure.\n\u2800\nElements of realism make them plausible but abstraction, realignments and mash-ups of the human form, color layering suggests the impossibility of constructing a meaningful whole from available fragments. They cause vague anxiety, from not being able to recognize the meaning and history behind the forms. This is an artefact of instability and uncertainty that characterizes our era.\n\u2800\ninstagram.com/romacasus\n\u2800\nwww.romacasus.cyou", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXu9CnY9agcS8VYcc1oKX9sZE8U9S9NeGBxcrVEAfkQof", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQk7j9jbzB33TuEfDE95EHQs4EyXmHdwGyzDxtmrgj9D4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXu9CnY9agcS8VYcc1oKX9sZE8U9S9NeGBxcrVEAfkQof", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WgJREjNG6xzWFH8QVtvAShgWB2CGEbJFL"], "tags": ["paintingoiloncanvastraditionaloilpaintingwitness_casusblind"], "extra": {}}
