{"__version": 1, "token_id": 394729, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Glitch of Girl on a Hill (Prudence Heward, 1928)", "description": "The original painting by Heward depicts a strong young woman who fills the canvas, modeled on dancer Louise McLea, whose short hair and athletic body conveyed a new ideal of strength and freedom for women in the period between the two world wars. Heward was awarded first prize for the painting in a 1929 competition organized by the National Gallery of Canada. While she did exhibit with the (perhaps) more popular \"Group of Seven,\" her paintings almost always included the human figure, whereas theirs were mostly landscapes and nature scenes.  The glitch of Heward's work maintains the clearly recognizable figure of the girl and also maintains a sense of feminine strength.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmd9G2sULae83AkTK2UgTnkGUYEPQGpk8BktjgdvAATZ2d", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZCLdjYGbd1qtyUTsCNqwh2Lu8cGTgDkh8PUTyTX9Q7v8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmd9G2sULae83AkTK2UgTnkGUYEPQGpk8BktjgdvAATZ2d", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1KuDTfViBWjpmfFC6M3vRPF4M1cKqbTw2b"], "tags": ["glitch", "pixels", "feminine", "dancer", "digital"], "extra": {}}
