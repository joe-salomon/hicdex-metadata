In the short film the actor is not seen at Miami's \"Asian Fusion Cafe\" however I thought it would be a perfect fit to combine the two photos. Members of this cast are comprised of gold, crypto, and real estate investors. Our cast was strategically assembled to showcase some of Miami's local businesses and professionals. Also local business owners make cameo appearances and product placements. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQYKYXqVeE8tdTmKDhP2wVwTcSietHKwe5h6ELNs2ESod", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZZPjEDDRB2e1qFSFwPLXwtptefZqxo7miuXKdLQLzfbW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQYKYXqVeE8tdTmKDhP2wVwTcSietHKwe5h6ELNs2ESod", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fNeJE8UhZBDccynFt9n2ueBPmySb48W8W"], "tags": ["victims", "coroglobalmiami", "coroapp", "tezosnft", "soundtrack", "nftartwork", "nftmusic", "tezosart", "helphaitichallenge", "haiti", "music", "hedera", "xrparmy", "xlm", "film", "producer", "ingoldwetrust", "earthquake", "hbar", "loveforlocalbiz", "nftartist", "onemoretimenft", "cryptocurrency", "fundraising", "crowdsourcing", "nftproject", "charity"], "extra": {}}
