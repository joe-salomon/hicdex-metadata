This sculpture, created in September 2021, is part of a body of work I made during my first months on HRT as I was beginning to feel the effects take hold and watch the testosterone inflected view recede from my memory. This mass of sensation spun off a tremendous amount of artifacts. Sound, image, moving image, sculpture, and worlding work in this series is installed all around my virtual archipelago on New Art City, called \"well,\". \n\nYou can find one such installation here: https://newart.city/show/well-4?x=-978&z=823 and the hub world links out to over 20 worlds.
