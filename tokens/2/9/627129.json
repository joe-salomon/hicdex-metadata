I illustrate these bastions of our cultural heritage with a stylistic key that represents me. These first 3 designs are the beginning of a collection that over time I intend to extend paying tribute to the most acclaimed animals.\n\nTHE YACAR\u00c9\n(uncommon 48 editions)\n\nIts name means crocodile in the Guaran\u00ed language. It is a magnificent prehistoric creature that reaches reckless sizes and whose bite is one of the most lethal. Its indiscriminate hunting is dangerous for its conservation so in recent years measures are already being taken to help the species. I leave this illustration to you to remember the wonders that exist in Argentina.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc8eoeGvbmn1W8m5wv5NJWtHXnSF82wk3eSGdBHW8ij3o", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUFCG9yp5s6Fy8MeesJ7tFgmmLWVUEBTTkCatqmjmaj4n", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc8eoeGvbmn1W8m5wv5NJWtHXnSF82wk3eSGdBHW8ij3o", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2PefDbra1nQXTtTk58PPn6m6HYJDmj2WR5"], "tags": ["yacare", "animals", "art", "simbionte_arte"], "extra": {}}
