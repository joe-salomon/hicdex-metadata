This time I raised an issue that has often been heard, namely overconsumption. if we look at our nature, of course, we will realize that nature has a period to restore itself, while humans in the modern era force us to move fast, because we often force ourselves to race against time. After all, the pattern of competition is increasingly unhealthy.\n\nif we take what is in science, that the law of thermodynamics states that entropy makes natural systems tend to be chaotic so that they need the energy to make them orderly. what this has to do with over-consumption is if we use excessive resources then we will lose energy to restore nature which from there will pull us into a chaotic state.\n\nAdorno and Horkheimer said, long ago, \"Der Animismus hatte die Sache beseelt, der Industrialismus versachlicht die Seelen\" (in the past, animism animates things, and now industrialism also embodies souls).", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc5AQMYE4vkaE2Jpks4rkzALhRMzm1rL2Cc1AtELgf9Ek", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNo7euuibjPcHN65wGtPaq5LZ1RjzUbpp7eeQQbG6DF3E", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZy2wHo1oYyGfjcxBuzbxxcdW8NQQMKpgvhiDvTNew4MF", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc5AQMYE4vkaE2Jpks4rkzALhRMzm1rL2Cc1AtELgf9Ek", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bVRM23WrAzJ8ChXVW5Ax9wg6BntUPDvy8"], "tags": ["nft", "nftart", "nftindonesia", "earthnft", "cleannft", "tezos", "hicetnunc", "hicaf", "campaign", "artnft", "nftasia", "nftcommunity", "nftcollector"], "extra": {}}
