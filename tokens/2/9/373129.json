Ever so quickly! Where are we going? - the bird asked not thickly.\n-Going we ain\u2019t -said the rabiest of rabbits- we are going, you are staying, we are not changing habits. The man with the fire awaits with our meal, he\u2019s not one to wait or to welcome a squeal.\n-But why can\u2019t I go -said the flying hornero- I promise to be both quiet and narrow!\n-You promise for sure not to be disrespectful? \n-I promise for sure to not be unforgetful!\n\nThey sat at the table of the man with the fire.\n-Remember hornero don\u2019t offend the supplier!\nThe hornero tried hard to don this attire, pushing and pushing his highest desire, but then he saw something that shook him entire: the man had his balls aflame like a pyre!\n\nWith one burst of laughter disaster began: fire was plenty and everyone ran.\nYet the man was so angry he made a mistake: he let loose the one thing that made him el rey. The forest burnt bright but later regrew, and people could cook and dance more than two.\nFire would later be used to do harm but there was a time when it worked like a charm: thanks to the hornero who knew to disarm the power that held them twisting their arms.\n\nTo bring back the warmth that comes with the laughter, to laugh in the face of what some call disaster!/\n\nTale of the Hornero and the Man of Fire, part of Wich\u00ed culture.\n\n\ud835\ude14\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34 (@\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34_\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude34) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNsyKAHWvn8atznepXDh5FxwdM7gtuvAW9Jk5qoyCV9Dh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVku49yagsUGCqR86XYVFA9FJXYRQQrYKSE7xW1psZsf7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNsyKAHWvn8atznepXDh5FxwdM7gtuvAW9Jk5qoyCV9Dh", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
