{"__version": 1, "token_id": 327029, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "HOMELESS WITH HEART? / HEARTLESS WITH HOME?", "description": "A lot of my work digs deep into the inequities of things or systems. Of these two sentences, which one seems worse to you? If you're from the developed part of the world, you might be inclined to say homeless with heart because obviously no one wants to be homeless. If you're from a developing nation somewhere out there, you might be more inclined to say heartless with home. Not to say all people from either ends of the socio-economic scale would elect those specific choices, but these choices are both lose/lose scenarios. There has to be a better way to lift everyone up and be successful at the same time. My only hope is that I live long enough to see when a super artificial intelligence is able to figure out most of the world's problems with relative ease. Humans have shown we are pretty good problem solvers, but we also make more problems than we solve; kind of a catch-22. If only my father were alive today, I would ask him what his thoughts were on the problems of today. He was always a lifelong Republican, had an amazing business savvy and was he the luckiest man I've ever known.
