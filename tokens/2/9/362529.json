An idea I was exploring on since early 2019 that is close to my heart. They started out as bronze sculptures but with the current pandemic, I am not even sure if the bronze mills are still operating in Thailand. So, I decided to go back to the very roots of pure drawing to continue with the topic. Also, to dwell deeper into the simplicity of drawing to find more clarity in my art practice. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWGgQ1X3DNa584wBPK84ogt9dvz87V7ohaXKwDxd83yV3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNchjr1tqnzdRt1kwa3pr37Gh8VhvVBYUuLusyf3FY72R", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWGgQ1X3DNa584wBPK84ogt9dvz87V7ohaXKwDxd83yV3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZPRhzE33xzYTbC1B2VndcvcTZiTd4JcS7"], "tags": ["graphite", "drawing", "contemporaryart", "graphiteonpaper"], "extra": {}}
