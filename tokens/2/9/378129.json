Of course it's also open, calm and cooperative, but they're in shorter supply, especially considering they're mixed with being disrespectful as well.\nIts sentimentality though, this is what it's pretty much known for. People often count on this and its loving nature whenever they need help.\nNobody's perfect of course and Chromatic Cactus has a share of darker sides to deal with too. Its pompous nature and superficial nature cause plenty of grievances, much to the annoyance of others. Fortunately its sweet nature helps lighten the blows and moods when needed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme9P48Abj6xtuQCQBUppisApufGcbtW1hEm9ZohjDEN83", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbzYWh8EekKNszx7guBxVVD8DUF13tbmweDm6bn8TKpjF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme9P48Abj6xtuQCQBUppisApufGcbtW1hEm9ZohjDEN83", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1W1gLrRXMLveTGmnDeG1ZrWRcwZLBWfWiG"], "tags": ["3D", "cactus", "cacti", "collection", "collectibles", "3Drender", "chromatic", "glass", "beautiful", "plant", "digitalart", ""], "extra": {}}
