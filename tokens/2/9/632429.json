And there's the other character with the pink hair, you can say its \"the-other-self\". The one that whispers thoughts. Sometimes its a darker thoughts.\n\nThe Main Character are affected by what The Other Character said, that she focused more on her mind and finally be able to properly communicat  with The Other Character.\n\nThe Other Character is not a villain. You can say its like that Inner Child we all have. It needs to be nurtured.\n\nSo that's the story of all this Mind Things.
