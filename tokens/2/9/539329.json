It is natural, but cultural values need to be preserved somewhere. I think NFT is well suited for this purpose.\n\nRather than focusing on a single piece of graffiti, I chose a photo of multiple pieces of graffiti that come together to form a single landscape.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWzktjGfB66PVeD5ZHtcaYWC3z6Ke3Z3okzHNb3RwtWDC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPy228M3fbRa6TLaUzjUhoVkmQpAYoPzfbNa5eMMLot7F", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWzktjGfB66PVeD5ZHtcaYWC3z6Ke3Z3okzHNb3RwtWDC", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NvmhEqecNG6qw53cNrBBtgAJAom4Haf7k"], "tags": ["tokyo", "street", "graffiti", "photography"], "extra": {}}
