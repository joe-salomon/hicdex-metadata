To me, words are the key to our soul. Without words we are blind. We can not express what we see. We can not explain what we hear. We can not communicate without words.  Words are the key to our soul.\n\nThese #NFTs are intended to be sold and NOT TO HOLD!  Read the #NFT message if you dare! \n\nBuy it and transfer it to others. Keep it moving until the end of time! \n\nThis project is about data #analytics to understand human behavior with regards to positive vs. negative #ChainLetterNFT messages.  Breaking the buy/hold mentality of NFTs to see positive vs. negative impacts of NFT #communities. \n\nThe first 1500 wallets that buy then sell these NFTs will get a free NFT airdrop for supporting this project.  \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaoFKwH6TMxr7Q346kAmDXdTw735RcQe6JF6r8QyCcG5a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaoFKwH6TMxr7Q346kAmDXdTw735RcQe6JF6r8QyCcG5a", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaoFKwH6TMxr7Q346kAmDXdTw735RcQe6JF6r8QyCcG5a", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Y6SsC3uwccxerYCFJcTk5EL7juLpWRKvD"], "tags": ["#Superstition", "#Fear", "#Cult", "#Paranoia", "#Guilt", "#Human_Behavior", "#Negative_Vibes", "#Death"], "extra": {}}
