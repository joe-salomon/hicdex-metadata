SPECIAL EDITION.", "description": "SPECIAL BONUS HOLOGRAM EDITION from \u201cNightmares\u201d collection.\nIt\u2019s a collection created to celebrate Halloween that revives the most common and darkest nightmares that haunt the human being. 8 collectible card amulets that explain the most terrifying fears and give protection to those who have them.\n\nDescription of the piece:\nIn a dream, cutting off someone's hands means having the desire to defy life, to defy everyone who can be an obstacle in our way. They are terrible dreams but they are not connected with physical death. We simply need to pay attention to work and relationships with other people. The meaning of the dream could also be about unfinished actions. \nDreaming that your hands are amputated or that you already have them amputated, means illness, emotional breakup and misfortunes. Be careful!\n\nMP4 - 1157x1600px\n\nFull story here: nft.matiasmarano.com/nightmares", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP9NqEWF2VVLgiy7wGvvE9cAdV9YSbvB5XZD5VDWqK1ML", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXyvJDixa1dUV54eCcevDCjV5HswuQvbDAbZ81mbSBN6h", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP9NqEWF2VVLgiy7wGvvE9cAdV9YSbvB5XZD5VDWqK1ML", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2NzvDGTtWUd195Yi5YewHXSY6mEwbmWjF4"], "tags": ["illustration", "halloween", "nightmares", "2d", "gore", "digitalillustration", "painting", "severed", "hand", "nfts", "collection", "paint", "blood", "tattoos", "matiasmarano", "card", "collectible", "hologram", "bonus", "special"], "extra": {}}
