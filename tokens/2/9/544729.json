We wanted to explore every alley (calle) and canal that was off the beaten path and hopefully catch a glimpse of how local Venetians went about their days.\n\nTHE VENETIAN SERIES is a photo-journal series of some of my favorite scenes from that unforgettable trip. The goal was to capture just a little piece of the indescribable feeling of being there and share it with friends and family.\n\nAll photos shot and edited directly on iPhone. All proceeds from the primary and secondary sales (15% royalty*) of this account will go towards supporting other photography artists on tezos platforms.\n\n*25% royalty on this edition only", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRFc72pwfRaFXKRyAeeLvYZn9BZ4oh1oNfN2KrPjL2iVv", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXRMsRDs19jmk9VEb9nDa38Ku8tredPaz8n3KmFpwTLRL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRFc72pwfRaFXKRyAeeLvYZn9BZ4oh1oNfN2KrPjL2iVv", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PnteNDBwzL2FY1ux5iBRFP42CUm6Reveo"], "tags": ["venice", "italy", "photography", "sunset", "canal", "cafe"], "extra": {}}
