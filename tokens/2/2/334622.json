My walls were collaged with jewel case cover art from my favorite bands and it\u2019s around that time that I started drawing these strange creatures. \n\nAs my work evolved over the years, the strange creatures were something I always came back to. A comfortable default. So in this new space for me as an artist, I think it\u2019s time to take a deeper dive into the strange creatures.\n\nSTRANGECREATURES 01 is a nostalgic callback to that simpler time for me. Let the punk wave wash over you.\n\n1620x2880", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSSReJkEtrHLUM7gKiF2QsfjSLxztpUKP5L43wYW7tRcf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSSReJkEtrHLUM7gKiF2QsfjSLxztpUKP5L43wYW7tRcf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSSReJkEtrHLUM7gKiF2QsfjSLxztpUKP5L43wYW7tRcf", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1bfkVqcsa36onbgAcp5HjYCfMPx1hsXATe"], "tags": ["strange", "creatures", "gif", "punk", "illustration", "grunge", "glitch"], "extra": {}}
