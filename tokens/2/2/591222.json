The 1/1 \"Hot Potato.\" NFT was supposed to be sent directly to friends' wallets; no swaps/sales necessary. We wanted to create a running list of wallets that held AND passed the tater. At the time of this writing, it's swapped to the marketplace. Funds from this sale this NFT \u2014 POTATO BAIL \u2014 will go to buy back the Hot Potato so that we can pass it freely to the next person via airdrop to keep the game going indefinitely.
