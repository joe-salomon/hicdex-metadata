This is my contemporary Goddess Hecate depiction with different personalities of women inside her. Always with an ancient dagger and smoking with cold glance.\n\n2921x3758 px\n\nHecate* or Hekate* is a goddess in ancient Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding a pair of torches or a key[1] and in later periods depicted in triple form. She is variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, night, light, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, necromancy, and sorcery.
