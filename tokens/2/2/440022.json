I fall asleep on the bed, and he smells like the street and a little drunken fun. I hear resentment in my voice. He, like a child, crawls under my side. He was offended that no one wanted to fight him on the street. Drunk and touchy. He called me Cat. Ridiculous and so similar.\nHugging me across and pressing against my thigh, he says:\n\n-you are my kitten ... I won't give you to anyone! - and with such a feeling that someone will really take me away.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWJYJvkx83D75mygZd6TvYWLg26EdEjXZ13fNWoxjjd4b", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmboG6yjy6Nz957GYypZwSWx6dQP4XsbshwFbxrhZgcMxo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWJYJvkx83D75mygZd6TvYWLg26EdEjXZ13fNWoxjjd4b", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2QXGq7JaryjriaoRBUD925xhBs6PuUVMSX"], "tags": ["illustration", "art", "comic", "paint", "artist", "love", "lovestory"], "extra": {}}
