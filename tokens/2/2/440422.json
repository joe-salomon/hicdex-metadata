After the War, Nuka-Cola is still popular, as large quantities of it were preserved. The classic Nuka-Cola taste is the result of combining seventeen different fruit essences with the classic cola tastes, enhancing, but not overwhelming it. By 2077, Nuka-Cola bottles take on a newer look akin to a rocket ship and advertising also follows suit with the reuse of the space-themed mascot: Nuka-Girl.\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQS4TMGUac3MdL1b2qWj3htVTjvuhQnTLtkYrxfioMWit", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcY2UfVeouKLRMEqF5oDM2cECxjaq4DZuBhV9brcNa32k", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQS4TMGUac3MdL1b2qWj3htVTjvuhQnTLtkYrxfioMWit", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Y45h6xg2y9WWHGZRszV35eSQgZQG927zG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dart", "3dartist", "3danimation", "3drender", "looping", "loop", "loopinggif", "Fallout", "nukacola", "bottlecap", "shrednector", "objkt4objkjt"], "extra": {}}
