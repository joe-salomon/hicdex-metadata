{"__version": 1, "token_id": 623222, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "CANYON ANYONE?", "description": "CANYON ANYONE is a syntax exploration experiment that pushes the narrative boundaries of minimalism. How much can we make with so little? From one word and 1 extra letter, can we successfully make something from nearly nothing? Do we choose CANYON + E or do we choose C+ ANYONE? Answer is either or both. What is the \"narrative\" here? We could assign a narrative here, but do we even need it? Can't the words just exist on their own as they do in real life? Could this translate into a larger work of art, like perhaps a sculpture stacked on top of one-another? If this is art, then couldn't anything be art? Was Duchamp correct in wanting to challenge the establishment from wanting to please the eye to please the mind? How is this challenging the status quo? Hasn't everything been done already? And if so, what makes good art and bad art? Do we, as artists, really need to know art history anymore? Is it relevant? Why is it so important to understand art history? (Hope you're taking notes...there's a quiz on page 335.)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVFcRk1wsuLxuQLvZBggM7LsHkCqXZkE6dHcQNoCcnJWa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmauQ7FvZKkGchysHMUueBv1X473xuZQG6DfEmU7Vn6SrT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVFcRk1wsuLxuQLvZBggM7LsHkCqXZkE6dHcQNoCcnJWa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
