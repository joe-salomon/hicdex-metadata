Generated by a hand-coded python application, this is the first objkt minted by @TheMaxBore. The Pessimist series is built on an instruction set that combines rectangles, ellipses, clipping paths, and fills to create geometric, conceptual, modern works that are structured in their composition, but organic in their rendition. All quantities, sizes, positions, and pallets are generated by the application. sol-lewitt-26359 was hand-coded to honor the style and pallet of the great artist and forefather of generative art. The art exists as an svg to preserve the integrity of the original and allow viewing and reproduction at any size.\n\nGenerative art created by MaxBore.\nOfficial wallet: maxbore.tez\nOfficial Twitter account: https://twitter.com/themaxbore", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTz6fWsFtsFkqwetscRJMRFX8ALHdGqVXrwFFt6xUes19", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcHJG7rxihZ7HpHEQApYRigx3djPW91S984Nq3kNDSHVX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTz6fWsFtsFkqwetscRJMRFX8ALHdGqVXrwFFt6xUes19", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1fZnsguzqqSryegHiirsUVnNJmJcqUbtWR"], "tags": ["sol", "lewitt", "sollewitt", "abstract", "abstractart", "algorithmicart", "art", "artoftheday", "codeart", "conceptualart", "contemporaryart", "creativecodeart", "design", "digitalart", "generativeart", "generativeartist", "generativearts", "generativeartstudio", "generativearttoys", "generativedesign", "geometricart", "graphicdesign", "mathart", "modernart", "nft", "proceduralart", "processart", "visualart", "MaxBore"], "extra": {}}
