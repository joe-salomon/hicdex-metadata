I had this sub-series called Band Names of Bands that Never Banded, that not only created fake band names, but gave them an entire backstory. It was a lot of fun and let's face it it's clear I'm a sucker for a good pun. This one plays on the old saying, \"taken for granted\" or to \"to accept without question or objection\"; to undervalue someone or situation in some way. This imaginary band had they ever banded would have been a hardcore band from Lancaster, PA during the height of the straight edge hardcore movement somewhere in the mid-90s. Their sound was cross between Sunny Day Real Estate and Drive Like Jehu. A typical 4 piece band (percussion, bass, lead guitar, a rhythm guitar) with lyrics rambling in and out of stereotypical early emo-core music.
