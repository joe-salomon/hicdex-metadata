Lucky Lucy van Delft", "description": "Just wanted to secure this on the blockchain. It's a culmination of what has always been important to me. It is terrifying to think of passing from this life and having all my artistic legacy ending up unappreciated in the trash or a thrift store (at best). One shouldn't have to be a commercial artist to be viable or have their legacy be viable. The intrinsic nature of being an artist is enough. In fact, commercialism only taints the true intended output of any creative person. One day collectors and museums will fawn over the purist artists and it's important to be united as a group to be able to be found at a later date. Our work needs to be archived into NFTs with smart contracts designating any future potential benefit to a worthy party, family or organization.\n\nthis direct message was sent to RADIOACTIVE 3D. (3D.ninja) because he built a next level project in The Uplift World, but ideally would love as many people as possible to get paid to help build this concept out. People could get paid for helping to mint traditional art into NFTs for non-technical traditional artists, or artists that have already died. Or get paid to help set up the smart contracts to make this happen. So many possibilities!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTsoYYdbQ7KyTJyorWFJFuupKCxQqez1tSuPaPFsff3G4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTsoYYdbQ7KyTJyorWFJFuupKCxQqez1tSuPaPFsff3G4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTsoYYdbQ7KyTJyorWFJFuupKCxQqez1tSuPaPFsff3G4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fziiZdiG4myWUoBNg4YqyFikWXs7WUjxE"], "tags": ["concept", "graveyard", "artists", "creative", "nfts", "nft", "bones", "bags", "lucy", "luckylucy", "delft"], "extra": {}}
