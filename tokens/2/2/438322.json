The air. The moon. \n\nSoon through spacetime to Mars. Further Beyond. \n\nHuman beings think and create to bridge themselves with other places, and to carry their lives and life to a new land & new time. \n\nIn which space ship or planet will this work be looked at in the future? By whom? By ai or human beings, or both?\n\nOriginal art by tomi with ai on 2021-10-16. \n\n3584\u200a\u00d7\u200a6400px\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma24KfgBKuSPBCYRjmetFqqF1T1B4fLfchGvWdgnKMnvf", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma24KfgBKuSPBCYRjmetFqqF1T1B4fLfchGvWdgnKMnvf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma24KfgBKuSPBCYRjmetFqqF1T1B4fLfchGvWdgnKMnvf", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Si9QC2RuiyPamLRZRjp9YcXXYCuPDm5BC"], "tags": ["ai", "gan", "generative", "generativeart", "life", "monochrome", "tomi", "2021", "art", "gif"], "extra": {}}
