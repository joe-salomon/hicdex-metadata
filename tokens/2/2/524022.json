It has amazing Southeast Asian charm, naturally beautiful without being too touristy. The rain this morning made taking photos though, so I ended up doing long exposures under a dock. I love that on a day when I thought there was no way to get a great image, I come away with a beautiful image and memory of a place that I love.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYUt4HshGx9iahMxJJWPAa4rT412qxXLAGRfEx8SxBTUm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVQmGKtzH913zGUG59oMT5s5D9wmKCLaEUhEVnA11iUJ9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYUt4HshGx9iahMxJJWPAa4rT412qxXLAGRfEx8SxBTUm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dT1cPF73Cc51o9pu9CCMiyz9AbmT71Fgs"], "tags": ["Pier", "Langkawi", "Malaysia", "rainyday"], "extra": {}}
