Unlike the exoticism of urbex, this series seeks to expose forgotten or ignored elements of our environment that are hidden in plain sight; to uncover the beauty in the mundane.\n \nThis series was born out of a desire to combat my depression, when even taking a walk seemed a Herculean undertaking. Passing through many of the same surroundings day after day I began to forge a connection with scenes and vignettes that were at first glance easy to pass over. In sharing these images, I hope to inspire a similar connection in others.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTtECi9niJZDDZVoLB3jAGYm8epXdiqyWCw1aJaKDRSev", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmc7X1yitN6UrEof4tSvypmwvEyYqVjPypK3F5ENtA1JPh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTtECi9niJZDDZVoLB3jAGYm8epXdiqyWCw1aJaKDRSev", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iabvFX2r61cz9wJ2NjUHyVVsyFYMB5kqN"], "tags": ["photo", "photography", "mundane", "urbex", "urban", "urbandecay", "decay"], "extra": {}}
