In the Space Restricted Artifacts series, the process of applying multiple lines to form a kind of topographical illusion is almost reversed, when the thickness of the line overwhelms the space between them. The focus becomes a way of depicting light and shadow, rather than topography. \n\nA human attempting to mimic a machine mimicking an organism and ending in purgatory.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeihmsm2y4r2qz7yarwfgbn2zs2umqbjnlm44h5ghnnlbsxfqxvemqi", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreifxbkbipcj6adi6iegmdbqq4zfj35m45pzqpmw7jvr4sb3e5bxu7u", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeihmsm2y4r2qz7yarwfgbn2zs2umqbjnlm44h5ghnnlbsxfqxvemqi", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gEFPNk2qHVtvp266tsCksoUByqGhboz65"], "tags": ["deleuze", "lines", "light", "shadow", "genart", "organic", "systems", "drawing", "blackandwhite", "monochrome", "texture", ""], "extra": {}}
