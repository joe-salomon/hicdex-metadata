The object is roughly around 1 cubic kilometer and the ground around the area of the object has been turned into the same material the object is comprised of. The water around the area of the crater has been completely vaporized and a deep hole of immeasureable depth can be found below. The hole appears to be channeling energy towards the cube at random intervals. Restricted access to the area is granted to researchers and expeditionists.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTfZixpipa6xgPLj7pbRRbSWeMg6q8scQNghPvwgiNzvj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQpSd7oTdahTqhYUosgpJdFyaNoXTbaavZErjsj3cgP6H", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTfZixpipa6xgPLj7pbRRbSWeMg6q8scQNghPvwgiNzvj", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1RzYNSdaxHqQVRtvpsdj5BYZGndmSf4niU"], "tags": ["cryptoartph", "nftasia", "collectibles", "nftcollectibles", "illustration", "fantasy", "animated", "animation"], "extra": {}}
