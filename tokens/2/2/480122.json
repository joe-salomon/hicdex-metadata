Ego Bucks send his fleet of Starbunnies to determine what sort of utility they offer.\n\nVideo NFTs, each unique and representing different cryptocoins. The soundtrack was developed especially for this series.\n\nThis is the short play version of the Tezos Edition with a one minute loop. A separate three minute long play edition is also available.\n\nI would like to take the opportunity to raise some money for charitable causes so some of the proceeds from the sale of this work will be donated. You can find out more on the charities page of my lunarbunnies.com website.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYDWiSro2bdfHVUjW7c1sWbzSxpMwiEbseULuPkWNrknC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX75Vov2BvuuGRpV26QLJzmf4yodrnkZV2J6TxX3ysyes", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYDWiSro2bdfHVUjW7c1sWbzSxpMwiEbseULuPkWNrknC", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Zg2bm2EdgdCDcekhX7hE9VU5CfFzcXaqM"], "tags": ["lunarbunnies", "trippy", "music", "bunny", "loop"], "extra": {}}
