Once burnt you will be sent a 1/1 Here and Now ticket (on certain dates listed below). If you know the artist making the ticket by now, great, if you don't, you'll just have to wait :)\n\n----\n\nKEY DATES: \n\n9-20th September: Reservations open for current ticket holders of Edition One and Two only with a max purchase of x3 coins. Visit the private discord for an early reservation form, or DM. \n\n15th- 20th September: Reservation form made available for non-ticket holders of past editions with a max purchase of one coin. Follow Beets and look out for the form on Sept 15th.
