Light crosses space, bounces, hits cells, impresses sensors, translates into numerical code, creating a magic that fixes our image forever in the instant.\nBut what happens when the recording device is a 3d scanner? We must move, let ourselves be explored slowly, inch by inch, open, bend, turn around, to show the hidden points, to reveal the interstices. 3D photography is a dynamic, empirical, unpredictable experience. A dance with light that relies on the imperfect intelligence of the device, which interprets, senses, reconstructs and puts together our fragmentary image based on algorithms, models and forecasts. And then you can try to stress the vehicle to try to catch it out, to open the way to the beauty of the error.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVhke1a9cZncEvjUakrrFew9PinqQqym3XTiPNebBgPt3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZkUtmFVn98xLuJmxd5mXyyUUWNTBEgiiDMAvA1ZJRbhe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVhke1a9cZncEvjUakrrFew9PinqQqym3XTiPNebBgPt3", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1amsgMaX2kYNLHMttB26Rf1EXmy5eJAwZG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dscan", "3dmodel", "3dportrait", "3dscanner", "glitch", "error", "AI", "artificialintelligence", "3dobject", "face", "woman"], "extra": {}}
