{"__version": 1, "token_id": 573122, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Image imperialism", "description": "Trevor Paglen (2014) refers to Harun Farocki as \u201cone of the first to notice that image-making machines and algorithms were poised to inaugurate a new visual regime. Instead of simply representing things in the world, the machines and their images were starting to \u201cdo\u201d things in the world\u201d, thus condemning the human eye to an anachronistic existence, \u201cmachines were starting to see for themselves\u201d. This new visual regime inaugurated by image-making machines and algorithms, described by Farocki is the current visual regime we inhabit that I call image imperialism. These machines and their images are already \u201cdoing\u201d a lot of things in the world, maybe too many. It\u2019s uncontroversial to suggest that images supplant reality. Joan Fontcuberta (2019) asserts that we are not interested in reality, we are interested in a reality mediated by screens. This mediated content is effectively infinite or, at least, impossible for a single human mind to process.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUJpy5znpJZ1yJLYif4arsU68KrZoJFqX18pjs8FzUbFE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeqFnvuziVgo4qMz7nq5Ftgj3C7VHFrd6dF5rWFEYHgo8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmUJpy5znpJZ1yJLYif4arsU68KrZoJFqX18pjs8FzUbFE"}], "creators": ["tz1cQe16CdsBZnGz4awrh4p3u1xK7o5QApd5"], "tags": [], "extra": {}}
