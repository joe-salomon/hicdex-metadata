During this epoch, fundamental changes in the social position of women happend. \nMany painters of this era, however, did not go along with this devaluation. Leonardo da Vinci's depictions of women in particular overcame this inequality. He painted them present, showing cleavage and skin, allowing them to look directly at the viewer judge. An erotic provocation in its time. His women are depicted as self-confident, formulate a pronounced personality with obstinacy, reason and intellect. You are an equal counterpart to the man. These women are aware of their sensual, beautiful charisma, which is not perceived as a contradiction.\nThis is exactly what my series of works \"modern portaits\" symbolizes. Body-conscious women, strong, intelligent, beautiful, they could be entrepreneurs, bosses or startup founders - without denying their feminine physicality. Both go in parallel without being mutually exclusive and are also much more exciting and exciting overall.\n\nAquarell\n\nChrista Winter shows her NFTs exclusive at KULTUR KIOSK\nwww.christa-winter.com\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUukZDdA518YxeagrR2s8zAaWWWAghXW8eUp7wufjoETD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaSUnTB4CwrqMWpRnMjQXo6kZWGqgdhQmBZZGa3x2tWJk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUukZDdA518YxeagrR2s8zAaWWWAghXW8eUp7wufjoETD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1StBVBGsVD37cn1y8rtEAX72gThB5LyDKK"], "tags": ["woman", "aquarell", "empowerment", "renaissance", "icons", "watercolor"], "extra": {}}
