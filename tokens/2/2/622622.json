I had no idea that a new adventure awaited me.\nWhen working with sprays, everything happens incredibly fast, it's always the maximum presence and inclusion, because I have a window of time until everything is dry.\nWhen I started working, I noticed that one of the paints has amazing properties. First, the paint is as thick as spaghetti and dries 10 times faster, it added too much thickener.\nHere I had to do the impossible, and I managed to do everything I could.\nIt's fun to discover new resources where familiar scenarios end.\n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2017, 80x80 cm, spray paint on canvas, 2901x2891 pix.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSgVWte2MJwMCQvmJgi85jM3aphEzgAttPYEyMJdE4iKt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYAFMt93Mz6Qwi12unEUg2HtZhEF1CzejdXM15AnY7G3z", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSgVWte2MJwMCQvmJgi85jM3aphEzgAttPYEyMJdE4iKt", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["Artwork", "green", "red", "facture", "painting", "original", "colorful", "cryptoartist", "Denysenko_art"], "extra": {}}
