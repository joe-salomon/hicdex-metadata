This was made with a combination of Ableton stock sounds, pads and synths/ virtual instruments from arturia/analog lab, and engineered in Logic Pro. I was going thru a lot from falling in love with someone i couldn't date at the time, dealing with repercussions from unrequited love of a former best-friend, and delusions and psychosis from weed. i'm proud to be able to continue my journey and reflect on how hard my journey was. 2021 taught me more than i could ever imagine about my internals and where i am headed to go. last piece of 2021.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdAZbEJYfR7Egqq89rQXpXKxyV4d8VomPy9fpBknbx8PW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQzW4SsFiHjcMgmuexVyGW3uWUKsfsiZnsDCr4oMooctr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmVEnnHrWdEDEhtmzDGLRyzxfTPaBmM2rBkpcQwXsL9mVJ", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdAZbEJYfR7Egqq89rQXpXKxyV4d8VomPy9fpBknbx8PW", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TLpwWw7hoiPcXAdeGPukwYEAFvgJphh8t"], "tags": ["music", "audio", "instrumental"], "extra": {}}
