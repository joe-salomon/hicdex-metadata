Was it heavy or only big? What did it had inside? How long have you been carrying it? Are you almost there?... mmhhmm... we'll never know. \n\n* Positos street is one of the most popular in Guanajuato, on the XVIIth century it was called \"Royal street\" because it was the only one in the area that you could walk by, the others around were meant for the transit of everything that had to do with what they called \"hacienda de beneficio (benefit estate/cattle/property)\" that among other things, it is a place were everything that is extracted from a mine is taken and processed. So all people moved around this street and it is said that the sidewalks were actually made for \"important people\" to walk by and \"regular people\" walked down... today filled with museums and on one of its corners you can find the historic and famous Alh\u00f3ndiga de Granaditas. imo one of the prettiest streets in town. *\n\n4752 x 3168\n4.35 mb", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qme5raiKkXZNxNnjdMZ8CR9LDeunyqwsq8hBXDnF7gki9L", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWXCNqaSrEPjVmSHjgzgmak6hJwbLTzsNXX43NRALDsvw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qme5raiKkXZNxNnjdMZ8CR9LDeunyqwsq8hBXDnF7gki9L", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hgdyB1cCRz1uLH5RNwrRcyHxxURibnG4G"], "tags": ["urban", "photography", "glitched", "objkt", "jpg", "glitchart", "cleannft", "hen500k", "hen500", "500k", "nftmex", "mexico", "urbanphotography", "nikon", "nikonmx", "glitch", "internet", "art", "pollbein"], "extra": {}}
