{"__version": 1, "token_id": 562625, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LOWLOWLOWL", "description": "This kind of looks like the WHOWHOWHOW work from page 73. LOW and OWL are anagrams of each other. It's all on how you view the word. Some moments it says LOW and other moments it reads OWL. And just like the earlier work, the words LOW and OWL are only 1 letter placement from one another. One word needs the \"L\" at the front and the other needs the \"L\" at the end. As we overlap the \"L\"'s, the words create a a confusing scenario where the reader will not know which word should have emphasis. We can gain context and/or understanding by asking the question: How am I supposed to read this? We also have lines of LOWLOWLOWL visually reversed on alternating lines of text, which adds to the chaotic stoicism of the work. The resulting effect becomes almost like a mantra or pattern of confusion.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbdqCRcBgQG92biMdAq3oogJPsNMj6sjDKhEtTMU5vHB1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaahsbToLsELFUTnyWD6Twffj163xHfYQsTYhxyjNPHEG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbdqCRcBgQG92biMdAq3oogJPsNMj6sjDKhEtTMU5vHB1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
