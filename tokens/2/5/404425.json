They are lonely beings who surely will fight to death if they find another individual of the same species. It seems harsh and not wise to preserve the species, but as reproduction is made by sporulation, keeping the individual alive is the ultimate goal to keep generations going.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTTkjpzXeTZ1Av4m2EZMCYZ7G3y9EKkbfvjVkfYtYtLY9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPJHCvmUi54yJgmwM1Qhdcxt2oWNq1S7EWfYPPWnuJ69d", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTTkjpzXeTZ1Av4m2EZMCYZ7G3y9EKkbfvjVkfYtYtLY9", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Ro3NdaGmfMq9jZNtMUQnWMmA1goKiXPSv"], "tags": ["Darwin", "Crypto", "Species", "Chimera"], "extra": {}}
