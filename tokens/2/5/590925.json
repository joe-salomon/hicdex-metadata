Instead of being a boring landscape painter most of the time, why don't I spend some time to draw some flowers to her? So I opened her beloved book of flowers and came over a flower picture from Braque. Voila, the Braque I haven't seen before. I chose some flowers from his picture and recreated this. Hope my wife may love it. \nAnd hope you, the stranger, will also like this gift too.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNiPFZXa8Yohg6ijPwL32VKxwF1U7zyHfv74ayUjUMtQu", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQKkT4PXHMtpgGjcahpxiidy4aeyBqLGiDGRkpx37cyFo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNiPFZXa8Yohg6ijPwL32VKxwF1U7zyHfv74ayUjUMtQu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eWmfJZPMorS6v7YQ2CqQebsMnVEJYz1Ez"], "tags": ["flowers", "love", "braque", "gift"], "extra": {}}
