Thalassophobia is different from aquaphobia, which is a fear of water itself.\n\nThalassophobia could also be caused by traumatic events. A childhood near-drowning experience, witnessing a shark attack, never learning to swim, or even being told scary stories of the ocean are just a few examples of possible events that could trigger thalassophobia.\n\nI hope this NFT can make the person with Thalassophobia want to go swim Under The Sea with me.\n\n@MyReceipt", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVAzYt9TwmwLKZgmUDc1Ui7zXsH8cwTMLP7KM8LHNXZYw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQ2ep8TSM4pQbB2Z4LAHCgdAriPoEKWVDwj3Vy7NYxDkc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVAzYt9TwmwLKZgmUDc1Ui7zXsH8cwTMLP7KM8LHNXZYw", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1feFH8UBVKEuefC1nFt3SX3brbn67vxRdL"], "tags": ["water", "ocean", "sea", "swim", "diving", "coral", ""], "extra": {}}
