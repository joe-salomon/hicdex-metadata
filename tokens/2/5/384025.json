This mode of transportation is available in various non-protocol roads in Jakarta and mainly serves as an alternative for short-distance rides.In this work, i imagine the future of bajaj as public transportation. But, yeah, future predictions have been proven wrong again and again. In my view, it is a pointless activity. What we are interested in, though, is the idea of possible futures and using them as tools to better understand the present and to discuss the kind of future people want, and of course, ones people don't want.
