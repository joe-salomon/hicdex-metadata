It is similar to Langsuir in other Southeast Asia regions. The Kuntilanak usually takes the form of a pregnant woman who is unable to give birth to a child. Alternatively, it is often described as a vampiric, vengeful female spirit. Another form of the Pontianak refers to the ghost or white lady of Southeast Asian folklore. This figure was also named after the province of Western Kalimantan region (Borneo).\n\nThe Pontianak is often depicted as a long-haired woman dressed in white, and it represents local variations of a vampire. The white lady lures in unsuspecting men to incite fear and enact revenge. Signs that a Pontianak is nearby include the sound of an infant crying and the smell of a decaying corpse or the plumeria flower.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSQCLXKtwPxMCfPrM8mod6Tfz4yXdWd2P6cT45JmnX12e", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdhbXXbUqT6NHFQ2Su1kmVWZSB6GDUZQWYfLHpLZiVTra", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSQCLXKtwPxMCfPrM8mod6Tfz4yXdWd2P6cT45JmnX12e", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bHHP84avG5yEdVS7o3Apd2C3y9V1yas1Z"], "tags": ["Ghost", "illustration", "digital", "kuntilanak"], "extra": {}}
