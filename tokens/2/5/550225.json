{"__version": 1, "token_id": 550225, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SATOR SQUARE", "description": "Word squares consists of a set of words written out in a square grid. It's made in such a way that the same words can be read both horizontally and vertically. Each square has a certain \"order\" (The number of words, which is equal to the number of letters in each word). This particular word square is an order 5. The most famous word square in the world, the Sator Square, is written in Latin. Besides meeting all the basic requirements of a regular word square, the Sator Square became well known because it is palindromic in nature; it can be read backwards and forwards. It's one of the rarest gems in the world of wordplay. I tried to make my own word squares, of which you'll see in the coming pages. The higher order of the word square is, the higher the difficulty gets. An order 3 square is relatively easier to create than an order 5 or order 7.
