The artist talk.\u2019 (HD, colour/sound, 20'20\", 2020).\n\n\u2018The Garden of The Forking Paths\u2019 is a fascinating 1941 short story by Borges suggesting multiverse quantum leaps or hypertext links. In this case, it references a non-location, a space between spaces, a multidimensional crossroads with all options open but urgent decisions to be made. The audioloop is taken from Brenda Lee\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, as a general apology towards all the wrong choices that brought us here.\n\nMinted as 2x 00'14\" loop.
