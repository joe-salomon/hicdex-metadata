I am so honored and grateful to be a part of the sacred #transcommunity and to be able to define what my #nonbinary #genders look like for me! As a loving reminder, I use they / them / theirs pronouns professionally and am fluid, contextual, and subjective with my he/she/they/ze/xe/ellx/etc. pronouns with friends and loved ones! \n\nSending out an immense amount of care & protection to our divine queer, transgender, and gender-expansive communities!!! \n.\nLimited edition of 100 by Edgar Fabi\u00e1n Fr\u00edas / @edgarfabianfrias | 720 x 720 | .mp4 | 2020.
