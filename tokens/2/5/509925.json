{"__version": 1, "token_id": 509925, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "sketch 500K", "description": "This piece was inspired by the aesthetics of another beautiful #HEN500K piece (OBJKT#503781 by mmepa) reinterpreted in an interactive/generative approach. This piece generates a series of pencil-like sketches that builds on top of itself, their movements governed by a set of rules which incorporates some randomness and noise, but invites (and ultimately requires) the interaction of the viewer in the creation of the eventual output. Interactivity, community, building on top of each other. Fitting themes in celebration of HEN reaching 500,000 OBJKTs.\n\nClick on the canvas to initiate a running hatch sketch at the cursor.
