The conditions that exist in many of these forests and ecosystems are also simply non-renewable\u201d (Old Growth Panel Strategic Review\u00a0, April 2020).\n\n\u201cPossible Forests\u201d is a seamless looping video that asks the viewer to imagine a future where \u201cnew\" old-growth forests develop in a utopian future where these ancient beings are left to thrive, rather than be harvested. A StyleGAN2 model was trained on over 3000 images of existing old growth on Vancouver Island, Canada and asked to create new possible images from growth that does not, but could potentially, exist. Audio was recorded from one such forest near Victoria, BC and laid over top.\n\nAll primary proceeds of this NFT will be donated to the fight for Fairy Creek, a battle to protect an irreplaceable old-growth watershed in unceded Pacheedaht and Ditidaht territories, some of the areas where the original images were from.
