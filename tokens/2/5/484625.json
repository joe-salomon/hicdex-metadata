{"__version": 1, "token_id": 484625, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "#07 Rohypnol", "description": "Rohypnol is a potent and fast-acting sedative and known as the \u201crape drug\u201d. The physical effects of the drug may be noticeable within twenty to thirty minutes after ingestion. Rohypnol causes drowsiness, confusion, impaired motor skills, dizziness, disinhibition, impaired judgment, and reduced levels of consciousness. You may look and act like someone who is drunk. Your speech may be slurred, and you may have difficulty walking, or you may be completely unconscious. On the other hand, one of the most disturbing effects of Rohypnol is that it can produce complete or partial amnesia (loss of memory) for the events that take place after it is ingested. This means that you may not be able to remember what you did - or what was done to you - while you are under the influence of the drug, which may be a significant period. This \u201camnesic\u201d effect is especially likely when Rohypnol is ingested with alcohol.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbxnQfP96E7hBwxTut3isESnJg5rqreJ2kQywfrZ4ffRX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbxnQfP96E7hBwxTut3isESnJg5rqreJ2kQywfrZ4ffRX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbxnQfP96E7hBwxTut3isESnJg5rqreJ2kQywfrZ4ffRX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1WRYzrb3SYYQWzrSrNscaR1Qees3fHGdok"], "tags": ["chemistry", "drugs", "collectible", "nft", "rohypnol"], "extra": {}}
