It is natural, but cultural values need to be preserved somewhere. I think NFT is well suited for this purpose.\n\nRather than focusing on a single piece of graffiti, I chose a photo of multiple pieces of graffiti that come together to form a single landscape.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma9fc4rNPTXmgj8z6qabrEBSEwu7a6HSSBJCzMX9BKPWd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfSfK8aLNEKwQeQJtShDwrQMh4wgzWnXhaFYDKQted4G7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma9fc4rNPTXmgj8z6qabrEBSEwu7a6HSSBJCzMX9BKPWd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NvmhEqecNG6qw53cNrBBtgAJAom4Haf7k"], "tags": ["tokyo", "street", "graffiti", "photography"], "extra": {}}
