The most comfortable waterbed ever made is now FREE!\n\nWe're changing to single beds, so no longer have need or space for this queen bed.\n\nYou fill several plastic tubes as full as is needed for each individual's desired firmness (extra tubes included).\n\nThen place the tubes in the water-proof plastic foundation which is supported by a metal frame with nine 8\" legs supporting it. Then pull the pillow-top mattress over the foundation.\nOf course one person alone could enjoy the comfort of this bed, but two sleep without movements disturbing the other.\n\nTry out the bed before you buy! You'll enjoy its comfort for years to come!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNm5x4sMR1k8AW9L2g4XsKNrTmZfWYesJ7Y214LGZufYL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNm5x4sMR1k8AW9L2g4XsKNrTmZfWYesJ7Y214LGZufYL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNm5x4sMR1k8AW9L2g4XsKNrTmZfWYesJ7Y214LGZufYL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1efdGLEg5QWhi6cwAMYGZZE2Vp9s89QSJs"], "tags": ["trash", "photography", "craigslist", "minneapolis", "mattress", "waterbed", "comfortable", "52"], "extra": {}}
