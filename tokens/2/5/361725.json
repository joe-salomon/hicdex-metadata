Each time they seem different. And this otherness probably results from the fact that it changes us in time and we look at the world differently. The mountains provoke us to reflect on our lives, on the world that surrounds us, on passing time and on the beauty that we observe there. Over the years, I have met several people in the Tatra Mountains who went there for the first time, at the time of some significant crisis in their lives. Each of these people said that the Tatras had changed their lives. They forced them to think, required above average effort, gave them a thrill of adrenaline, gave them a positive attitude and allowed them to give life a new meaning. I often tell my friends that a trip to the Tatra Mountains is a kind of positive therapy for our mind.
