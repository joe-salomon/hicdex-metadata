It's a literal interpretation of the saying \"drawing a line in the sand\". In this case, I drew a line in the words THE SAND. It's a tongue-in-cheek art joke using language. I'm sure Richard Prince, the originator of joke art painting back in the 1980's, would either love this or absolutely hate it. Hard to say, considering it's just me talking to myself, but hey a conceptual artist can dream right? I love the meta quality of using itself to define itself, which draws you back to the title and then back to the work and then back to the title, etc. Hope you enjoy it as much as I loved making it. I'm sure art critics will just destroy this one as overly simplistic pedantic dribble. Only time will tell. Either way we move on to the next page!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR8tgZhpXP5354FUd87iAJYQTACXYcUEnowNVVxsg5TdV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdveyHX7DhkDRKuC95PTE65NLFPhVsUrcJRRibJWfsknd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR8tgZhpXP5354FUd87iAJYQTACXYcUEnowNVVxsg5TdV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
