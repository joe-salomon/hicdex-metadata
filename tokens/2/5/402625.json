Through the 90s, contact juggling received widespread attention, many people honing the act and performing it themselves. Despite the name \u201cjuggling\u201d, the balls are never really juggled in the air since the person juggling never actually releases them. These objects, usually glass balls, appear to effortlessly glide across the hands, arms and shoulder of the person juggling with them. Some of the widely used movements include palm rolling, head rolling and isolation. Seasoned contact jugglers can balance the balls on their fingertips and can even make the object appear to be defying gravity while attached to a part of their hand or arm.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmacXVP5q23wDY8N4D9FS9obLkSzjUuiKrNNfiaAVZoHqT", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmd4Gi7tRfZ2jPmnknGti54KKv9Qkdud9x3D6FjuiBeq2S", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmacXVP5q23wDY8N4D9FS9obLkSzjUuiKrNNfiaAVZoHqT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1USXnF3JhDpzqL6iN11q8HPkjow9uUsMqj"], "tags": ["singapore", "asia", "photojournalism", "japan", "contactjuggler", "ancient", "culture"], "extra": {}}
