After Christianization, it was identified with the devil. It is often said in Hungarian mythology that God had help from \u00d6rd\u00f6g when creating the world.\n\n\u00d6rd\u00f6g is often thought to look somewhat like a satyr or faun, a humanoid with the upper torso of a human male and lower portions of a goat; usually pitch-black, with cloven hooves, ram-like horns, a long tail ending in a blade; and he carries a pitchfork. He can also be distinguished by his overly large phallus.\n\nSource: Wikipedia", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfCgxC4pGs4CCibWR9E9DeBy2PoLChoYGD4kmoW3xGPn4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfCM9coLZgksft7j7KLfeV4kprgEyJ7VmB5A5wcpKHZRB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfCgxC4pGs4CCibWR9E9DeBy2PoLChoYGD4kmoW3xGPn4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1fdyejDESzzH8wiVq6WBBJnfyPdCN5xBjn"], "tags": ["digital", "collectible", "monsters", "mythological", "mythology", "animation", "card"], "extra": {}}
