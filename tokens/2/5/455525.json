In relation to the Day of the Dead we see drawings of catrinas, children who dress like these or who write the famous skulls to make fun of some character and, of course, death. Also with globalization there are many festivals and customs that end up being adopted in countries that have little or nothing to do with their origin. Thus, a mixture between two cultures is observed, such as the Day of the Dead and Halloween. Halloween parties, common in some parts of the world, are for many just a pretext to go to a party and dress up as any character. To put on a mask, paint your face, buy a costume or do it yourself.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcaqH68b2hGyUs77nrgP9hdNQFuVM7Ajs5j6ycSTZmFom", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQXtNDRTSmrRfuPToBH9CL5DzUrAmpXDg2k1DgGLt5N89", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcaqH68b2hGyUs77nrgP9hdNQFuVM7Ajs5j6ycSTZmFom", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R4Q8g7vx5EXGysLkWridBqnbjJXikMYSu"], "tags": ["catrina", "catrin", "portrait", "photography", "Mexico", "skull"], "extra": {}}
