As we age, we change the way we interact with it. Starting as babies, with little comprehension on anything. Ending, hopefully, with enough memory that all we see is tied to the past in some memory- consuming what is with what was. And then when we die, the memory dispersed in death. Where we are without biological memory or senses at all.
