I wish everyone could experience this mental exercise as the more you go out of your comfort zone, the better version of yourself you become. This is what I'd like to remember the viewer with this creation.\n\n\n \"I believe in clean NFTs and love the Tezos community.\"\n\n\nMichel Bertrand\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/michelabstract\n\nThis artwork is a PNG file measuring 2000 x 2000 pixels", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVZRmEcrwTWfzhwE6cXVBd8W6buZE1uXwRAxzGfVAwfpr", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma2o8Wba4oBL2Am6okWfW9TMeRcj78zhSoYuq2geE72gs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVZRmEcrwTWfzhwE6cXVBd8W6buZE1uXwRAxzGfVAwfpr", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VTxzdrte7XSRTN4N22nTqXUU3QXx3MqLh"], "tags": ["abstract", "abstract_art", "abstractart", "abstracted", "abstractexpressionism", "abstractexpressionist", "abstractpainting", "abstracts", "contemporaryart", "contemporaryartist", "contemporarypainting", "digitalart", "modernart", "paint", "https://twitter.com/michelabstract"], "extra": {}}
