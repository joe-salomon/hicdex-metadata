It was made entirely from a single photo of my shadow.  Mixed digital and analog processes were used, with an experimental approach - such as printing, cropping and torning, distorting in scanner, and digital manipulation. This is an intuitive expression of themes such as self-perception, dualities, projections and psychological pain. \n\nThis work was done a few years ago and is very personal, so I was a little reluctant to share.But at the same time it's one of the works I'm most proud of, so I decided to post it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV3UgKSRU1Ce4pMXse6bwzUUtRRzgVuGap2L5ArKBX3CC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRxa93sZQGqrYReBkHf2S7KD7dFwnAimFXcVsRxNNfh92", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV3UgKSRU1Ce4pMXse6bwzUUtRRzgVuGap2L5ArKBX3CC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1XN8V2Li1oMQwJUCb2HCGx4FhA54UyPEFN"], "tags": ["digital", "duality", "experimental", "photography", "analog", "negative", "scanner", "mentalhealth", "shadow"], "extra": {}}
