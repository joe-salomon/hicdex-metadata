{"__version": 1, "token_id": 630525, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "DEVIL WEARS VILE", "description": "Devil is one of those special, strange words that has a myriad of potential for wordplay on a variety of levels; anagram, palindrome, and anadrome to name a few. As well as these forms of wordplay, we can begin to create an abstract narrative just from the word DEVIL itself. If we examine the letters of the words, the building blocks of all communication, we discover that we can manipulate and influence the narrative by creating form and structure. And within this new found form and structure we can make indirect and sometimes direct callbacks to certain concepts, ideas, inspirations, etc. In this case, DEVIL WEARS VILE was inspired by was the film 'Devil Wears Prada'. The word DEVIL is made into a combination of a word pyramid, concrete poetry, and an anagram that forms into the shape of a woman's high-heel shoe. As the old saying goes, 'the devil is in the details'.
