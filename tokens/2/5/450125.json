There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything. There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra, let alone you. Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught. Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away, but even if we survive the collapse of our sun, we will not survive forever.\n\nMert Ozkaner, 2021\nTIFF: 50x50cm 300 dpi", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTdAnP1zJKYX44M7CYNcsb6LP677zuZxgX4cnoot8bRPL", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf9XYv8DhormSVvFa6xUiyqrHNUyrfqmCfaZRSpg2HUNA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTdAnP1zJKYX44M7CYNcsb6LP677zuZxgX4cnoot8bRPL", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ReArtb9pkK43BpxnAw6QnRDsRe6r54wZt"], "tags": ["art", "illustration", "digitalart", "abstract", "geometric", "algae", "ocean", "sea", "hicetnunc2000", "hiceturco2", "objkt4objkt", "mxrtozkxnerart", "illustration", "digitalart", "abstract", "geometric", "algae", "ocean", "sea", "hicetnunc2000", "hiceturco2", "objkt4objkt", "mxrtozkxner"], "extra": {}}
