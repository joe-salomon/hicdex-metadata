This was all so confusing, the place what once powered her heart, vanished in the abiss of memories.\nAs the time passed, a light reappeared in this beatiful movement. Probably it will never be the same, but we are here all together feeding this light.\n\nWith this NFT I want to say thank you to all the people that made this journey so beautiful and special!\nThanks to the people that are keeping HEN alive!\nAnd a special thanks to the creator and inventor of all of this, Rafael you created something very special! With my biggest respect I can only say thank you!\n\n///HEN Community Thank You Token///\n\n3D Sculpting | Animation | Rendering | Hair Simulation | mp4 loop 1200x1200px | SELFMADE MUSIC\n\nVisualArtist: sirgulliver.art\nMusicArtist: anna.bagniata\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWhH6RnSk9HiwudxfRdvJpWb1Q8TKxjYvF7FZp35aMr2u", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSj1NDh5tyjGghsqmGXovaA7Hpzy1TrCXmTqgsRiS5SNS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWhH6RnSk9HiwudxfRdvJpWb1Q8TKxjYvF7FZp35aMr2u", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1WuoiDA76GQo1zXnkSTYs27iHhJsLFvo44"], "tags": ["HEN", "Ludmilla", "Primate", "ElGolilla", "sirgulliver.art", "art", "sound", "cryptoape", "3d", "character", "animation", "cryptoape", "primate", "simulation", "techno", "fur", "music", "electronic", "hair", "heartbeat", "heart", "beat", "red", "light", "dust", "sad", ""], "extra": {}}
