I know it's not exactly as festive as usual Christmas themes, but lately when I think about Christmas all that pops up in my head is how everything seems to be moving so fast and how I want it to all slow down even for just a bit. How I've grown old and numb to even feel the festivity in the air because I've been jaded by bad experiences. I know a lot of people may be able to relate, but growing old just really sucks sometimes.\n\nIf I could, I would have forever covered the eyes of my innocent self so that I wouldn't be exposed to the pains of this world that has now blinded me.\n\nThe title is translated to mean \"A wish upon a star\" because I remember thinking of shooting stars and comparing them to the star on top of a Christmas tree and wondering if I could wish upon it to relieve me of my pain.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQqsqzPMg1gCt7AwYswhyjujBRyuSGR79wnYgUG9hcxk9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPbFsafXHCCKfM5di1wbieKmkM5Po2UczvZoUaLAp393B", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/png", "uri": "ipfs://QmQqsqzPMg1gCt7AwYswhyjujBRyuSGR79wnYgUG9hcxk9"}], "creators": ["tz1cahW4TVbYZQ1WCzDFiXr8PcGQcvCWcpa9"], "tags": ["christmas", "tezmas"], "extra": {}}
