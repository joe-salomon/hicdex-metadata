Just like NFTs have their origin in cryptocurrency, gold too has its origins as a currency. More importantly today, gold occupies a very central role in the functioning of internet infrastructure & the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn terms of the material qualities of the \u201cmetaverse\u201d, there is no cloud, cyberspace or Ethereum Virtual Machine without hardware made from materials like gold, extracted from mineral deposits in the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\nThe location of the NFT space is somewhat of a non-space. Even so, it has to exist somewhere within the limits of physical space. Is it an underground place where the technology is from or is it a place in the skies that we associate it with?\n\nProbably somewhere in between.\n\nThis piece was inspired by the sculptures of Richard Long, the NFT Crystals of FVCKRENDER, the imagining of digitality in terms of architecture by markdorf.tez & the gold-tinted vistas of pristine wilderness by the Hudson River School painters.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRt8CeUYRhSyH8ubsL4LrhNZCcGrPaSmeTsPAiULufQkR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbZfoPJ7a4biEMBn43UDJrzbfJTB6PLp6ByjzTJL428ee", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRt8CeUYRhSyH8ubsL4LrhNZCcGrPaSmeTsPAiULufQkR", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1g5GtyBrzjFdtsh6C8cKeXw6wRG5BeyWME"], "tags": ["gold", "origins", "\u039e", "cloud", "ontology", ""], "extra": {}}
