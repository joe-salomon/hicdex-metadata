It happened when I was 7 and it took me years to comprehend what actually happened. When I was 21 I finally told my mother about it.Even now, more than a decade later, I still can't fathom why it happened to me. \n\nI am not the only one. 1 in 3 women globally experience domestic abuse, sexual or physical assault in their lifetime.\n\nListen to your daughter, your sister, your mother and the women around you. Help them cut their ties.\n\nAudio: @tingkahlagu", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdsT3EfgEcEWSVmkuBaEmvGSp9r3rAGXBKSTKhYfz8H6L", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfNPRo1up8tabbmzcSE9usciQ3KLxiVeJEGxCHibfLBt6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdsT3EfgEcEWSVmkuBaEmvGSp9r3rAGXBKSTKhYfz8H6L", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1QHYQ19QqY7pUUPWZMjBRpy8VmoH3Qq4zK"], "tags": ["1/1", ""], "extra": {}}
