I keep those scraps thinking that they will be useful in the future, sometimes I give them to my partner for her own collage making, and sometimes I also turn them into recycled papers.\n\nI scanned those scraps and with Blender, I started to turn them into a series of 3D compositions. The composition of those unglued scraps becomes a collage by itself. This exploration with 3D format provides me with even more possibilities in collage making for my own progress as an artist.\n\nYou can see my collages on feransis.com or instagram @tuhanzilla.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcA8hqZ9ASCVjTas2eYACucFcz7bgTALjvTgHuhKvq7Ty", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma323SAx2RgEz2iif9nuje6gdf79M6WT2fEzZE9adU9XA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcA8hqZ9ASCVjTas2eYACucFcz7bgTALjvTgHuhKvq7Ty", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1av3PU2PNW6WxHVZuVSAwjbySs7McRLEFB"], "tags": ["analogcollage", "3d", "leftover", "jurnalkolasefrnss", "photoshop", "scraps", "collage", "blender"], "extra": {}}
