{"__version": 1, "token_id": 521325, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Shadow Bagong", "description": "Bagong was created from the shadow of Semar. Shadow Bagong, however, was created out of Bagong's own shadow.\n\nDuring his long life, Bagong has always been a critic. He speaks the voice of the forgotten. The roots, the dirts, even the ever loyal Abdhi Dalem. Allowing their voices to be heard in the hall of Lords and Kings. Wisest kings of old listened to his rant. And prosperous their kingdom be. But alas, not all kings bear the weight of their crown. Upon the reign of such king, Bagong is villainized, persecuted, exiled, locked in dungeons where sun don't shine. But the voice of the people is not to be silenced. The darkness that is part of him seeped through the cracks on the wall. Gathering crowds, whispering ideas, kindling the fire of revolution in the hearts of the people. Witnessing as the tides turn and kingdoms burn in the hands of its own people.\n\nShadow Bagong speaks words that Bagong was not allowed to say. They spoke in dark corners rather than halls, in stinking taverns rather than royal tables. But the words they spoke, oh the words they spoke.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTMcwWb3NhkvSxXAPaz7FDkrLMAptiWsR6Pkw8WfE6FHx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTfnAmZGfKVaFothGmysMC2wH2WZmFjibWMi6y9AHDhjY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTMcwWb3NhkvSxXAPaz7FDkrLMAptiWsR6Pkw8WfE6FHx", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2W9XBTTD9eYPnGTmJK9sWVKFojDPuCRKZL"], "tags": ["Bagong", "shadowbagong", "wayang", "darkness", "comic", "teaterkoma", "jester", "punakawan", "rememberrememberthe5thofnovember", "hen500k"], "extra": {}}
