I do love creative writings and this is \"KREMATORYO\" or crematorium, my first ever EP.  It was officially out on youtube last August 29, 2021. It was so much fun and challenging because this is a solo man project from searching beats, writing verses, recording, mixing and even the E.P. Art cover. This is so meaningful to me, creating this was like helping myself achieve emotional freedom. Why Crematorium? That's a challenge for you to seek the answers. \n\nYou can check it out on my YT: Vilton Sabino. Thank you so much.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcvz8CB4FHPFue1bzWXHC1GTUX7NR8aqWN1D9aDzRAm71", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfHtWJckr4xRdbaPsa4LjvdD3DRqzLRdeoR3giMBC5tmX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcvz8CB4FHPFue1bzWXHC1GTUX7NR8aqWN1D9aDzRAm71", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1aTwFo2UU44U7C2M7yJb11zbEtCJBMfaGQ"], "tags": ["Digitalart", "ep", "rap", "epcover", "song", "poem", "life", "dreams", "inspirational", "dark", "beat", "poet", "vilton", "nftasia", "nftphilippines", "self"], "extra": {}}
