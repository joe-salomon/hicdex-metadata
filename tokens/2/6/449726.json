{"__version": 1, "token_id": 449726, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "LUCY0001 - My old machine says \"hello\" ", "description": "Lucy is an independent and generative automaton developed in MAX to compose audiovisual pieces in their entirety, creating music and a video synthesis reactive to sound, using pre-set mathematical parameters and patches that allow the insertion of variants to drive the piece out of scope purely random.\n\nEach piece in this collection will be created through an automaton generated from its predecessor, with 35%-45% restructuring of its code at each new generation. The pieces will last from 1 to 7 minutes due to the BPM variation and the use of 'Elastic Audio'. Each work will have only one copy that accompanies a GIF animation generated exclusively for it using the MAX patch. The first buyer can opt to receive the full version of the same animation, which must be sent separately by another platform as the file is too big for hicetnunc.\n\n\nFormat: MP4 SONY XAVC LONG\nResolution: 1920p x 1080p\nData rate (video): 49210 kbps\nBit rate (video): 50727kbps\nFrames: 29.97fps\nSampling rate (audio): 48kHz 24-bit\nBit rate (audio): 1519 kbps", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcsGnXM2BafkxhqxzDxuomBVAmmP1nZJ8VgutTRBRwcLj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVwkwC9uXqi5unvVvV3t3ZRa7utRChqafHBo9GoE2eXz7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcsGnXM2BafkxhqxzDxuomBVAmmP1nZJ8VgutTRBRwcLj", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1Tp8PHdx2KsvHyVWb4NaGev8wXLk1HwqCw"], "tags": ["cleannft", "generativemusic", "generativeart", "coding", "MAX", "collection", "unique", "MP4", "WAV"], "extra": {}}
