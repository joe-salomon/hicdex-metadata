A chill place where travelers can take some time to rest by the beach or eat some of Island_ 01\u2019s famous hot dogs!\nShips often also come to drop of cargo or for their routine ship maintenance. This island is powered by a huge wind turbine in the center of it. Any extra energy it produces is used to fuel ships that stop by and is also transported to other islands in need.\n\n- Port Island_01 is part 1 of the Port Island series\n\n2048x2048 pixel .gif", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmek9L5xT1DwGzU3QAHhsHmkuGQurEBEQpwZZUxBbVznmf", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmek9L5xT1DwGzU3QAHhsHmkuGQurEBEQpwZZUxBbVznmf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmek9L5xT1DwGzU3QAHhsHmkuGQurEBEQpwZZUxBbVznmf", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1NNm1PE1WuBQE5F1qhqcvPFHiQWppFmNH8"], "tags": ["illustration", "animated", "details", "island", "ship", "technology", "hotdogs"], "extra": {}}
