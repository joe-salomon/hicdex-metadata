{"__version": 1, "token_id": 372226, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Color wave", "description": "Our brain has a large number of nerve cells called neurons, and each neuron connects to thousands of other neurons. The function of the brain is to communicate with other parts of the body by these cells and their nerve messages. Communication between them occurs through small electric currents. Which travel along neurons and in massive networks of brain circuits. The nature of these neural messages is electrical current and a neurotransmitter between two cells. The electrical activity of neurons causes the formation of brain waves that have different frequencies with different efficiencies in different states.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmchRK331gCy7eg6myLxJ6XoLGj7qquLKw1b626iaSpXK6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWfZC69AjcCQdiyJdY3ky9Jk7R6GVGhhcUHsFeNcc4Dxq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmchRK331gCy7eg6myLxJ6XoLGj7qquLKw1b626iaSpXK6", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1bRfYU1PkghFqyFEtWHz5vLPZBpLUuPQ2h"], "tags": ["2d", "Artist", "animation", "abstract", "digital", "illustration", "conceptart", "painting", "contemporaryart", "color", "colorful", "wave", ""], "extra": {}}
