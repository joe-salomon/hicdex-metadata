I was heavily inspired by Max Capacity's dos_punks to see if I could create something similar on the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. I had a ton of fun making this, and I hope you have a ton of fun looking through the generated space. If you like it, please let me know on Twitter @aebrer :)\n\nSome notes:\n- All the features are programmatically generated... as in, there are no images. It's all procedural. Everything is made by stacking the Pico-8's characters over and over. Nothing but text is being displayed on the screen.\n- If you have synced your wallet, the generator will start you off on the custom pico_punk that is based on your wallet address seed.\n- There are some rare combinations and features, for example, a 1/1000 rainbow mode.\n\nControls:\n\n- Left/Right    -> -/+ 1 seed\n- Down/Up       -> -/+ 10 seeds\n- Circle Button -> Random Seed\n- X Button      -> Save a downloadable image.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU2otpRpMrMGTjE4dC2GDk6VtJyJcqgRQCfQsWQ7BoTi9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVDaLWWCfGYAuCZSaTaqSqxzdheHcCH6WXUuTABwETjGd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU2otpRpMrMGTjE4dC2GDk6VtJyJcqgRQCfQsWQ7BoTi9", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1ZBMhTa7gxSpaeXoqyc6bTCrxEHfZYSpPt"], "tags": ["pfp", "avatar", "generative", "collectible", "generator", "pico-8", "pico8", "interactive", "creativecoding", "pixelart", "punks"], "extra": {}}
