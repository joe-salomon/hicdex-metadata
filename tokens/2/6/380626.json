The children looked posed and a bit confused as their pregnant mother hides her face from the photographer.\n\nThe caption read: \u201cA big \u2018For Sale\u2019 sign in a Chicago yard mutely tells the tragic story of Mr. and Mrs. Ray Chalifoux, who face eviction from their apartment. With no place to turn, the jobless coal truck driver and his wife decide to sell their four children. Mrs. Lucille Chalifoux turns her head from the camera above while her children stare wonderingly. On the top step are Lana, 6, and Rae, 5. Below are Milton, 4, and Sue Ellen, 2\u201d.\n\nFamily members accused the mother of being paid to stage the photo, which may have been part of the story, but unfortunately, she was dead serious about selling her children. Within two years all of the children\u2019s pictures, as well as the baby she was carrying at the time, were sold off to different homes.\n\nRaeAnn Mills and her brother Milton were sold to the Zoeteman family on August 27, 1950. Their names were changed to Beverly and Kenneth, and although their birth mother\u2019s situation was dire, their new home wasn\u2019t much of salvation.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZJXnqBNWjELsSLzTuNmNctv4vskboGwpWhJufiGDqGsg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdzospLeXNcWB5kckAmg6UUZ1X4JKSnBiytizJJRnB8ZK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZJXnqBNWjELsSLzTuNmNctv4vskboGwpWhJufiGDqGsg", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hWWZGzwLCvA1BZEoKFNWe9LyxWrk6iaHy"], "tags": ["historical", "photos", "rare", "nft", "1948", "family", "children", "forsale", "Chicago", "Indiana", "time", "history", "collector", "xtz", "tezos", "hicetnunc"], "extra": {}}
