My works have not been published on any NFT site. Hen is the first site where I publish NFT.\n\nThis illustration was based on the spirit of the small Argentine towns in the 60\u00b4.\nWhen a golden haze covered the nostalgia. When life was so simple than music on an old instrument.\nAnd a cat on the wall with its simplicity were enough to consider us rich.\nThis is how my grandparents thought, this is how I hope I have captured that spirit in this work.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeib6zisodxzy3ji2zcbxolkfp2evxuwtvzbu67uiondkcfj2kjauyq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreibjqnacxesddfh7fpzurszo2gz5r463rnbvql5ynrvvtxf3viaio4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeib6zisodxzy3ji2zcbxolkfp2evxuwtvzbu67uiondkcfj2kjauyq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZryT4fmy97uV39Vq8VbSNmtqstUgLXiTq"], "tags": ["illustration", "traditional", "acrylic", "2DArt", "oldtimes", "oleo", "watercolour", "drawing", "art", "objkt4objkt"], "extra": {}}
