Their molten bodies manifest as stone inorder to safely touch each other.  The title of this piece is another way to say \"I love you\". \n\nImage description: Pen and ink drawing by Marc Ngui with digital collage coloring - image says, \"I Like My Odds in Your Scenario\" and shows two figures made of orange, molten lava floating in space, wearing concrete oven mitts and surrounded by cubist cartoon creatures against an electronic grid pattern.\n\nI Like My Odds in Your Scenario is the 6th NFT in the  MemeSwarm Redux 2021 collection\n\n>>> About Meme Swarm Redux 2021 <<<\nThese psychedoodlic haikus were created for a group exhibit called Gene Swarm curated by Rupert Bottenberg and held at Le Kop Shop, Montreal, Canada, during November 2006. The participants were Luke Ramsey, Billy Mavreas, Rupert Bottenberg and Marc Ngui.\n\n<<< Semantic Background >>>\n\nGene Swarm is a term gleaned from one of Terence Mckenna's many monologues. It refers to the flow of genetic information on the earth over millennia as it would be perceived by a consciousness capable of observing events unfolding over extremely long time scales.\nMckenna's point was that individual species (nevermind individuals) would exist only as flickers of flesh while the genetic information would be the continuous elements combining and recombining, dancing each other in and out of prominence as environments changed and evolutionary forces selected the most appropriate combinations. This idea of observing evolution at a bio-molecular level over geologic time seems to have been impossible until the 20th century.\nThe title Meme Swarm was generated when gene was switched to meme as a way of emphasizing information content over biological processes.\n\n>>> About the Creation Process <<<\n\nEach image was first drawn with ink on paper, scanned at a high resolution and digitally coloured and collaged. Many images use classical and famous paintings as backgrounds and these are noted below. Other elements used include personal photographs and images gleaned off the web, also noted below, and patterns and textures generated specifically for this project.\nThey have been remastered and generally improved for their NFT debut.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTfRteFwHyLRdTz9gETkoKiaFoasvRuHUx4hYV4Su9PdW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbXHoogx6s4jWcBjvtBqNLzqAmD82dTARbmFj6gs2wBd3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTfRteFwHyLRdTz9gETkoKiaFoasvRuHUx4hYV4Su9PdW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1NTY6Prmq4er4RXkGSwGCfjUjkfgyTMR67"], "tags": ["lava", "bodies", "touch", "blocks", "grids", "space", "cosmos", "dimensions", "flying", "selfrealization", "comics", "psychedelic", "handlettering", "memeswarmredux2021", "marcngui", "drawing", "penandink", "digitalcolour", "collage", "psychedelic"], "extra": {}}
