He is brave and smart, but can also be very petty and a bit judgemental.\n \nHe is currently single and defines himself as pansexual. His most recent romance was with a ventriloquist named Pete. They broke up because Pete couldn't cope with Nomi's illegal activity of giving unsolicited art museum tours.\n \nNomi's best friend is a trans-woman named Edna who is a then-cleaner-turns-into-bookshop owner. They are inseparable and enjoy making dumplings together.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbBhH7RUTkXUE2pUGTfbN6A5Q9UrNswSyGk8zWTv83PBy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXqLKc6sKZAGVLptPKqU4djwW4MrVWf4iDoppee8cWmYC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbBhH7RUTkXUE2pUGTfbN6A5Q9UrNswSyGk8zWTv83PBy", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hHrWwmWDbBhyoigpkCDfDTWPHPqwUkcHB"], "tags": ["cartoon", "pikachu", "2d", "cute", "funny", "cat", "pokemon", "senior", "drawing", "character", "illustration", "grandpa", "collectible", "raichu", "old", "people", "dope", "seniors", "dopeseniors", "lgbtq"], "extra": {}}
