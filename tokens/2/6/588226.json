Back then I used old-school photosuite vista software that came with a Vivitar camera at the time. The creation was part of my 'Flashcore x photography'. A collection of art & photography I made at age 15 but never shared. Today, 24/05/21 I've recovered it from a CD to finally get seen and re-edited it using Photoshop to be more current.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXvEbpZAMLzBtDNoPB8UAzYm6kWMV25imLJjkgdJBcbku", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWzytpTtnYhswoLGrcgMCBFbh1R2J2UJhcSLn4M9fd7Xj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXvEbpZAMLzBtDNoPB8UAzYm6kWMV25imLJjkgdJBcbku", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1djbeg9EgSdNDseGKz3SwJiwg4Jj5awDLf"], "tags": ["digitalart", "glitch", "pixels", "cyber"], "extra": {}}
