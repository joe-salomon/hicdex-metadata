May the gluttons be impaled upon the ribs of the starving and the priests all sell their souls. May the dreamers all awaken in a world that is empty. May the lovers betray and be betrayed. May the poets all choke on their own sweet lies and all bow before their fates. May the seekers wander lost through the valleys and the deserts and lay down to sleep upon stones. May the sick flourish and the healthy be afflicted and may rats fight over the bones. May hate rule pitilessly over a world of the damned where the rivers cease to run. Let the sun set forever on this broken heartland.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSoL5w9cmfa1QYiaxpr9ppfvw6KnzmWrQ1eopf3x7QyFx", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf4xayLvFThKzCgP9nEzQaDPfEPoFVBiWNRudSQ1HePpj", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSoL5w9cmfa1QYiaxpr9ppfvw6KnzmWrQ1eopf3x7QyFx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZY1jm5yN1xEDkRVPHWB2oNsfn6e6bT1KW"], "tags": ["illustration", "drawing", "stippling", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
