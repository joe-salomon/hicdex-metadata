Through the lens of old photographs and films, Minsker leads viewers on a journey through the hurdles that once held him back, from dyslexia to the violence of 1980s Washington D.C. It was these hurdles that forged his love of film and art, and his work now spans across three decades. Man In Camo brings forth not just the love of art, but the reasons for making it in the first place.
