It can't be lifted by ordinary person, yet, the legend said that the bow \"chooses\" a benevolent person to be the one who can use it. \n\nLong story short, one of the contestant successfully lift the bow and fastens the string taut. The successful contestant is Rama.\n\nSoon, Rama and Shinta become the couple that is told as \"the match from heaven\".\n\nBehind the story, there are 2 lingering questions; if they were matched by a contest, does love ever involved from the beginning of their journey? Or the journey that they will go through would only started based on directions instead of truly made from heaven?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeoBYJWkmzsas8bJ9behfNPjn1oLiwz8P4JqLV8j62mCY", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcip7pSZ4gJEWjpEResVtWNaVtTCXtqQJ1u7wosBPwnVq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeoBYJWkmzsas8bJ9behfNPjn1oLiwz8P4JqLV8j62mCY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XSa1ZQ8ECTUL7dwEZKbpqoCs52My3Mnhx"], "tags": ["writings", "wayang", "indonesianwriter"], "extra": {}}
