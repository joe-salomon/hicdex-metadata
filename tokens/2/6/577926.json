{"__version": 1, "token_id": 577926, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "NOTHING REALLY MATTERS ENLIGHTEN A LOST MARYTR", "description": "To say that at some level I'm jaded by a lot of things would be a slight understatement. I vacillate on a razor's edge between confidence and diffidence, empathy and apathy, wise and fool. If you really think about it, on a galactic scale...our problems don't matter at all. From such a lofty perch, life and it's ramifications mean absolutely nothing to the universe. It's at those moments I ponder what actually matters. If we say NOTHING REALLY MATTERS and take the nihilist point of view, shouldn't we leave the door open a crack and make an anagram of it and say in response ENLIGHTEN A LOST MARTYR? We can't go through life just saying nothing matters and wallow in our own self-pity in a one person party. No one likes that guy. If that's you, I'm sorry for insulting you, but come on buddy lighten up a little. We know you're the patron martyr saint of whatever, but most people don't want you to shove mortality, morality, politics, etc down your throat. Oh wait...half this book qualifies to be this. I'm a walking contradiction. We all have days when we become what we hate, but it's how we acknowledge our truths that we're able to move on and be someone new again.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVhcWVSmL6dn8f4XrdVme5NJSAVN3RzDryB2gqM5uRDSY", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdq78apJ8QbT8M6eKuaAz7JLBU7tnLSx6UrYzDL2zSbnN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVhcWVSmL6dn8f4XrdVme5NJSAVN3RzDryB2gqM5uRDSY", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
