{"__version": 1, "token_id": 624126, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Evanescent Causality Violation", "description": "ausality in both special relativity and computer science is defined in terms of sending messages. In special relativity an event A can influence an event B if it is possible for a flash of light sent from A to reach B (putting B inside the future light cone of A). In a similar way, you can view the definition of \"happened before\" in a distributed system (such as that illustrated by the spacetime diagram above) in terms of causality: $a \u2310\u25e8-\u25e8 b$ means that it is possible for event $a$ to causally effect event $b$.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXprB7K9TSdBBaSwnPcWu2yfU9iURT4Ar2kwCeEJtkmy5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXmMxZiSfy5hZx8HekGxXr1yZasJzvFgxp63Xr8FfpBdH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXprB7K9TSdBBaSwnPcWu2yfU9iURT4Ar2kwCeEJtkmy5", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ccWSeMcP9BjwUM5CCCr26w7dZJfxXfRsK"], "tags": ["space", "time", "spacetime", "causality", "genart", "art", "neon", "light", "lightcone", "tungsten", "sci-fi", "2022", "geometry", "colourful"], "extra": {}}
