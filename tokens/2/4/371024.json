These works explore the idea that we all are resonating connected strings. That everything is. A tribute to generative as a concept. Strings with different resonating modes generate space and time, and everything therein. These are just lines rotating at different angular velocities.\n\nA generative artwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro.\n\nMade with Processing, 900x900px looping mp4.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcbLTgGbPjvN52FP4vmuAkLdzHwbXQ3SQwYbU4UFJSpS1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS8sTLyKoMD75ZKiFq8MSEs6czQrmPCwpjfQ81otRCun6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcbLTgGbPjvN52FP4vmuAkLdzHwbXQ3SQwYbU4UFJSpS1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eCX4smQ3LbxwDR3pqNoLQvNNKiHJtpwYz"], "tags": ["geometricart", "generative", "blackandwhite", "iillucid", "codeart", "polylines", "genart", "video", "minimalist", "monochrome", "loop", "artxcode", "generativeart"], "extra": {}}
