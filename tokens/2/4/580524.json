Several tofu industries in this area have been established since the 1960s.\nAnd it is an inherited business from generation to generation.\nAlmost the entire tofu industry in this region still uses traditional tools to produce tofu.\n\nThe basic thing that is often a problem for the tofu industry in this region is the difficulty of finding a suitable tofu maker.\nThis is because many employees have stopped working due to age and the declining interest of young people in the surrounding area to become tofu makers. As a result, the makers of tofu there are mostly people with a fairly advanced age.\nAnd this affects the amount of tofu production.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSypbDKhifr1Y86ihWTags4e5CLXZ2aSLEsFx5MnFnTWf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVgQuvjC5C1bfQ4mondaPA44aast3xn14to7i5FxCeTWu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSypbDKhifr1Y86ihWTags4e5CLXZ2aSLEsFx5MnFnTWf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2ECeDasqwATA13PhcjEGMpZmMBd1nCr7bL"], "tags": ["photography", "film", ""], "extra": {}}
