Each year the municipality (controversially) burns the dry foliage between the beach and parking areas to clear the rubbish and overgrown wildlife so the sign always has a slightly sinister aspect if you happen to visit this beach when the blackened area is still smouldering.\nDrawn around 2014 this is a high res scan of a freehand sketch.
