It's the ultimate point for watching, a little higher on the ground where we can see all parts of our village, and also the next village far away.\nThe village ends here, we stop to visit our shelter.\nThis is another doorway, if you enter from the entrance door, you will see it on your right side. It is where next village appears after desert. Every village has a mosque, a dome. But this blue dome is different in the shape. We walked once from here to that blue dome. It was longer than it looks.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWDa5r9uc5efHxuUP4bjh8Qbs41Ec3e9djy6spMG6F1h1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSi6RSnkh2J6opjZifqQdAPRE8HFMSbkV9j7Rs56VwJtf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWDa5r9uc5efHxuUP4bjh8Qbs41Ec3e9djy6spMG6F1h1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHy1BP5JKcX2CnAV2Hinvz7XwciYQH2DB"], "tags": ["photography", "people", "35mm", "filmphotography", "photo", "analog", "dome", "landscape", ""], "extra": {}}
