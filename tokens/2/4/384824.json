Taking inspiration from the Kawaii culture, colours and shapes, this experimental series tries to emulate the cuteness and flexibility of friendship through the journey of these simple, little buddies and how they interact with each other. Like in a Soft-Body simulation, our little fellows adapt to adversity, change their shapes, merge together and melt into one being; the way friendship should be.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma3fLcYDeX6ck8ZqgjdiHujXDcPR1wAQFcZXnAVpTJLCC", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTuBQKXLBbu25EfFcuq1viDgKZJjiC1HtGnkAkJe3bKqV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma3fLcYDeX6ck8ZqgjdiHujXDcPR1wAQFcZXnAVpTJLCC", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NpnTHeAbiowqzfsmY4RW21dJoEMFAfbqT"], "tags": ["illustration", "kawaii", "digart", "friendship", "3d", "3dart", "characters"], "extra": {}}
