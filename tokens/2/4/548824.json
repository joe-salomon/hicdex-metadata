They manifest energetic shocks, spatial translations, explosions of color and packets of information that happen in my psyche during transcendent processes.\nSunset shows the state of balance between the contents of consciousness and the stillness of meditation; it is a state that includes everyday reality but shows it for what it is: a vibratory flow within the being.\nIt was made in Processing and exported with movie maker in MP4 format.\n\nThe code used is a fork of Landscape by Henrik Linusson, included in his manual of examples for Processing.
