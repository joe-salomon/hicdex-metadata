I have a strong need for both isolation and social interaction. I want to infuse everything with life and love, while simultaneously taking care of myself and moving slowly. I want to be able to live in the midst of primitive, instinctive decision-making, but I also want to be able to pause and reflect. This is life's messiness: we all hold a multiplicity of responsibilities and must adjust to the changes. We are complex beings, and it is through this knowledge that we may achieve equilibrium. Water is a good example. Soft, supple, and flowing. Powerful and open, yet not overbearingly so. Both untamed and calm. Capable of accepting all changes while remaining guided by the tides. That's it.\" by @Baimtje", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWmrrkkmUowE3NncXQ62pq38mjRBVqK4Kv4TryRvHDbVt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdKhknMhLHQHjAZB6HLbqhguYnLSxSPyoQXv2pmkMpASe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWmrrkkmUowE3NncXQ62pq38mjRBVqK4Kv4TryRvHDbVt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ZLdssHoFmvCMBcPA4egvUidMgY3FHi1pe"], "tags": ["abstract", "trippy", "psychedelic", "art", "artwork"], "extra": {}}
