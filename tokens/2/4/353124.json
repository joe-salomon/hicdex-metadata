Kyoto, Japan.\n\nTorii gates are ubiquitous in Japan, as are the Shinto shrines behind them. Beautiful and varied in size and design, the torii establish a spiritual separation between the day-to-day world outside and the spiritual world of Shinto within.\n\nYou will find them everywhere, from busy city streets to serene parks and wilderness areas.\n\nColour photograph. 3103\u200a\u00d7\u200a4137 JPEG.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZhV8wXCuNtmxBDLBNceKC89ggqMYSyhirdpcDHKEhoK9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdC6E8kxBYuiL97AkGTfJfokRrTxK7hUjwq8SJMppqjpz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZhV8wXCuNtmxBDLBNceKC89ggqMYSyhirdpcDHKEhoK9", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lrvhdv6vyLETQAVmrnqVdoT5h7LeQ1zC2"], "tags": ["colour", "color", "photography", "japan", "shinto", "torii", "shrine"], "extra": {}}
