After all, if you turn your head and start thinking, it is very rare to get a cool picture.\n  So, turn off the head. You need to be as flexible as water and take the touches as they are. Allow yourself to create, destroy and re-create them, if necessary, but the touches will be different. Immersed in the process, you gradually become a spectator and creator in one person. Emotions are born in this place, which, when manifested, turn into joyful peace ... Meanwhile, the picture is already living its own life.\n\nArtwork created by Maksym Denysenko in 2020, spray paint on canvas, 200x80 cm, 4601x1931 pix.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR14JsCXdi6YKdoZinb3393opLbsVPK3rRcoCxHVGMAaD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWXjhBpydxWLLxgWsuEiojVaLFeqMRuWV6XJnAqnuLGF2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR14JsCXdi6YKdoZinb3393opLbsVPK3rRcoCxHVGMAaD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1XAThkPLnBA8wC1jUZRbwEJ7ajEaMeXv8A"], "tags": ["Abstraction", "painting", "original", "colorfull", "spraypaint", "canvas", "denysenko_art"], "extra": {}}
