Every so often when in nature, you catch a glimpse of what it must have felt like in a time before human existence. Sometimes, you really don\u2019t have to stray far from the beaten path for these kinds of experiences. The air is quiet, still, and uninterrupted. The surrounding landscape shows no trace of human activity, remaining in an untouched state. There I stood alone amongst the wildflowers, staring out over a sea of lush green vegetation towards a mountain peak in the distance. Everything about this moment felt right. Everything was as it was supposed to be.
