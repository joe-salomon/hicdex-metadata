The citizens of Nekomachi have created an idyllic and warm community\u2014they dance, relax in the bathhouse, water the town plants, and meet up in the middle of the town to talk and stretch their limbs.\n\nThis specific corner of the town is influenced by some of my favorite places and my grandparents' hometown. Every morning during my childhood, my grandfather walked to the local park to chat and exercise with other retirees. Everything we needed was within walking distance\u2014food, nature, and community. Nekomachi is inspired by the places I loved growing up!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQfpUniUSNiz9ihwnAuawESqw9a7LSkd8TfTLbcxYDHKR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWLALirU6yjju5zAQKHZn6Hxwu5CmEJXRMoAvgfqUSniE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQfpUniUSNiz9ihwnAuawESqw9a7LSkd8TfTLbcxYDHKR", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1aGxnkKRrtyMgh3vS2vgMJT5353wvcagod"], "tags": ["illustration", "digital", "cats", "animals", "handdrawn", "plants", "peaceful", "lineart", "landscape", "cartoon", "cute", "city", "detailed", "isometric", "scenery"], "extra": {}}
