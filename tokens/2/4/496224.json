The output of these models can affect humans by reinforcing unintended inputs (positive or negative). These models can be distributed through social media or manifest in law-making, credit applications, education and other ways we may not yet understand. A feedback loop: we are what we consume\u2014and we consume what we are.\n\u2028\nThe following generated GPTSD machine dream texts and images were all output in one session (Dec 2020) after training on 593 dream diary entries by an individual suffering from PTSD after experiencing war. These dream descriptions were cropped directly from a larger text and intentionally unedited except for a few minor deletions for clarity.\u00a0\n\n~~~\n\u2028\nIn my dream: A man tries to call for a cab, but is unable to speak the words and instead makes grunting sounds. I then attempt to call a cab myself, but use a voice synthesizer and come up dry. A woman next to me, a nurse, attempts to induce labor by inserting a small plastic needle into a woman\u2019s arm. After several attempts, the pregnant woman cowers in front of me. I embrace her, hold her close, and tell her to be good. She does as I say, but she becomes weak and eventually dies.\n\n\u2028\n~~~\n\n\u2028The GPTSD book and website will have further information about this project. ryanthompson.name/project-gptsd\n\n\u2028Humans become the stories in which we tell ourselves\u2014and our machines. The tools we create, always manifest the people we come to be.\n\u2028\nDreamer 132 (Text Skeleton)\n1800 x 2280 pixels\nRyan Thompson - December 2020\n\u2028[Once all Dreamers have been collected a second artwork related to the \u201cText Skeleton\u201d will be airdropped to the collector holding this work]", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU9PLoSLud1f8x3oKqxgBgDQEvs4dn6GhBQGgAyycEnBq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmawR7Hzt85opYZA4d3tcTvFZqCRWDcXXY4vRZxshYDYKx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU9PLoSLud1f8x3oKqxgBgDQEvs4dn6GhBQGgAyycEnBq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1R9JSKJLXFBRqVbZAeTzT5Gnw2LoLdnT93"], "tags": ["gptsd", "gpt2", "gpt3", "ptsd", "machinelearning", "ai", "ascii", "neuralnetwork", "dream", "nightmare"], "extra": {}}
