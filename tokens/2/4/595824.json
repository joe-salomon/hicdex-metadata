Ya...it's that good! Don't believe me? Try it for yourself!\n\n..unless you are one of those people that don't like hummus..:thinking:  \n\n\nFor Full Recipe - Use QR Code\n\n\nRecipe & Photos by: Dr. Akala Lemus, D.C.\n9/17/2018\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 can garbanzo beans (drained and rinsed)\n1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes\n1/4 cup of oil from the sun-dried tomatoes\n1-2 cloves of garlic (to taste)\n2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice\n1/4 - 1/2 cup olive oil (pour into food processor to thin to desired consistency)\n1 tsp salt\nfresh ground pepper to taste\n\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Add all ingredients to a food processor - except the olive oil.\n\n2. Slowly add 1/4 cup olive oil while food processor is blending ingredients. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides to make sure everything is well incorporated. The olive oil will help to thin the hummus, so add slowly until you have reached your desired consistency. (NOTE***if you are trying to avoid oil, water can also be used. Start with 1/4 cup and then add 1 tbsp at a time. This also may change the flavor a bit, so more salt or lemon juice may be desired)\n\n\nServe it up with some homemade Kale Pulp Crackers - see OBJKT#576659 for recipe \n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBlog post (9/17/2018): \nhttps://lemuria9.wixsite.com/website-1/post/sundried-tomato-garlic-hummus\n\nIG post (8/31/2018):\nthe making of ~> https://www.instagram.com/p/BnKdN2WgBgo/\n\nthe eating of ~> https://www.instagram.com/p/BnKeNCRAvTy/\n\n*******************************\n\nMinted 12/21/2021:\nMoon 22 deg Cancer\nSun 29 deg Sagittarius\nVenus 26 deg retrograde conj Pluto 25 deg Capricorn\n\n-------------------------------\n\u00a9 2021 Recipe NFTs Inc. \nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nwww.recipeNFTs.com\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeAgTPzxi8uxDr7tUjxmrPdsN2okS5HtaqBhXPBtXyRL4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZeakuER8vSoYuo8uC48KwbN9hRDDqevgfBmXUVKBnDJa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeAgTPzxi8uxDr7tUjxmrPdsN2okS5HtaqBhXPBtXyRL4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hU3XG444nNcSLZyoPwC6LeVndYnMYZML6"], "tags": ["sundriedtomato", "garlic", "lemon", "hummus", "red", "dip", "side", "plantbased", "vegan", "raw", "food", "recipe", "recipenfts", "henrecipes"], "extra": {}}
