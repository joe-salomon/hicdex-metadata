Animation, paths, and gcode created in Blender, Inkscape, & Prusa Slicer. Photographed frame by frame, with each plotted drawing wiped between frames. \n\nTechnical: 58 frames, 12 frames per second. 2160x2160 px. 4 second loop video. \n\nConcept: The simple animated cube form began as the default cube in the Blender 3D modeling application. A cube can represent the reductive basis for a modular system. The cube is a brick or building block, the simplest element from which complexity might emerge. In the process of printing and erasing a contrast emerges between the defined toolpaths of printed geometry and the atmospheric residue of the wiping and erasing process.
