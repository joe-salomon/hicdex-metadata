AI is very competitive when it comes to producing abstract works. \n2. AI finds its greatest difficulty in the representation of the human body and faces. This is the reason why I decided to teach him to make faces and portraits. Some of the results are included in this collection. \n3. Concerning the previous point: AI achieves better results when starting from a sketch or photograph. A curiosity: the word \"androids\" performs better than the word \"humans\". \n4. I still haven't gotten him to perform a kiss satisfactorily. But the production line is still open.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbnGn2QD5niiJTkTyB3iSEgcsbtaZAkpXMHR9QTuWg3un", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbnGn2QD5niiJTkTyB3iSEgcsbtaZAkpXMHR9QTuWg3un", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbnGn2QD5niiJTkTyB3iSEgcsbtaZAkpXMHR9QTuWg3un", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hfFMMcYmsXdaxAPR9BHuNTqerdZuQAHBE"], "tags": ["ganart", "aiart", "AI-generated", "androids", "cryptoart", "zoku"], "extra": {}}
