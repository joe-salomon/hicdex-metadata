The funny thing is that, with the phone, I shoot mostly landscapes, which I don't usually do with my reflex.\nSo I decided to mint some of it in a special edition of 10, 100 pcs each at 1 XTZ.\nEvery picture has its own story, its own moment, its own place. \nPlease, enjoy it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTk33pS3Zc3Vg69y2ovK4S8t2mt4FcrS7e51YEniL731G", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmay1A4D4qBHU7qrJ7YLe1dufFqkqG2uXFvLqBE6eRSMX2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmR89DF4iTjxetPbsDK9cfhBfGtN5LLn21m7CQxYx8Sppu", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTk33pS3Zc3Vg69y2ovK4S8t2mt4FcrS7e51YEniL731G", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ZpmbuFzaLx8Gzut2vPnEW245FsbVhkNKv"], "tags": ["smarphonephotography", "photography", "landscape", "moody", "photographer", "limitededition", "smartphone", "phone"], "extra": {}}
