I minted my first ever NFTs on \ua729 and was fairly happy with the result and how easy everything was. The Angel is a symbol of hope against the IRL Art Market Cartel, NFTs bring hope to what once was an elitist corrupt hopeless market. Gives back to the artist and collectors who can freely reinvent the art market\n\nMore technical aspects, original handmade piece was drawn on 50% recycled coffee cups A4 paper cut by me, using Sakura Micron Pens, 0.4 and 0.1. The color is set as a dimed yellow overlaid on a TrueGrit Texture of paper in order of mimicking a gold engraving on black textured paper.
