He\u2019d talk about your learning, your realization, about your awareness  He\u2019d say your unconscious mind knows a lot more than you do. Your unconscious mind can do that, he\u2019d go right to action, moving the path to habits. It\u2019s your inner knowledge. And he would take us there. Solution focused is positive, it\u2019s in our control and it\u2019s specific, ecological it\u2019s what would be good for us? What are the habits that allow us to live a balanced life? That means it has to be physical, something I can do with my physical energy. It needs to be positively relational. Our relationship needs to be about who we are, not about who we aren't. It needs to be focused on the future because our intentions to move in the moment, to take action must direct us forward or we ourselves don\u2019t know who we are as soon as we go into negatives. It needs to be meaningful, we need to find the deeper meaning that we can share. That's solution focused.\n Quote by Marilyn W. Atkinson\n\nQuote by Marilyn W.
