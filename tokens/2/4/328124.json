{"__version": 1, "token_id": 328124, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "BE WATER", "description": "Bruce Lee was one of the most, if not the most influential Asian American. He taught us how to be proud of who we are and to express\nit fully without hesitance or compromise. He taught his martial arts and\nhis philosophy to anyone who would listen, breaking all boundaries. He taught us that there\u2019s a time to roll with the punches, but also a time to unite and stand up for each other.\n\n\u201cWater can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\u201d\n\nAll proceeds from the sale of this piece will be donated through www.standwithasians.com to reach groups across the US in order to advocate against violence towards Asian Americans, and help those communities that have suffered and are suffering through this pandemic of hate.\n\nJuly 20th 2021 marks 48 years since Bruce Lee left our world. On this day I hope that we can channel a little bit of his spirit and raise some awareness to this cause.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWX5Z9RCg8Zs64k372NGzAQZFHn7TS41wXBvtdrjoN2ao", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW591Qq9YkmYExiwb6mpbNWJ2sfM1j15YGivMpYThvUZn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWX5Z9RCg8Zs64k372NGzAQZFHn7TS41wXBvtdrjoN2ao", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Uq7NjRY9ZoFZ6NmeAfP7q4X9QRDsEWX3Y"], "tags": ["motiongraphics", "motiongraphic", "graphic", "animated", "perfection", "motion"], "extra": {}}
