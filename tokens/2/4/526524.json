Portobelo used to be one of the most important ports during the Spanish colony. It was invaded by pirates several times, notably  by Vernon, Drake and Henry Morgan, who eventually travelled south and took Panama City. Today, Portobelo is a cultural heritage site with vibrant traditions. Colorful boats such as the Virgen del Carmen dot the bay at dawn, and serve as both fishing boats and tourist transportation.\n\n.jpg 2515x1415", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmccwPtEzgbZXe3aeMuYh9MZTX5xbVPXsQsjRGVzwVgN6F", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZoRxKvgce1FQCofifXmT5mMUzkXNDaCgnh3NMDs4ZMMX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmccwPtEzgbZXe3aeMuYh9MZTX5xbVPXsQsjRGVzwVgN6F", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DNUfVXNdZsciK76XCxEU715L6DXg132oQ"], "tags": ["Portobelo", "photography", "color", "boat", "bay", "history", "water", "ocean", "sea"], "extra": {}}
