Lighting Points and Shadows.\n\nThese is the artistic proposal that I carry in my heart and for which I wish to be recognized. My subjects are very varied and range from Nature, Animals, Plants, Landscapes, Urban Environment, Selfies, Portraits, Abstractions, Toy Art, Agriculture, Sunsets and whatever I can think of.\n\nMy name is Fran Afonso and I started as a photography hobbyist more than 10 years ago, then I studied Audiovisual Sciences and became a Professional. I am one of the two Directors of the Project \"Sembrando un Pa\u00eds\" (SUP) and to this I owe my username.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRUQoH44JdV937dc5htdkjGXzmnXoN3resLNC9roQHnCw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmefW288voh5x5t6soqqHdnBq4Zqa7ERiKCgZdMHMRxnp8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRUQoH44JdV937dc5htdkjGXzmnXoN3resLNC9roQHnCw", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i5UH7DW6ZMRf7NMw9PFCvDrbkB5qDGPjs"], "tags": ["PhotograpicArt", "sup"], "extra": {}}
