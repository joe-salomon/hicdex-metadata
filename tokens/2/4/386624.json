This work expresses part of these processes where we see two masks symbolizing the faces of our multiple personalities, are we really what we want to be? The snake's venom almost reaches the eyes and this same snake that dissolves in the crystalline, in the quartz, in the Christ, dissolves in looks throughout the cosmos and small universes, many sensations and many learnings throughout all spheres of the quantum field, for on the other hand, nature and its evolutionary ladder, the butterfly, transformation and freedom of expression, but also the brevity of what is good.\n\nYear: 2019-2020 | Technique: Black pen on paper\n\nThis artwork is from a limited edition of 10 prints\nPrinted in UltraChrome HD mineral pigment - Epson\n297x420 mm Hahnem\u00fchle Museum Etching 350g\nWagner Possati - Brazil - S\u00e3o Paulo 2020\n\n3508x4961pixels | .jpg | 96dpi | 11.5 MB\n\nThis art is part of a collection of 4 works released by Gallery Visionariom Art.\nThis NFT was generated as a gift from a physical work.\nwww.visionariom.com\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPePiewh6huRFY6K8XrPQrEFAkWKtyWNULGDzLE1EoG9G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWHKRguK4jGnpMw5iU4RaXvQ6ECfjm4b9n2SR9jkDExiE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPePiewh6huRFY6K8XrPQrEFAkWKtyWNULGDzLE1EoG9G", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RbevQhPbo6mfBW9mrmNZzju5hHrpaG5QP"], "tags": ["visionariomgallery", "visionariom", "serpent", "obrjkt", "brazil", "wagnerroza"], "extra": {}}
