The primary subject of all of the paintings in the series are stacks of hay in the field after the harvest season. This series is among Monet's most notable work.\n\nWe managed to obtain a strong digital feed which displays some of the finest texture from the original canvases with only one minor glitch in transmission.\u0003We believe this artwork is a heavily cropped adaption with several of Monet's paintings collated into one. \n\nAs far as we are aware this is all that remains in digital form, we are hoping to uncover more of Monet's work as we probe deeper into the old galleries.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeuhVdrbTAfJHfbMCseKAihYWox2aweu9i8oTnfAze22q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaxM4ofk5dz8wX273V98aWUsYmatZCjJqapQLx79tzxLP", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeuhVdrbTAfJHfbMCseKAihYWox2aweu9i8oTnfAze22q", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1f9TBznxnaPVmh6V7JRXQYK3qkPQfFn5wV"], "tags": ["remastered", "monet"], "extra": {}}
