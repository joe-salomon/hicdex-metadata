A structure standing far away from its land of origin. Far from where it was planned. Conquering or maybe waiting for that cry of duty that will allow it a first massive and deadly step onto its target.\u00a0\nThe Black Tower of Exile, so called by the habitants in their surroundings since the creation of the Holy Land, emanates a disturbing uncertainty. A sleeping giant filled with a black sea of mystery, believed to be crafted during the Dark Ages, and in which the summit rests a sort of insect resembling the ones we see and read in the Book of Extinction from times we can't reach anymore. Is it awakened? is it part of the tower? \nLegend has it that the King of Aasveigh walked its interiors in his first day of the Eternal Greens and was never the same. And any other unsettling detail you might hear, may well just be bedtime stories.\u00a0", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfBtFuavxGagi1ahan8cDgjjyusPVgwfY97KEhAzWTtpm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRpvRqxYHFEPn5hNPn17r9u861Lnyyfhj6T7iX6GxdPu5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfBtFuavxGagi1ahan8cDgjjyusPVgwfY97KEhAzWTtpm", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1fjSyzy5CArd5fByVo3mw6UBpjF7LZf1XF"], "tags": ["black", "tower", "exile", "shoka", "trading", "cards"], "extra": {}}
