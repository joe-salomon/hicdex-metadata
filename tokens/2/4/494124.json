With superhuman strength, regenerative properties and tough scales, the ability to breath underwater and on land, and ancient Devonian claws that can rip a human into shreds, the Gill Lords are amphibious nightmares out of your childhood dreams.\n\nA Gill Lord is an extremely dangerous foe in any aquatic environment due to its aquatic prowess and ability to see in incredibly dark environments. However, because it is susceptible to terrestrial weapons and is relatively slow on land, the Gill Lord is classified as a Creeper.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNcNaqs9f4Y1FUGJL8V5jqXq3nDwjKXhjkuXcWEniYNbt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfFh7qoFBN6osAKbfZVFGFJ3k7Foi6iy3XchdjSsL8wqG", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNcNaqs9f4Y1FUGJL8V5jqXq3nDwjKXhjkuXcWEniYNbt", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["darkart", "darkwheeldemon", "orderofthedarkwheel", "creature", "gillman", "monster", "demon", "horror", "horrorart"], "extra": {}}
