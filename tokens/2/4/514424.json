Comfort zone!\n\nBut we are not aware, actually it is like a poisonous snake that creeps calmly towards us, ready to prey on us slowly with its very subtle and deadly venom.\n\nSeize the great opportunities of our future in the cradle of short comforts. Devouring freedom explores our passions. Gripping cruelly on our warrior identity that ends with a future so bleak as sour fruit at the end of a delicious meal.\n\n'Comfort Zone' is life's detention!\n\n.\n\nDigital Illustration | Photoshop | 3000 x 3000 px | 300 ppi\nAgus Setyawan | @angoes25 | 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYsaob4MJJ6hJsyoWyLtWLHLcHGVhcNKDiz9TLnQDLZvK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdarsEQH7NX4eMT9qsp2SPvu6FAT9MtcckR3c9YGQvJor", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYsaob4MJJ6hJsyoWyLtWLHLcHGVhcNKDiz9TLnQDLZvK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WcEHgjivUndAq5H91gwnjLYTnvD4M45Fj"], "tags": ["drawing", "snake", "hebi", "illustration", "venomous", "art", "2D", "Indonesia", "nftbiker", "predator"], "extra": {}}
