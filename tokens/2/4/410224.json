It keeps me from being tranquil and at peace but everyday i try to fight it. Everytime i get the chance to do someting creative, i pour my soul into doing whatever it is. This is my only way to keep the fire going. Nevertheless, i believe with what the Universe planned for me. I truly hold on to the idea that i can get pass all the challenges and be what i've always wanted to be; a full time artist. That is why i will never get tired to screaming what i treasure into the Universe until i get it. \n\nI hope you'll be with me in this journey.\n\n8000X10000px\nOriginal artwork by Vilton", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZebQbhk8XUPJGdPKgsqHjZpwjEU2PG4zWKjpPwTWaYcu", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmarhn5aoUA9MzwJFF3Xb1P2EiY1YKQniCCaF1mh1iMv8y", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZebQbhk8XUPJGdPKgsqHjZpwjEU2PG4zWKjpPwTWaYcu", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1aTwFo2UU44U7C2M7yJb11zbEtCJBMfaGQ"], "tags": ["love", "passion", "art", "self", "dreams", "motivation", "journey", "inspirational", "nftart", "digitalart", "red", "illustration", "red", "nftasia", "drawing"], "extra": {}}
