Pisces symbolizes trascendance and transmutation of the soul; in pisces theres no intelect, mind as a delimited space, theres integration, a different grasp of memory for the body and soul. Remembrance is not subdue to linear time, and if we see alzheimer as \"the lost of memory and phisical faculties\", pisces would say: as the return to the origin and reintegrating the whole to depart again. A gasp of eternity driven by love, capable of traveling thru space and time, moon as the witness.
