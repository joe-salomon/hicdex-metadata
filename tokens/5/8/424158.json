It usually rains after the carnival. There are also those who say that the fruits are filled with flies. But the latter is unprovable.\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf4Wp5NehjZeR9vbB2SuSVHV2dS1hz9FZFB1iTfszP9DA", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma6KMNDDME6R9EdbQH3E4hKeAbGycSCAKtzsaRkYVV4mB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf4Wp5NehjZeR9vbB2SuSVHV2dS1hz9FZFB1iTfszP9DA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Stamps", "Carnival", "Illustration"], "extra": {}}
