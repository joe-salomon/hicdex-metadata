One time, Aji Saka sent Dora to meet Sembada and bring her heirloom. Dara then went to Sembada and conveyed about his master's orders. However, Sembada refused because according to Aji Saka's previous orders, no one was allowed to bring the heirloom except Aji Saka himself.\nHowever, Sembada refused because according to Aji Saka's previous orders, no one was allowed to bring the heirloom except Aji Saka himself.\nAs a result, two of Aji Saka's servants suspected each other that each of them intended to steal the heirloom.
