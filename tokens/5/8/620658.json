Glad to introduce \"Thara\".\n\nMy dream today is cool because today I met the fairy of the river \"Thara\".\n\nThara has hair as a stream of clear water. It flowed in the forest floating in the air. So beautiful, I told myself. \n\nTara was kind. She smiled at me and floated away with a beautiful stream. Wonderful Dream :-)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXjqXcJaQXoxKHZcj11LjpKNiBcRU6JD1kiczLTmJVpVT", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmes3ZK6SfWTYhj9jtRPTx4cbG7Bs1QVvhKnfFxEef6Ayu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmRp6jp59oxXxDVUvLd71yMtVggPtVzZUwRNHfNAAFNrGg", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXjqXcJaQXoxKHZcj11LjpKNiBcRU6JD1kiczLTmJVpVT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Nteg2MbfJX69CTU8uti32scym2A2gY7V1"], "tags": ["Dollemmie", "DreamDolls", "Doll", "Thara", "RiverFairy", "Illustration", "DigitalArt", "Difital", "Art", "DoodleArt", "TheFourFaries", "LongHair", "Water", "WaterFairy", "BlueSea", "Blue", "CuteFairy", "CuteDoodle"], "extra": {}}
