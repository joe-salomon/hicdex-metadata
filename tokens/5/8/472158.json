I never know which one to choose, both remind me of the color of your eyes.\n\nI am a terrible plant mother, but I am sure that all my flowers would open for you. Even the ones I cultivate in secret places on my body.\n\nThat night I wanted to invite you to dinner, but you couldn't. Too much work, too tired.\n\nI thought of inviting you for an afternoon coffee and then maybe you would stay for dinner. You couldn't do it either. \n\nToo much work, too tired.\n\nThe night came and I didn't even want to bother inviting you anymore. I got tired of waiting for someone who will never arrive.\n\nI opened some wine, sat down with my good old loneliness, and must have fallen asleep in some chapter of my book.\n\nI woke up and made myself some tea, the idea of coffee seemed too bitter.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcdiGfTm398PckiihczYnTLoh9s6ZUYksXBxqgH5gzxP1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU85p8cXzTw1AQVGK5T7V6Q9sjvWRf66ee3CoWv74EQpn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcdiGfTm398PckiihczYnTLoh9s6ZUYksXBxqgH5gzxP1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LpSupdqLgfFo8gEafWfmi8SQjSrPTqXmc"], "tags": ["Collage", "Poetry", "WatercolorPainting", "analog"], "extra": {}}
