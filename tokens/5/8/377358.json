The skull's resonant frequency is in tune with the electromagnetic field emanated by humans. The POWERSKULL would eliminate the barrier that separates the skull bearer's thoughts and the thoughts of other living beings. The human carrying the Scarlet Telepathy Cranium would obtain the permanent ability to communicate with any living being across any distance using only the mind.\n\nOther living forms' magnetic fields would not be tuned to the Transmutational Healing Cranium and would not activate it.\n\nThe POWERSKULLZ are part of the POWERVERSE, a reality where humans have achieved their highest potential and live as gods.\n\n_\nGIF - 50 fps - 1080 x 1080 px\n\n_\nThanks to @billellis for the superb skull model.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbBMieqHyfVnwMUNzfQdZ4RW8Ux25dsYn7Hcwd4Nci2S6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbBMieqHyfVnwMUNzfQdZ4RW8Ux25dsYn7Hcwd4Nci2S6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbBMieqHyfVnwMUNzfQdZ4RW8Ux25dsYn7Hcwd4Nci2S6", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1cALi4cQRKtSMCU92nkmtQtZPZGppeHke1"], "tags": ["cyberpunk", "mementomori", "billellis", "objkt4objkt", "death", "porwerverse", "powerskullz", "glow", "cranium", "skull", ""], "extra": {}}
