For this reason, Tancho koi are very popular.\n\nThe Tancho class consists of Kohaku, Sanke or Showa koi who have a single hi (red) spot on their head. For a competition koi to be classed as Tancho, the hi spot must be between the koi\u2019s eyes, not reach as far back as the shoulder and not run down to the nose. Also, there must be no other hi colouration on the koi's body.\n\nTancho is not a breedable trait, it only ever occurs by chance.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSCsQgzaMyTMmfc5DNSaMs5t1gy3C1AJsSchwcveLKoZG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSvUYmB22gz8qMB2M1YV2wrDwsz1TRRN1z9qbTwf4KzAB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSCsQgzaMyTMmfc5DNSaMs5t1gy3C1AJsSchwcveLKoZG", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1grqTYEZd5f7Pjw8DYXtodcfjhh3BvwFEQ"], "tags": ["tancho", "japan", "koi", "carp"], "extra": {}}
