We start with the word ART (for obvious reasons) and then write ART downwards from the \"A\". From this point all we need to do is write down or think about words that begin with \"R\" and \"T\" and think about what letters each of these would share in words. We can choose words like ROW and TWO to complete the word square. As you can see an order 3 word square is a piece of cake compared to an order 6 version. Imagine an order 10 word square? That would be impressive. Maybe one day I'll get to that level.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRo2A6ZkxzqbsyqK5zut9FXw92i8tQeL5Vb8CpfMGWCas", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWKV2GSpqmM8c8MUnkwnVhqmqy5XmTAASZjRHFH4CY2Hz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRo2A6ZkxzqbsyqK5zut9FXw92i8tQeL5Vb8CpfMGWCas", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
