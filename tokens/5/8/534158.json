Some of her first objects are broccoli, trees, slide, swing, and Dad. \n\nThis was her garden. Somehow it reminds me of my trip to Tokyo, not really sure why.\n---\n\nThis project is a collaborative & learning platform between a tired mother and her bubbly (almost) 3 years old daughter. Art, Crafts, and Music have always been in her daily activities along with running around the house, helping dad in the studio, and climbing stuff. \n\nSupport our journey into NFT by collecting our creations or connect with us via Twitter. We'd love to make some new friends!\n\n<3\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUXbLLaszHAvLvm3P1qrbyhL9BNMqGjw7GN1jY3e3tbMV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUB69wchPrfTkWmrpZbfqrQmU43M5eQFH3UzJNas3179b", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUXbLLaszHAvLvm3P1qrbyhL9BNMqGjw7GN1jY3e3tbMV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UHcq4e7QkYpwkAGp9cC6TqMtPsauj8Fed"], "tags": ["nftkid", "kidsontheblockchain", "nftcommunity", "womanincrypto", "itsmondayart", "youngnft", "nftkidsmag", "painting", "cleannft", "youngartist", "nftasia", ""], "extra": {}}
