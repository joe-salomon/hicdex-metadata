The result is a series of unique artworks, entirely created and written in the programming language R (code).\n\npng.file (6000x6000)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmaoh4mgkoaVea3XbrLshZoGkEGa3sq7ZxwdMFsbUNwoVs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaKvaCoX7JrvJVKEWBn4vAdjD4aPviPhLdwneMJkDapWs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmaoh4mgkoaVea3XbrLshZoGkEGa3sq7ZxwdMFsbUNwoVs", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2NfC2V4eJqReWcCxpDtb6srS8HPKxs86sX"], "tags": ["balloon", "creativecoding", "generative", "rtistry", "generativeart"], "extra": {}}
