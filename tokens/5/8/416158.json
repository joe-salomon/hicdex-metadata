Soon after, all records and equipment, save for this item, were placed entirely out of public view.\n\nThis digital \"token\" confers upon you\na portion of the aesthetic and para-natural\npower of this radiant meta-object.\n\nThink on the maker of this physical item\nand send them your gratitude\nthrough the centuries - for the\nprivilege of holding it's\nmeta-verse avatar.\n\nI took this photo and \nwas blessed by this object and \nthe sincere expression of it's maker.\n\nI truly hope my photo gives a portion\nof that sense of inter-dimensional possibilty to you.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVFtq32uV4NnYa4r6ugbSGfxtg4Zrqmc2TwC2DBE5c9j3", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb4kbx2pbhuH2qJArtbUSKDZ4e9EoRY3NFCPgkfwjqNhx", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVFtq32uV4NnYa4r6ugbSGfxtg4Zrqmc2TwC2DBE5c9j3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Nh672Ln1KRwVgXVdS6NR3NcSWjUSPaFuB"], "tags": ["metal", "sphere", "lucid", "dreaming", "xarlemyn", "bradamante"], "extra": {}}
