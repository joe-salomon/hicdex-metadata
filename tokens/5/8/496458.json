These creatures tend to warp in and out of existence, stuck in a phantom-like state between our dimension and the Abyssal Void.\n\n\nThese creatures are usually signs that there is some shift in the natural order of things between the two dimensions, perhaps foreshadowing the coming of a great force that shall either fight for or against humanity. Whether they\u2019re reacting to the Order stepping forth from the shadows, or the appearance of the Harbinger witch, it is impossible to know for certain.\n\nRegardless of their ability to phase and travel between dimensions, they surprisingly do not attack humans, nor can they be easily dispelled and often the best course of action is to ignore them. They are seen as mere nuisances and are classified as Sub-Creeper.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQfWyWLW3nT4bHy5farbWcZkC4NeSa5DwPBwpxuB9VJvm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQfWyWLW3nT4bHy5farbWcZkC4NeSa5DwPBwpxuB9VJvm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQfWyWLW3nT4bHy5farbWcZkC4NeSa5DwPBwpxuB9VJvm", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["darkwheeldemon", "orderofthedarkwheel", "demon", "monster", "gif", "creature", "halloween", "darkart", "horror", "horrrorart"], "extra": {}}
