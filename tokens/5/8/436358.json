This work tells in part my experience but I am sure that many people could also feel identified since at the end of the day we all at some point pretend to live something we did not want and drown the artist that we always carry inside. The world is full of great artists who deserve to shine and decentralization thanks to new technologies are the means to reach that goal, democratizing access to art can be a reality for everyone.\n\nTechnique used:\nflat vector design\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeKMCN8EsQVgTqX3CH7kGDGgV5sHt4cMrvKKmRaQEY1vc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcUabryW1qX7kteNqVLuzUfcienU5njvN65wx2XNzDtHe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeKMCN8EsQVgTqX3CH7kGDGgV5sHt4cMrvKKmRaQEY1vc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WpRvGr1cjeBtyVeK4kq2v44USmcAqhnUa"], "tags": ["Architecture", "architectural", "motivational", "2d", "flat", "color", "illustration", "fantasy", "fantastic", ""], "extra": {}}
