An accountant from Meowming, a state far from Mew York. That day he was scolded by his boss for not doing the cat calculation properly. \n\u201cI was tired, boss.\u201d, he said.\n\u201cWell, everyone is also tired!\u201d\nHe stood in silence.\n\u201cNow we won\u2019t be able to get extra Whizzkaz, and your bonus will be cut for this month.\u201d, his boss left him in confusion.\nHe went home angrily but not forgetting to piss on his boss\u2019s desk before leaving.\nOn his way home, he challenged all of the street cats for a battle, but no one dared to do that. They were afraid of his blobby belly.\nUpon his arrival at home, he decided to watch his favorite series on Petflix and eat fresh tuna.\n\u201cAh, who cares about work? I still have my human to feed me.\u201d\nHe ended his day with an exercise to keep his blobby shape perfect.\n\u201cTomorrow is my hairball day. Well, get ready for a new desk, boss.\u201d", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUZJWStBQEU2KfkiM8swxdCJpvBH38T1kyUDBRxitfYBM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmagbCBjNkyzQapQyMGMDWBRaZu8osipwCtYkZuXFDKNm6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUZJWStBQEU2KfkiM8swxdCJpvBH38T1kyUDBRxitfYBM", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz2HpgpGoZtP58xrE1ZjFHFUjqrodJHzezaa"], "tags": ["NFTCollectibles", "NFTs", "illustration", "cat", "hicetnunc2000", "pet"], "extra": {}}
