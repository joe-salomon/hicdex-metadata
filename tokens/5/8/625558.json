Like The Smiths' music, this work has in it a melancholy and a nostalgia for a time long ago. Rhythmic chords, soft melody and very impressive. Executed in acrylic and oil pastel on canvas, with expressive and fluid color dynamics, its palette composed only of primary colors puts us as spectators of something that our memory immediately recognizes, but when we look in more detail, it impacts by the rawness of its lines and by the expression of chaos of its composition. It's impossible to stay neutral in front of her.\n\nIf you buy this NFT I send you the original artwork>\nSend me a message in Twitter @marcuscorrea\n\nLink to art galery of artwork:\nhttps://www.artmajeur.com/pt/marcuscorrea/artworks/14860613/there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXnNSbDqpv9DRWenBrLX9sbAnoC1xMhgKhDjqY7yRRNQG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTm35Zb3n2haQMsC5qjTbAyTuzrKAmYYbSatxQXQPVKr2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXnNSbDqpv9DRWenBrLX9sbAnoC1xMhgKhDjqY7yRRNQG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TFhjdZJiKH7JwJ1sVSRCbXMyadrN5F1fU"], "tags": ["artwork", "painting", "art", "acryliconcanvas", "modernart", ""], "extra": {}}
