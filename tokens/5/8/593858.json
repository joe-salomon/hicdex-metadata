When we think of our environment as completely surrounded by photographs, human life is largely based on looking, seeing and remembering. When \"time\" comes into the work, these photographic images lose their concreteness and move towards abstraction. Photographic time changes our perception of \"Time\" and creates a new reality out of what we see. Long and multiple exposures, movement and compositions are the means of conveying a subjective reality, changing the perception of time and space, leading to different interpretations. These experiments bring photography closer to abstraction and pictorial results. The time&space change of the image causes different perceptions and emotions to emerge at the moment which the image and the light are recorded. Space, time, and motion melt, creating new images that are open to multiple interpretations. Time manipulations create an image with an intangible energy.
