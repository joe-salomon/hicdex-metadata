Nodebox is a node-based visual language for generative art based on Python. Each artwork generated with this software is unique, since what is generated is a result of a numerical value that serves as input (a so-called 'random seed'). By changing this variable a large variety of work can be generated. This is number #722452 of the program \u2018Occluded Squares with Multiple Line Widths on a Noise Grid\u2019\n\nThis is a \u2018plottable artwork\u2019. Which means it can be drawn by a machine: a penplotter. I am happy to deliver a physical drawing after purchase. In this case transfer 10 tez to florisdejonge.tez (from the same address as the one owning the NFT) to cover the materials and shipping. Feel free to DM me via twitter.com/floris_de_jonge or instagram.com/dejongefloris/. Pictures of plotted designs can be seen there as well. \n\nThis design is plotted with white Rotring ink using an Isograph 0.6 pen on ClaireFontaine Troph\u00e9e Black 210 grams A4 paper.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaZT8C5mqZRNph8X9zRRk7ZSW4oAxa2urEuUgjoxPmoGk", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmaZT8C5mqZRNph8X9zRRk7ZSW4oAxa2urEuUgjoxPmoGk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaZT8C5mqZRNph8X9zRRk7ZSW4oAxa2urEuUgjoxPmoGk", "mimeType": "image/svg+xml"}], "creators": ["tz1SHteAqHWkCUKvHGTNScNyuZLw4vd43jse"], "tags": ["Generative", "plot", "penplotter", "svg", "vector", "pattern", "geometric", "physicalNFT"], "extra": {}}
