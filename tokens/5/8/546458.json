You discover that deviations are simply pathways to further creative growth.\nThe artistic process is what got me through the psychologically harrowing experience of losing so many figments of my cultural reality- daily \u2018life\u2019 ceased to exist, and this work creates a vortex of access to the world within you, contributing to a sense of creative self-sufficiency, exhilaration, and encounter with your own muse.]\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeBJgSWNhT7WwJ9cPUtUn33rqWeFvbdFkBsLBjyY1Kgvx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP2hTuFiqT7kyEdixvznHjWb9DoH5PySjLmBGuBpVAkM4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeBJgSWNhT7WwJ9cPUtUn33rqWeFvbdFkBsLBjyY1Kgvx", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz2AyVdV4ndCRzUWfiYQVtXQQuY1ds9NfPV3"], "tags": ["Lessthan1tezos", "Creativity", "Imagination", "Virtualreality", "XR", "unicorn", "psychedelicart"], "extra": {}}
