Her steps were wobbly.\nIsn\u2019t she tired of carrying all of that around, all the time?\nHer hands were too busy to carry a new thing that might be lighter.\nI guess, losing it all actually would open a new self of her.\n\n\u201cForgive yourself. Whatever you\u2019re holding onto or carrying around from the past, let it go.\u201d -Mel Robbins\n\nWatercolor on cold press paper\n2500px x 3600px\n\nPersonal use only.
