She spends most of her days skimming through the twitterverse at extremely high speed to analyze and find the rarest of all resources. Actually, she is an early citizen of the Metaverse, who originally lived in the year 2028. A secret of an old friend led her to find a way to travel through time and reach the year of 2068, where the Metaverse is already the core of mortal - and seemingly immortal life. Unit:1774 already merged parts of her body and mind with the Metaverse itself at early arrival, which made her understand the new rules of life incredibly fast. She has still yet to find a way back, since new security environments don\u2019t leave much space for rifts - the blockchain is perfect. \n\nNext to spending time in the Metaverse, Unit:1774 loves to live the old school type of way, smoking weed in her apartment, relaxing and growing her own trees. She has an extremely good sense for plants and humor.\n\nartwork by crypt0_gal\n\nhttps://twitter.com/crypt0_gal\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRqc3nqRAnDYLTXV38GfLEnCK2FbGFNagQBJhmnX6n9a3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRqTuWnHsFaj3GkTKMiEAZsVJKJPwXytHH3vexxFWf9tE", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRqc3nqRAnDYLTXV38GfLEnCK2FbGFNagQBJhmnX6n9a3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1N7DF4VcH5es2LbTkgMHZe2eKgGryfyEU1"], "tags": ["crypt0_gal", "twitter", "anime", "illustration", "metaverse", "citizen", "crypto", "girl", "futuristic", "sci-fi"], "extra": {}}
