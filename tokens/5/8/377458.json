Who are we? How are we here? Who created us? How many is out there? So many questions in our minds.. So many answers... I feel like no one can be right or wrong with these questions.. Its something we don't have answers for.. And maybe never will living in this physical life... But I do know that once we move on to our spiritual life.. We will know more answers...
