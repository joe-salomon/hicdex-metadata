{"__version": 1, "token_id": 606558, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Passage", "description": "Passages is biuld  out of photographs from Germany, England and Brazil, using analog photography and digital manipulation processes. The photographs are reconstructed through overlays, erasures and cuttings, in a process of thinking about how memory and imagination work. I try to emphasize not only these layers, but also the fine line in which the lived and imagined memories are lost and found, where real and fabulation are confused, such as inside and outside, and where a public place also recalls more intimate and familiar spaces . First I choose the film, for its materiality, the randomness, the delay and the charm of waiting and, secondly, the digital manipulation that, as the name already says, manipulates and reconstructs the events and the memory itself. This manipulation is not, therefore, by chance or aesthetics, but because it recognizes in a present time relationships between other times, experiences and places. Once the photographs are merged, it is difficult to think of them as an event of a single instant, of the photographed instant.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmVaWNEHsocgQirq36SamYiXDU8ZQSKAFFx7DocXsDqEDf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQUJvi7gkLZrUM1MCb5fPcBgAt2VcHp5UWobihsPzHKsv", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmVaWNEHsocgQirq36SamYiXDU8ZQSKAFFx7DocXsDqEDf", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1fiBqoHxaX6hTGhPoYvqoFj8ap5LbDpSaZ"], "tags": ["Photography", "manipulation", "memory", "Digitalcollage", "blackandwhite", "passage"], "extra": {}}
