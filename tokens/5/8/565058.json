Eventually it dissolves into an incomprehensible jumble of wavelengths and light ribbons representing the total convergence of art, economics and human thought.\n\n\u201cCoin Of The Realm\u201d is the first in the Physical Math series of 4k NFTs, all of which connect to the ancestral memory of primal fire and everything that first blinking light unleashed. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmecJTLjLgF7HLxGaXtfUGSceEa88jPkcBAu3qRh2Xhzk4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRYfZrWGoonGEcJnTjyjFcQS5e7JpyWNUob1ANzCS8Zvi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmecJTLjLgF7HLxGaXtfUGSceEa88jPkcBAu3qRh2Xhzk4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1gm2GLmex4ZocgigaYHCBkeWLtMYZEKU1q"], "tags": ["blackandwhite", "monochrome", "modular", "eurorack", "vectrex", "analogvideo"], "extra": {}}
