A keeper of its own history, yet to be written, forever remaining on a blockchain.\n\nThis is a long-lasting interactive experiment in which the roles between collectors and the piece are inverted. The piece was made to \"own\" the collectors, not the other way around. Once it gets collected, the collector creates a new bone in the structure that is going to remain forever. Even after swapping their token. \n\nFor this experiment to work as intended, please follow these rules \u2764\ufe0f:\n\n* you can collect as many editions as you want\n* please do not hold your tokens, as it will prevent the piece from growing\n* it is encouraged to try making profit from your trades, as it will change the shape of the structure, but please keep it reasonable\n\nI'm hoping that you won't feel the need to keep this piece in your collection, but rather come back once in a while to see how you contributed to its shape.\n\nThe royalties were set as low as possible (10%) to encourage collectors to swap.\nThis piece relies on the hicdex API, changes to the API may break it.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQSCktrESP1qrhFa6wGUv1Mtcb4W3xv5caJFxeETrJNT6", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmekPCe4QKNr6LuzxPWGfFcDb4o6pHPniqQ7YpQTgepLqA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQSCktrESP1qrhFa6wGUv1Mtcb4W3xv5caJFxeETrJNT6", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1PoDdN2oyRyF6DA73zTWAWYhNL4UGr3Egj"], "tags": ["generative", "experiment", "interactive", "webgl", "threejs", "3d"], "extra": {}}
