{"__version": 1, "token_id": 579359, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Mount Tambora", "description": "Mount Tambora, or\u00a0Tomboro, is an active\u00a0stratovolcano\u00a0in West Nusa Tenggara, Sumbawa, Indonesia in one of the\u00a0Lesser Sunda Islands\u00a0of\u00a0Indonesia. It was formed by the active\u00a0subduction zones\u00a0beneath it. Before its\u00a01815 eruption, it was more than 4,300 metres (14,100 feet) high, making it one of the tallest peaks in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\nTambora's 1815 eruption was the largest in recorded human history and the largest of the\u00a0Holocene\u00a0(10,000 years ago to present). The\u00a0magma chamber\u00a0under Tambora had been drained by previous eruptions and underwent several centuries of\u00a0dormancy\u00a0as it refilled. Volcanic activity reached a peak that year, culminating in an explosive eruption. The explosion was heard on\u00a0Sumatra\u00a0island, more than 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) away.\n\nHeavy\u00a0volcanic ash\u00a0rains were observed as far away as\u00a0Borneo,\u00a0Sulawesi,\u00a0Java, and\u00a0Maluku islands, and the maximum elevation of Tambora was reduced from about 4,300 metres (14,100\u00a0ft) to 2,850 metres (9,350 feet). Although estimates vary, the death toll was at least 71,000 people.[3]\u00a0The eruption contributed to global\u00a0climate\u00a0anomalies in the following years, while 1816 became known as the \"year without a summer\" because of the impact on North American and European weather. In the\u00a0Northern Hemisphere, crops failed and livestock died, resulting in the worst famine of the century.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWjEuuRUKc9Twqp7982hJH5fYS3x1CTJmqqMkrDtohZAR", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNqGTpNfGFCNe8CpkJ3xrGH5hxwwuRwfjVAUsgE27dUck", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/jpeg", "uri": "ipfs://QmWjEuuRUKc9Twqp7982hJH5fYS3x1CTJmqqMkrDtohZAR"}], "creators": ["tz1QanVS6UuVLHoto85pwUnGBFnxjPPLvLrV"], "tags": ["Mountain", "Tambora", "aerial", "nature", "adventure", "indonesia"], "extra": {}}
