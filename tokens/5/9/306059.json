This allows us to keep our site up, continue to build our ever growing collection of NFTs to be permanently archived, and helps fund the future plans of this ambitious and experimental project.\n\nThe Golden Gather Foundation Supporter Plant is the more rare and elusive version of our original supporter plant. Your support is more valuable to us than tangible gold. \n\nIn the future we wish for all of our NFTs to have utility and we want to give back to those who give to us. This creates an endless cycle of giving and receiving between our foundation and the community.\n\nThank you all artists, collectors, and readers who have already shown tremendous support in this brand new informational project.\n\nwww.gather.foundation", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdA2b1w15NS4eXwPoAQXPnAcigQU3TUEc4QNBXBDWLpMF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdA2b1w15NS4eXwPoAQXPnAcigQU3TUEc4QNBXBDWLpMF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdA2b1w15NS4eXwPoAQXPnAcigQU3TUEc4QNBXBDWLpMF", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1YEYsb7nCUZXvVmGe3KDUECc7TR8DE8QUd"], "tags": ["gold", "golden", "gather", "gatherart", "art", "plant", "nature", "gif", "loop", "lofi", "support", "donate", "news", "celebrate", "rare"], "extra": {}}
