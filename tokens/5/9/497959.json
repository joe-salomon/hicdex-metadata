She is the person who stopped seeking, wondering, listening. And so she is the person who would fall again, and again and again, in and out of light, like so many times before. She was me. \n \nI'm in the light again (much to thanks to psychedelics) and I\u2019m constantly reminding myself to seek, to wonder, to listen. My first NFT represents my past and acts as a reminder to never take your light for granted. Own a piece of my history, my essence, as we venture on to greater and even more surreal things in the future. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZBprdFxGw9wHUret1NmBRjp7TpFXB3RQwdK5MDwEJCHB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdTHyvbcukiL4Kv6rA7P34FCWQFYAHzJsycz2PE8SiCAD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZBprdFxGw9wHUret1NmBRjp7TpFXB3RQwdK5MDwEJCHB", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1em6mGWbZK7T5zJk7CLKqGRgyBD8oCF4tr"], "tags": ["digitalart", "illustration", "surreal", "psychonaut", "mentalhealth", "digitalpainting", "mentalhealth", "experimental", "weird"], "extra": {}}
