You will be shown a direction.\n\nThere\u2019s a force or a mass within you which will be headed in the way that is the easiest and most natural for you. In this image which way do you think this creature is going to go? It has three \noptions, it could go backwards, that would clearly take a lot of energy to get everything rolling back up that way. It could go upwards, again the amount of force that would be needed to do this would involve a lot of muscle clenching. It\u2019s clear which one is going to take the least amount of energy and therefore be the most natural direction for it. Not only will it use the energy of its own mass to propel it forward with ease but also it will be using the environment, the naturally occurring force of gravity to allow the flow and choice of its direction. Feel inward to know what\u2019s right for you and check on the outside what can help.\n\nBe aware, listen and move\nRoll onwards with ease \n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc42eJhxY8HhBjS7nXvKKhy6VPqZpTSBABoJ22k1chuSy", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPEcTHo9E7f5KrRFydhoMmr5THnZWm11kyzD14FGRezXg", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc42eJhxY8HhBjS7nXvKKhy6VPqZpTSBABoJ22k1chuSy", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["illustration", "collectable", "generativeart", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "p5js", "aevin", "maiamellier", "oraclecards", "cards"], "extra": {}}
