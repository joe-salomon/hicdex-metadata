Each have original game art from SLF. All NFTs will be minted between July 14 and August 14, 2021. Your job is to find them all and claim them. If you are reading this message you've already found one.\n\nNFTS:\n\nMuseum Lobby (50x)*\nMuseum Lobby [Gold Edition] (5x)\nGenesis Exhibit (50x)\nLower Level (25x)\nLower Level [Satoshi's Rave Edition] (5x)\nFountain (14x)\nFountain [Nakamoto's Booty Edition] (1x)\n\n(* denotes an NFT you are currently viewing)\n\nRULES: \n \n(1) Follow @chainofinsight on Twitter. Wait for the August 1st announcement the game has begun.\n(2) Quote Tweet the announcement from @chainofinsight. Include \"I'm hunting for #NFTs but if I find them I won't tell you #StopTheShill\" in your quote tweet.\n(3) Each NFT will have 1 or more passwords. Instructions for each password will be clear once you find an NFT or its contract.\n(4) To claim your free NFT, reserve it by responding to the August 1st announcement Tweet from @chainofinsight. Your response must include the $ID of the NFT and an unused password.\n(5) Each password for an edition can be claimed only once.\n(6) Each NFT can be claimed once per Twitter account.\n(7) Each NFT edition can receive only 1 claim per hour.\n(8) Until all winners have been announced if you share content related to the game, beyond interacting with the August 1st announcement Tweet, you will be ineligible to claim any NFTs. Stop the shill!\n(9) If any claiming rules are violated for any line of NFTs, or we suspect foul play, no more claims will be awarded for that edition. All previous claims are still valid. True for all editions EXCEPT Fountain and Fountain [Nakamoto's Booty Edition] which flow like Eldorado and cannot be stopped.\n(10) Winners will be announced, and receive NFTs on, or before, September 10, 2021. Remaining NFTs will be sold with price floor determined by how many times it was claimed. Easier passwords will be cheap, but the reverse will be true for rarely or unclaimed editions.\n\nABOUT SATOSHI'S LOST FAUCET:\n\nSatoshi's Lost Faucet was Chain of Insight's first puzzle game.
