What was born was not a physical form as we are today. What is born again is the soul of the person who then takes a certain form according to the results of his previous actions. There are two main schools, namely, first, those who believe that humans will continue to be born again. Second, those who believe that humans will cease to be reborn at some point when they do sufficient good or when they attain supreme consciousness (Nirvana) or become one with God (moksha). Hinduism adheres to the second sect.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTKX2tCu69eVbWwBYRXLoPKjN6xbt12rT3oMip83MBcjx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZCZEjR2QP7tWrEpomCHQXMXDzXRsn8oFNhzHWDpMEiwf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmfS8yNhe9HXTSwP8aaA9aW8DKijwPQTa3VEeE4MzXrDPs", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTKX2tCu69eVbWwBYRXLoPKjN6xbt12rT3oMip83MBcjx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1M7CcoivmnB24tPBMPm1eSHichJgDjRPgh"], "tags": ["illustration", "digitalart", "cryptoart", "nft", "nftshill", "nftcommunity", "nftart", "objkt", "nftdrop", "ifrgtmyname"], "extra": {}}
