Historical painting where the first personal computer desktop is the subject.\n\nThe overlapping windows were an important part of the user interface design of the first Macintosh, first introduced on the Lisa in 1983. Neither the Alto Star nor the first version of Windows could overlap windows or other UI elements. (But the Alto prototype could). It was possible thanks to clever redraw routines and the region data structure.\n\nYou can learn more about it here: https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=I_Still_Remember_Regions.txt&topic=QuickDraw\n\nThe microdesktop series is inspired by the black and white interface of the first Macintosh in 1984 and its small 512 \u00d7 342 pixels, black and white (no greys), 9\" screen.\n\nDesigner and artists had to use every pixels and find ways around the limitations, leading to beautiful 1-bit icons, backgrounds and illustrations.\n\nThe original resolution of this piece is 10 times smaller than the original Macintosh desktop at 51 \u00d7 34 pixels only. The actual final image file is scaled up 8 times, to be visible on modern computers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUax71tPWCUb8cf1m1iRSPEtsjHaVN4GmX4o5Sfoypiqa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUax71tPWCUb8cf1m1iRSPEtsjHaVN4GmX4o5Sfoypiqa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUax71tPWCUb8cf1m1iRSPEtsjHaVN4GmX4o5Sfoypiqa", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VhN58tCJbboQQoyTgLWoCwDUXBidfcAgd"], "tags": ["microdesktop", "computer", "blackandwhite", "history", "1bit", "icons", "80s", "pixelart", "macintoshb&w", "lowres", "interface", "1984", "pixel"], "extra": {}}
