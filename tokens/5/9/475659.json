{"__version": 1, "token_id": 475659, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Train No.118", "description": "We both are familiar with train trips, whether it\u2019s for vacation or some simple commuting. Though, it\u2019s quite a rare occasion to enjoy a quiet private journey with no other people on our sides. When the train started to move, things almost slowly became silent. As each and everyone of us deals with our own stories and reasons, some of us might find a revelation about how enlightening a trip can become. \n\nWith this track, we wanted to capture the feelings we felt during those moments. Moments where we are so lost within ourselves in a journey full with people we don\u2019t know. A mysterious feeling that can either wrench a well-hidden emotion out to relief, or comforting the mind with imaginations about good things to come. \n\nEveryone might not felt the same thing. We can only hope that this track can help you feel the quiet contemplative joy of romanticizing your own journey.\n\nArtist: Jemala \nTitle: Train No.118\nFormat: 44,1Khz 16bit Stereo WAV File\nDuration: 01:18", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdprKUiV68N9kvseBZJcvUeXxG7Z4mrcBUfUET73Eu2Ho", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUNbFj3AGeePhwYSmC6fcXumffypKw7A3ogEvJwcRuWr8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdprKUiV68N9kvseBZJcvUeXxG7Z4mrcBUfUET73Eu2Ho", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz2Ptv8gJFbPDZXMiNiJ9DMpt6tZMJyjJ9Fa"], "tags": ["henradio", "audiovisual", "indie-folk", "henmusic", "audionft", "jemala", "ambient", "folk", "nftune", "hicetnuncmusic", "nftunes", "nftfilm", "nftaudio", "nftsound", "audio", "contemplative", "meditative", "cinematic", "acoustic", "indonesianmusician", "hicetnuncaudio", "indonesia", "mp3"], "extra": {}}
