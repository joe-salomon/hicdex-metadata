We are machines and the machine is within us. The machine breathes.\u201d (Dyens, Metal and Flesh)  \n\nWe are confined to the world of numbers. 0101010101 ... Our century is the century of the disappearance of mankind. Computers are penetrating our flesh, skin and bones. The meaning of beauty is no longer like any of the previous centuries. We are merging with the computer. We are sinking into it and becoming one with it. The real world we knew is becoming less and less dominant in the virtual world. We lose our faces. We lose our voices. Hugs and kisses have lost their meanings. We lose our bodies. And our flesh and skin become lights. We are quietly and gradually interacting with robots. Iron legs and arms are connected, and our meat is tied to iron. We are settling into this new world, and we may not soon remember where we came from and what we were. We will forget nature. We will forget our true selves. We will forget so much that we will not remember the fear and uncanny of this writing.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbyYBQqPXpF6NnXEMR9oP4zgPPcKuNZqD3o6TnRZEaPuM", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf6sszeacuhDj3gxaUSgu5yF4iUQziGpifwJMxYex8L8K", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbyYBQqPXpF6NnXEMR9oP4zgPPcKuNZqD3o6TnRZEaPuM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gPp35sdpCUQwiGAURhTAEYwaF8itxW11v"], "tags": ["#outside", "#nftillustration", "#hicetnunce2000", "#illustration", "#nftc", "#nftillustrator", "#nftcommunitY", "#cleannfts", "#nft", "#tezosnft", "#tezosart", "#nftart", "#hen", "#nftcollectors", "#nftcollection", "#hicetnunc", "#inside", "#robot", "#monaliza", "#computer", "#inside", "#sabasart", "#bot", "#01", ""], "extra": {}}
