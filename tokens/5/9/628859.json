Part of the Feathered Tales and Hybrid Mythology universe. \n\nBirds appear in legends and myths of most cultures, often representing different archetypical characters or possessing special powers. Possibly the ability to fly of the creatures who lived so close to us throughout history has fascinated humans across the world. For me personally birds are deeply fascinating creatures and they are many times featured in my work. This Hybrid Mythology piece is a visual play and intuitive representation of the mythical birds with the ability to shapeshift and transmute.
