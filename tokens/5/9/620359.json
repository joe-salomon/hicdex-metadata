I'm still in love with the pic and the incredibly comfy and quiet place, so I thought that it would be nice to share it with all my NFT holders. Would like to take more photos like this more often...\n\nYup, I know this is not any drawing/animation (sorry), but will try my best to come back with fresh new art this 2022. Thank you all so much for your support~", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeSi7LvyfEnF61qQFK9U4p4DShfik4Tf8WEy4NePxwZdW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVpSwkMxooeqVvfQ8hBv93xyEnq89xcmEB9vw8NBksYHh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeSi7LvyfEnF61qQFK9U4p4DShfik4Tf8WEy4NePxwZdW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bpHDtz8T7Xiv4hFEbfh8gKDCYLgxog8AU"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "forest", "gift"], "extra": {}}
