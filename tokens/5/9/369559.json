I wanted to make the first one as impactful as possible. Prior to starting this subset of a series within the main sequence of images, I tried to find words that had the highest level of plasticity or adaptability. What in the name of the good book does that mean Andrew? Fantastic question. When on the hunt for a word with high adaptability, we need to focus on extremely popular words with popular letters because we need the greatest possibility that these letters will yield as many results. So far so good, right? There's also another factor to think of, length. The length of the word will dictate also how many other words can be mutated into variants. In this case, I chose THIS. No, really the word THIS. It's a frequently used word, has fairly popular letters, and not too long that it limits the word yield. So then we peer at the variants and begin to sift through words to build our artwork. In THIS case, (ha nice pun there) we have the following permutations: THIS/SITH/SHIT/HITS/HIST. So from this list the most interesting and timeless collection of words that can create a narrative of sorts would be, THIS SHIT HITS. SITH and HIST would be superfluous, unnecessary and actually would take away from the rule of 3's as balance. You say more with less, so the eyes can focus on a few words centered in the space and the conversation can begin between you and the art. But is this art Andrew? That's for you to decide.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmY6wDVAhNVZiDDvzqd7gVuHW6XvrE6tKdDMLgxy6HAdQx", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbusEeniNXv9oiQRn56bgkEMJbL2DS6dhZtxnXgwJgTYu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmY6wDVAhNVZiDDvzqd7gVuHW6XvrE6tKdDMLgxy6HAdQx", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
