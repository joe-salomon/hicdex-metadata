Preheat oven to 350 degrees F\n\n2. Use a food processor to blend all ingredients until well combined. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides to make sure everything is well incorporated. \n\n3. Place mixture on a baking sheet - I used a silpat nonstick baking mat to help with flipping and avoiding any issues with sticking. \n\n4. Use a baking spatula, or your hands to flatten cracker to desired thickness. ~1/4\" thick is what I typically do.\n\n5. Use a pizza cutter or a sharp knife (be careful not to cut your silpat if using one!) to cut into desired size and shape crackers.\n\n6. At ~1/4\" thickness bake for 10 min and then, flip and cook for another ~25 min. See pictures in recipe using QR code.\n\nChecking periodically until you reach your desired texture- removing the crisped 'quackers' as they bake to avoid over cooking them. \nNOTE*** Using a dehydrator is a great option, if you have one!\n\nServe them up with any dish you would like to add a side of crunch with! \n\nIn my opinion, these are the best served straight out of the oven. They are not very good the next day as they get a bit soft because of the chia seeds. The thinner they are the more potential they have for being good crunchy 'leftovers.' I juice every day so I have fresh pulp to make new ones as desired.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdaiyk98jgsNiRmwsXZcvbaZkFPnUYnMNcKc7uZUYUiYA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbVKoDwcQsDRYUT9xzgESk9dSUzSREUo61ynkvcgeKhH7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdaiyk98jgsNiRmwsXZcvbaZkFPnUYnMNcKc7uZUYUiYA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hU3XG444nNcSLZyoPwC6LeVndYnMYZML6"], "tags": ["raw", "juicepulp", "green", "cracker", "recipe", "recipenfts", "food", "vegan", "plantbased", "akala", "recipes", "hen.recipes"], "extra": {}}
