It's difficult to tell; I see some heads turned sideways over there on the right. We're almost through the boomerang letter group part. I promise, just hold on. Just like in painting, music, sculpture or any kind of art form that matter...there's always playing with the negative space as mentioned in a previous image. This one happens to take it to the next level; inception style. I really love the negative space so much of these that I did one about negative space, no really the words negative space. Kinda meta right? Ughhh this is what I love about the English language. Can you see it or am I just nuts. Probably a little bit of both to be candid. Whew...the commentary is shorter and shorter...what a relief.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmds9xmua7RUgpaKWsrXDoqiGUTNckTDKxcwFVqX7puXcE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcR196gZgA4jbwM2Ns8bTMo49uKKYo7wyKCKG1hPRYG15", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmds9xmua7RUgpaKWsrXDoqiGUTNckTDKxcwFVqX7puXcE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
