{"__version": 1, "token_id": 489259, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Samhain Table of Keys", "description": "The names of 13 spirits are selected at random from a pantheon of 100 gods, deities, angels, demons and egregores. Four runic and  nine sigil representations are drawn representing each spirit.\n\nIf the entities selected from the pantheon are not to you liking, you can select a different set of 13 spirits with a mouse click or on touchscreen devices with a touch. \n\nIf the table were to be used in ritual, as the magickian would have limited control over which spirits they consort with, the resulting magickal works would be extremely powerful and effective. It is NOT recommended to use this obkt in ritual, even if highly advanced in the protective rites.\n\nThis objkt can grant wishes, but that comes at a price.\n\nWARNING: Do not use in ritual. This objkt is ended for entertainment and aesthetic purposes only. Ownership is at the collector's own risk.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaEHNoJrq6uQ3w678kCUhAvXxv5ovAfWYkTWUnp7K6DMa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP6f59aQj2hNT2NTp2i8ERXa4gD5BmieREu4Z9eomFAkY", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaEHNoJrq6uQ3w678kCUhAvXxv5ovAfWYkTWUnp7K6DMa", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1iejkdRYyq7WdVtrXgpq1dtazsGpthkF1U"], "tags": ["henhalloween", "henoween", "halloween", "abstract", "abstractart", "occult", "generative", "generativeart", "sigils", "chaosmagick", "magick", "magicksquares", "runes", "cipher", "cipherart"], "extra": {}}
