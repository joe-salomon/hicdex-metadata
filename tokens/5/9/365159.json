Stepping inside a different world was feeling strange, she was a she but felt like he! I was scared but I was strong enough to handle it. It took me a while to understand her different world. It was all about her, showing the real Her! a girl who dressed like a boy, a tomboy. But now I know her/him/she/he are just some labels we relate to people and actually, these name tags aren\u2019t even real. So, to those days I called her \u201cHer\u201d, it is the name of art!\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPxgxubFcw83KRCYt3Jo9nFXrYUwzKobJoo4iW76EC24x", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTBERUoDgfmp6pGgf3PkbmbwJf5khLg5Fh9yEr1Lj7nLQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPxgxubFcw83KRCYt3Jo9nFXrYUwzKobJoo4iW76EC24x", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WsQpkEUYk4i6KCJA3LfWtqcZgXQLfqjfT"], "tags": ["her", "girl", "boy", "tomboy", "blackandwhitephotography", "photography", "blackandwhite", "fineart", "fineartphotography"], "extra": {}}
