A breeze, the ocean, clouds, sky, sand, patterned insects, feathers, leaves, petals and flowers are just some of the textures that inspired this series. \n\nWhen we enter a forest or dive into the ocean we're enveloped by a system of natural forces and the mathematical equations that drive them. Colours and patterns in nature can engender a positive biological response in humans. These 'biophilic design patterns' have been well documented in fields as diverse as biology, neuroscience and architecture. \n\nWhen we look at a tree we see an arrangement of beautiful branches, leaves and flowers - we are drawn to its complexity whether we fully understand how it was created or not. Yet we know on some level that the \u2018system\u2019 that created the tree, created us. And much like the distributed and interconnected patterns of nature, these artworks too will be immortalised on the blockchain's digital distributed network forever.\n\nPandorea imagines a world where, through technology, we might be able to recreate the feeling that one might experience whilst being in nature. \n\n2000 x 2000 pixels made with love.
