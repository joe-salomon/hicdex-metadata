And we were able to perform this beautiful action, buying food for residents of the Santo Amaro Favela who needed it.\n\nSince then, I've been shielding myself from all sides, because the case hasn't been finalized yet. We don't know if this was the case with a physical or digital attack. The move performed on transactions does not indicate a robotic move. The stolen money is still in the ghost wallet created only for the theft, and from what seems the person has not yet withdrawn.\n\nTogether with friends we went looking for evidence and concluded that the best thing to do would be for me to start over and improve my security methods more and more. This event somehow shook me, but once again the community supported me and sent strength!\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS7hpZLrTjt1eZeZNf7KEvudKjbe4Saw7S8NyRJUjUpgX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVq4LVADHumx4GHXKxfWPCd6Ru9BmdmHrRcoaQRUJUwfr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS7hpZLrTjt1eZeZNf7KEvudKjbe4Saw7S8NyRJUjUpgX", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1T2Wi3EHATBq1TD7oq7SQJQjvnfXFUEF1v"], "tags": ["xtz", "nfts", "hen", "cleannft", "econft", "tezos", "hicetnunc", "favela", "safety", "cadeado", "seguran\u00e7a"], "extra": {}}
