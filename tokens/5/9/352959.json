My book is progressing better than before, and I guess I owe that to multiple things. Finally moving out on my own, finally feeling a bit more myself, and finally feeling like I'm more in control. These journal pages have helped a lot too. When I was younger, I would write stream-of-conscious all the time with all of my work. Any story, journal, assignment, would all be free-flowing. I knew how to trust my thoughts then. It's different now that I pursued a writing degree. Now my thoughts get in the way of each other, the freeform against the structured. I edit more than I write now, but I'm working on it, and I think I'm getting better. I've found that the more control I have over my life, the less control I exert over my writing. Isn't that strange?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPNGZghyp6cfdbAsMntnSggcA165cM3HQ2X7HQcdTaAf3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmajPGQn8zQ3XfperJ4MaR9sRwgnphAbTk8nhNGpU6AXDT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPNGZghyp6cfdbAsMntnSggcA165cM3HQ2X7HQcdTaAf3", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Rn339EyYkX4ygVtZ61XpLTBe5hikvFUa7"], "tags": ["visiblethoughts", "series", "collection", "nft", "writing", "nftwriting", "journal", "calligraphy", "handwriting", "nftgirl", "cryptoart", "words", "wordart", "scrapbook", "collage", "trending", "different", "nfts", "hen", "henart"], "extra": {}}
