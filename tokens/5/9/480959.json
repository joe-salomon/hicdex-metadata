Every break is unique and instead of repairing an item like new, the 400-year-old technique actually highlights the \"scars\" as a part of the design. Using this as a metaphor for healing ourselves teaches us an important lesson: Sometimes in the process of repairing things that have broken, we actually create something more unique, beautiful and resilient.\n\n\n-\nFrom the \"Bowl Head\" Collection. \n\nThis collection is fine art based on Character design & Abstract style.\n\n\n\n\n-", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXQKxaJXsZe3dVHnmnkBuy83j7K8pXQjtor35nvcd69u4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYT79unSZbpBYy2RdqNjg9iaP25ywRq1KoahE3SjKU4et", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXQKxaJXsZe3dVHnmnkBuy83j7K8pXQjtor35nvcd69u4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["3dart", "bowlhead", "cryptoart", "3d", "magical", "dope", "rare", "character", "fineart", "stars", "space", "japanian", "japan", "kintsugi", "gold", "asia", "eastern"], "extra": {}}
