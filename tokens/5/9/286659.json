The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap, low-grade paper called newsprint). However, today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for merchants. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeifx7jdw3xazjapgyujkgt43uo2xstrq5tq7dhcblhziwnh6iux2zq", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreieqnirznmhrgsjvpytgillz2fnnnrmwoxuu4occ45syuevxg7pmeu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeifx7jdw3xazjapgyujkgt43uo2xstrq5tq7dhcblhziwnh6iux2zq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dKSzfeHMb9xXSJWioRQ4a7iCCd4KgF8LM"], "tags": ["NFT", "digital", "Photography", "Black&White", "CriminalMayhem", "RiccardoFortunato", "Surreal", "Art", "Contemporary"], "extra": {}}
