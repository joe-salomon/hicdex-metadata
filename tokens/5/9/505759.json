{"__version": 1, "token_id": 505759, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Angelcat and Friends Collection \u2013 Cheonsa Cat", "description": "Angel Cat and Friends is about Cheonsa the Cat, an angel cat sent to earth to help fellow animals do good deeds. To disguise herself and do her mission, Cheonsa runs Coffee Cat, a caf\u00e9 that caters to all animals in town. Her most frequent customers are Danny Dog, Rita Rabbit, Paulie Penguin, Chase Chick, Owen Owl and Barry Bear. Each of them has his/her own likes and dislikes as well as good and bad traits. With her yummy food and drinks, little pieces of advice and some help with their needs, Cheonsa inspires them to become better versions of themselves. This NFT is about Cheonsa Cat.\n\nCheonsa Cat is actually a white angel cat with blue wings. However, to disguise herself on earth, she becomes an orange cat without wings. Cheonsa can do pretty much anything she puts her mind into (probably because she\u2019s an angel cat in the Animal Paradise Secret Service). She\u2019s good in sports, music, arts, and even cooking and baking! She became a caf\u00e9 owner on earth to meet a lot of animals who may need her help. She has magical powers to help her do that, but let's keep it a secret for now, shall we? ;-)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ5t8iDtcd5TqcCVCmyJmSKwht4JC9shxRwCG4yNFoskd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZ5t8iDtcd5TqcCVCmyJmSKwht4JC9shxRwCG4yNFoskd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ5t8iDtcd5TqcCVCmyJmSKwht4JC9shxRwCG4yNFoskd", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QDfxJj5XEpGdnJMEbDYJLMUkpZiHiTUGQ"], "tags": ["collection", "collectibles", "gif", "character", "cute", "animals", "animated", "cartoon", "image", "animatedgif", "cat", "meow", "kitten", "kitty", "cafe", "magic", "angel", ""], "extra": {}}
