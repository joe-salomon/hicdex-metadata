They are hot, uncomfortable, and depending on how much you sweat, they often didn't make it the entire day intact. My wife eventually joined in the fun and we even won a Halloween costume contest wearing our Zombie Box Hero Suits. So despite winning, and the fact that I can't actually see her face... I'm not sure if this bird is serious or sarcastic.
