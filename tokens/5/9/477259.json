{"__version": 1, "token_id": 477259, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SST_BW-01", "description": "v4W.ENko - \"SST_BW-01\". The Black&White  representation of the \"SUBSTRATE STONE TOWER\"  pattern realized in 3d. The variation of the structure is parametrized in different layers of dataflow and is represented visually in animation. Diffrent random seed and various numbers of cells are making difference in the total structure and  holding the same character. The camera is moving around the sides. The patern is alive and changes the hierarchy with each step of frame.\n Tops of the towers are grown from the 210 cells of \"substrate\" with 3d extrusion of  random seed 1888. The base plane is intersected with towers and moving as dark sections in between the base and tops.  Packed as GIF. 1024*1024px / 180 frames.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX43ETythLb6Pv1wvoChEuxzTkzdQgjSRWbMYUEt9nvch", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX43ETythLb6Pv1wvoChEuxzTkzdQgjSRWbMYUEt9nvch", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX43ETythLb6Pv1wvoChEuxzTkzdQgjSRWbMYUEt9nvch", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Mpr7WD3UG47UFPbizLPnBCNhh8pcdbSyz"], "tags": ["v4w.enko", "substrate", "algorithm", "generative", "art", "digital", "abstract", "3d", "gif", "decentraland", "cryptovoxels", "parametric", "grayscale", "monochrome", "blackandwhite", "quadro", "perspective", "projection", "pattern", "HENHALLOWEEN"], "extra": {}}
