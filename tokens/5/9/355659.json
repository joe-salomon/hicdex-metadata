I named this shot after the book of the great author Haruki Murakami.\nFor those who know the book might know that loneliness and and unsolved problems within relationships are big topics in it. I was reading that book during the time I was living in Tokyo and suddenly this beautiful city was showing  different sides to me. This shot always awakens that feeling for me. Even tho it has a slightly sad touch to it, it serves me to be reminded in a more round and complete view on my time back in Tokyo.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdp9Z6zzBX8xKW7gFguXWEPPJrpYjwsAgGaWPZGWLdjbn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXGd31J7BN2Ji1PRXZzetH6xU6pKZ2MCa1ZmUDMAQdaYa", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdp9Z6zzBX8xKW7gFguXWEPPJrpYjwsAgGaWPZGWLdjbn", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LmYvjoTwJL6n6GZJWPEwEix6Qg3C9JJQM"], "tags": ["35mm", "Tokyo", "analogphotography", "neonlights", "city", "Shibuya", "metro", ""], "extra": {}}
