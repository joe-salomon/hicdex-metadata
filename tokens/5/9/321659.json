He wrote a lot of timeless songs for various singers of yesteryear; Nat King Cole being one of his most famous clients. This very quote began my entire emotional and intellectual journey towards the long arm of truth and discovery. Eden was a self-proclaimed hippy back in the 1940s, way before Woodstock. Incredibly, he and his family for a time lived beneath the Hollywood sign. He was so counterculture, that he was counter culture before there was even the concept of a counter culture. The lyrics and melody of this song are so deeply resonating that they transport you to another time, another place, another life. It speaks of slowing down and observing the world, observing yourself in the world, and observing the universe that we live within. His cadence, his confidence, his poetry, his style, his wisdom were something that seemed absolutely intoxicating and wanted to emulate or become. I knew after listening to this song...this was who I am at heart; a curious human who observes, interprets, and feels everything; an artist.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNb8Y4XUeUu9MMAU11yeMadSCoorVeCG9Ym6gS4gtqhPq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTLreqGTMDhmZREhwoEZNcuK7wWzoBM9Fpu2UHxk7sZKQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNb8Y4XUeUu9MMAU11yeMadSCoorVeCG9Ym6gS4gtqhPq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["concretepoetry", "poetry", "digitalart", "nft", "digital", "visualart", "art", "nftartist", "nftart", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "conceptualart", ""], "extra": {}}
