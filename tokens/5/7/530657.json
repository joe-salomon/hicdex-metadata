It's got great little details like the circular windows and a spiral staircase at the back. The side of the building shares a friendly picnic area where guests from the general store eat their lunches. I was really struck by the shadow cast by the line of trees onto the building and got a rush painting them. After being so meticulous about the building it was a tense moment when I had to paint the shadow shape in boldly over all of the work. I just braced myself and went for it!  How do you stay calm under pressure?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfWGUr4pdtnJKPXyX8vBFBeF35QNHHYft34AtKTeDES9G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYMyWR72kj1fuUtZdtQMf9wZjeVYbRvpb7GNEqQFoFGxS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfWGUr4pdtnJKPXyX8vBFBeF35QNHHYft34AtKTeDES9G", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PZkXWySiVHPBwJo7yaNS1ycz8qZSkUuvd"], "tags": ["art", "watercolor", "painting", "traditional", "fumansiu", "postoffice"], "extra": {}}
