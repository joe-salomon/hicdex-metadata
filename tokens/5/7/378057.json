{"__version": 1, "token_id": 378057, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "NOTHING RHYMES WITH NOTHING", "description": "This is an example of a contradictory sentence in English. It is both a true and false statement. The word NOTHING has no other \"DIRECT\" rhyming words. What in the world does that mean Andrew? Well, rhyming is a communication in audible sounds of units of composition or utterance (such as two or more words or lines of verse). An example: BOY/TOY/JOY. Now, there are other things called near rhymes or slant rhymes that don't directly rhyme. They rhyme the last consonants of a word, but not the vowels or initial consonants. Example: CLIMB/THUMB. But Andrew, there are words that rhyme with NOTHING, like SOMETHING/DANCING/ANYTHING or even BUFFING. True, but there are no words like BOY/TOY/JOY/ANNOY that rhyme with NOTHING. (cue the crickets...) Yes, this is a rhyming loophole, but it is true that nothing directly rhymes with NOTHING. So, by saying nothing rhymes with NOTHING, this is a true statement. The false statement would be saying the word NOTHING, actually rhymes with itself. But Andrew, couldn't you technically rhyme something with itself? Yes, if there are different meanings for that word, but in this case I'm pretty sure nothing will self rhyme with nothing.
