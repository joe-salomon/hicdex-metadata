How often do we have something within us that is below the surface wanting to come out but we suppress it out of fear? This energy was a birth for me into finding my own creative voice, trusting and flowing with it.This is part of a series exploring the disturbance. This image is the full artwork and whoever buys this is entitled to the real world artwork, shipped anywhere in the world. I will also be releasing 1 of \"prints\" of close up details of this work and the other parts of the series. This is my first NFT.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7Dywa31aewvEhffA4WbE9ZjtBxE9uEhx2a9XjJtWtPd", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcdk45Sm5WHy43KAH5ibKsS4XpyFf5mN7UmG6WWLbNgjM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf7Dywa31aewvEhffA4WbE9ZjtBxE9uEhx2a9XjJtWtPd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1RQDqPNMfkyPFBf1reFu4oPw2zewBa4a2j"], "tags": ["art", "wood", "acrylic", "painting", "woodwork", "abstract"], "extra": {}}
