Find everything that is that color in your house and take a picture.\u201d (Original post in my story)\n\nI loved the idea and brought it to my partner, who responded with what I\u2019d been thinking, \u201cWhy not do all of the colors of the rainbow?\u201d So we wrote down all the colors on slips of paper, threw them in a hat, and picked our first color. It was blue. Our second was red.\n\nFor this shoot, I opted for an outdoor setting in our yard. We live on a corner lot surrounded by three-story apartment buildings and shielded by very few trees, so the neighborhood got a fun show this afternoon. I choose to move the shoot outdoors when I found a bundle of yellow smoke bombs in my things and realized we needed to incorporate them. While they may have been small yellow balls, their impact on the finished photo was largest of all the things. \n\nIt's too bad the school bus we bought, which is sitting in the background, had been painted over with gray, but that's okay, we had enough to work with. Including a bumblebee costume, because why not? \n\nPart of an ongoing series exploring all of the stuff we collect color by color, through the rainbow.
