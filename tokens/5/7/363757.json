She is proficient in playing a musical instrument (shizu learns from it) and is a top-class artist in disguise. In her action as a ninja, Ayaka is very fast as well as tough. She is an expert in explosives and traps. She is a good friend to Rokuro, and has a calm nature like hime. She is often seen together with rokuro and of course, Shizu. Shizu really idolizes Ayaka and even Shizu once almost thwarted an important mission with her carelessness, but Ayaka, who is smart and cunning, makes this not happen.
