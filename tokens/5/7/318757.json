I remember even having dreams at night, of having ankles exactly like theirs, only to wake up with a heart sunken from disappointment. But then you grow up, and perception changes. My ankles are not thin, but they get me to walk, to run, to dance. And just for that, they deserve all the love in the world. \n\nTechnique: digital painting.\nSize: 1668 x 2388 px\nType: image/jpeg\nDate: 03/05/2021", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZLKuhwUa5zTvBtR3QanJjzj2SaWRZm5VxQeUL2BpqvQL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYq3A6HESFeZy4Kcaic2hPRDr4KT39Zz96RMKWz62EHDs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZLKuhwUa5zTvBtR3QanJjzj2SaWRZm5VxQeUL2BpqvQL", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1R8kMjNUCAN2xfnBGBYq5egQPvVLBfhoaF"], "tags": ["selflove", "fineart", "self-love", "bodydysmorphia", "body", "bodypositivity"], "extra": {}}
