The end of our Suns life characterised by a Supernova event will push humans in search of other habitable systems.  We will be leaving the local system in the next series to explore other interesting and unique collections of planets, systems and never before seen spacial objects which will blow your mind. \n\nAs you now know I arrived from the Galaxy GN-z11 to visit planet \u201cEarth\u201d .
