It felt like it was disconnected from time, with the front yard having a few patches of dead grasses & weeds and mostly dirt, and all the other houses around it seeming way more alive or normal, per se; like the cliche strange house found in a typical neighborhood that looked like it could be haunted or be housing witches.\n\nAs with the mirror, it was only later when I looked over the pictures that I realized just how on point that spot was to my intention, seeing how as I was looking around, I was also being peered at through the looking glass.\n\nIn this image, I also hid my signature more than a few times as almost like a \"Where's Waldo\" watermark.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQE8XZWHXHv77Fk94cxuL1Y2ZBuUCUrB9jc3tWMz1YqXd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVRUnHvnBdizkz9m8SAoj43Ba24KTBvEDpk4V5yRvWFts", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQE8XZWHXHv77Fk94cxuL1Y2ZBuUCUrB9jc3tWMz1YqXd", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1X23H5uFW98v6fpk93Vd5uhmUBz72B8Awq"], "tags": ["intention", "magic", "Randonautica", "timeless", "space", "odd", "strange", "thelookingglass", "throughthelookingglass", "wonderland", "photography"], "extra": {}}
