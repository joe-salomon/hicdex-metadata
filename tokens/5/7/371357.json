As long as you are.\nThe sinister look that you always felt on your back, now spreads throughout your room. It gazes you. As long as you gaze.\nIt is waiting for the right moment.\n\nThis is a special mint. The purpose of The Gaze is not to be collected, but to be passed to as much people as it's possible. To gaze and be gazed. To be cursed and curse.\nLet it spread as a disease that can't be cured.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZtKssWznXYqqeVaYSGLCXwnU76LeBZFAnyTeddVnX8fq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZtKssWznXYqqeVaYSGLCXwnU76LeBZFAnyTeddVnX8fq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZtKssWznXYqqeVaYSGLCXwnU76LeBZFAnyTeddVnX8fq", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1eiYuohbae4tvG7vJLMHdKRMSoeHA2Ub46"], "tags": ["watcher", "curse", "virus", "glitch", "rare", "special", "occult"], "extra": {}}
