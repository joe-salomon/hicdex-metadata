The singer explained the song is about an imaginary place where you can escape of various different reasons of anxiety, from feeling of being unloved, past mistakes or simply properly being human.\n\nI discovered this song when Games of Thrones was my favorite show and I am a big fan of Grey Worm character (this one I still do regardless how the show ended). I really resonate with the song and the lyric, I could understand his anxieties myself. Not sure how many times I listened and read the lyrics its just so poetic and I decided to interpret it with illustration. \n\nThe tree is a metaphor of my safe zone, a peaceful state of mind that I can conjure sometimes whenever I need to shelter from malicious anxiety thoughts and the snake slither its way up into the tree\u2019s foliage is my mind. Inside the the tree I can really be myself, relaxed without having to worry about the \u2018outside world / reality\u2019, a place where I can be anything whether its considered good or evil without any judgement. Maybe a place to shed my thoughts so I can be free.\n\nBiggest shout out to Raleigh Ritchie, listen to his music here https://open.spotify.com/track/45qpBT2QsIESr6ol0I35S2?si=2d21f9f9b80c4c86\u2028\u2028", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPnBu5cxy3CheKdzFonKkh6CiEo2aXhvQQM72YT2h4zCQ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbRF3UgpQpioRi9p9YsWYyrzrC6JLMVZv6uCAGCzWsCwH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPnBu5cxy3CheKdzFonKkh6CiEo2aXhvQQM72YT2h4zCQ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2DoRP4a4gFwxuaGwrnG1jNyKmPPynWWUjB"], "tags": ["illustration", "digital", "digitalillustration", "objkt4objkt"], "extra": {}}
