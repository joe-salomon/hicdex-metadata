I visualize humans at war, humans who basically have the ability to think and reason that are far more perfect than animals are now dropping each other, killing each other. each other for the sake of personal interest as if they have no common sense. Cats and mice that do not have perfect sense and are basically hostile to each other here I describe one another and live side by side. Here I hope that we as humans are aware and ashamed to see animals that can live in harmony. hostilities and wars between humans cause children to lose their parents, make them abandoned, lose their future and so on. The window that I described with the ugly condition is a picture of poverty caused by the war. I'm better than animals. With this work, I hope that the young and future generations of the nation will live in harmony and unite so that the things above will never happen like the war I have drawn in a silhouette that I hope will never happen.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQcutL7yGmxWzunMir9KhjksqNgSQ9NQVKQusrnED2iGA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPeLvewjDxanoaP1evxJvn5XdJnQ7cXzPniDSPh6N9w8K", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQcutL7yGmxWzunMir9KhjksqNgSQ9NQVKQusrnED2iGA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2CKzQp1x8REhSva9mi4kVgYiFj7nsqvZgN"], "tags": ["ilustration", "people", "nft", "trend", "painting", "art"], "extra": {}}
