I found out about his photographs already when I was shooting with a Polaroid.\nWhen Patti Smith's book \"Just Kids\" came out, I read it excitedly and from there I learned that my birthday was on the same day that Robert had. \n\nI got up early in the morning and looked at the wilting flowers, which my beloved gave me, I remembered about Robert, and asked Misha to pose for photo with the flowers.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXipH4RQzoj9J44nhw8mhrDcBTnYSAXXK3Nt7wbRHb32X", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZLM32Q6d5tNqvtdYYugbZVKU7wWFusJhKViJVW9DJt9L", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXipH4RQzoj9J44nhw8mhrDcBTnYSAXXK3Nt7wbRHb32X", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d5HE9dWCn6ciiSgLRvfegDiHyMUt6oo4w"], "tags": ["blackandwhite", "polaroid", "polaroiddiary", "halo"], "extra": {}}
