The word seems to be derived from the Greek andragath\u00eda (courage). It has its power structures in Calabria, especially in the capital Reggio Calabria, located in the Strait of Messina. Although it has apparently been around for more than a century, it has only become more visible since the 1950s. The small town of Santa Luca in the Calabria region counts as the \u2018sanctuary\u2019 of gangsters, where the entire population is on the same side.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdkx1sQo5F3v82KGzzzRVGYwCptfBEsjEhjt2cPAwepNS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmX17hJLiUaXQzMSedpPt1axUQrMgviWkv7hzHb2yNkbT4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdkx1sQo5F3v82KGzzzRVGYwCptfBEsjEhjt2cPAwepNS", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1eY9QhsjKiMc39cdvKF5QN6cu5tLTg1EHZ"], "tags": ["Neoexpressionism", "popart", "art", "popart", "expressionism", "drawing", "black", "italian", "history"], "extra": {}}
