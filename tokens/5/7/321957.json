After so many years, the variety and beauty of fractals and the amazing results of combining them never cease to surprise me. Collecting them can be very addictive.\n\n\u201cFractal art is a form of algorithmic art created by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still digital images, animations, and media. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards. It is a genre of computer art and digital art which are part of new media art. The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art. They combine to produce a type of abstract art.\u201d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_art", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRzYWMsxNe9UPjohAnwqvkxN9XgRjB9znNWvFZTuBNPDE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbcSuCgWXirMrefczeGovrbmbXg2Qd718GUgTW4sCwSt9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRzYWMsxNe9UPjohAnwqvkxN9XgRjB9znNWvFZTuBNPDE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2At4Hfz8ShWUJ3DA4r8D7n8G3tzgkJ2TNB"], "tags": ["generative", "fractals"], "extra": {}}
