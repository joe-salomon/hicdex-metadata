These snake-like, winged demons love to emerge from the deepest shadows, snatch their prey, and then pull them back to a safer location. \n\nWhile their mobility makes Shadowbats dangerous foes, they have the strength of an average human, as well as soft, fleshy skin, so the chances of being able to fight one off if captured is much higher than most other demons thus the designation of Creeper level.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZWarJn91rMmsJFonVLyEuMzmMFiDKT1h9X9FLpvipXxb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmenFwJ3pvQJiUX72FZWUghwpGZXSAf7KAV11tQ2DiuizZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZWarJn91rMmsJFonVLyEuMzmMFiDKT1h9X9FLpvipXxb", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["darkwheel", "orderofthedarkwheel", "creeper", "demon", "bat", "monster", "horror", "horrorart", "darkart"], "extra": {}}
