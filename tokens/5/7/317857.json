Ancient monuments with inscribed rune-like symbols belong to the Paleolithic. These symbols became the proforma of future magical signs (including not only runes). Gradually, these symbols turned into sacred alphabets, and then transformed into Futhark (runic system, row). The runic system forms a system that has a powerful egregor and is associated with certain forces of the world. This system is the basis for a more or less accurate description of the world. Each sign opens the door to the world of associations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUrhrwQsMf1JfcSjVmRk4Xj7tWfGrwe4GVg3sAXaN4btL", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNTfpgrryp7HkzUrmp1WuJQQUp6rsPyj36fvNp4Tq6wie", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUrhrwQsMf1JfcSjVmRk4Xj7tWfGrwe4GVg3sAXaN4btL", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ZureAxGJUy8VJccbJ5kAaxAmMEPgzz3uj"], "tags": ["Runicart", "Futhark", "runes"], "extra": {}}
