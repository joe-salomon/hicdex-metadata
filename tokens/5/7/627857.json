Her bloodline was that of submissive celibate home keepers and so her very birth was a shock to all.\nBut her mother taught her to be valiant. And to understand that she was borne of God's love, flesh and blood.\nShe grew up incapable of fearing any female. She saw them as lowly and not of her kind.\nHer lack of father enabled her to be both child and parent to herself.\nNoble. Wise and most obviously,\nbeautiful.\nHer intimidating radiance breathtaking.\nHer elegant form always modestly wrapped for none to touch.\nUntil the day of Femi.\nOn this day she found her only weakness and she loved him beyond all explanation.
