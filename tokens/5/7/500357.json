It is not always open to the public, so I was glad that my guide Jay was able to arrange for someone to open the door for us to take a quick look inside. I was not disappointed. The old murals were stunning and very old. The light coming through the windows made it a very special experience.\n\n5616px X 3744px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRDRkrSpMbbvBkg3GJvQ52n13ze1kKSuHUJ9T8z8ADLMm", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRQQkP6UTLFLGwCNwjjGFCspUyzQuD9QGzhLTEwKJUmoe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRDRkrSpMbbvBkg3GJvQ52n13ze1kKSuHUJ9T8z8ADLMm", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VE8kpjJGBEPsrrErtrc8NKC8oKe1cQTWF"], "tags": ["photography", "documentary", "trekking", "journey", "storytelling", "nepal", "langtang", "culture", "nature"], "extra": {}}
