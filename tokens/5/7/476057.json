Built in 1921 by eccentric artists Eleanor and George Bridges, the home was a gathering place for influential artists such as Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway. When I visited the property with the current owner I was allowed to observe the energy and see if I felt the presence of spirits. This property feels like there\u2019s always an orchestra, a party that will never ever end. \nThis statue was found tossed aside on the property and placed here by the current owner. It shows what appears to be a Saint in ecstasy with a serpent rising behind him. Behind the statue are pink flowers, as the original owners planted countless perennial pink flowers and plants all over the property that still grow today.  I love this unique and strange statue, it calls out for all who see it to comment on its beauty. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmR1rGksttfJsYLThV4DRjkBUVckn7NHXbgSbDGyLxuiL2", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb3d1fSG7AxdZDr8LrAuHDVsHVKDY5mDsfMwgoZArRYHm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmR1rGksttfJsYLThV4DRjkBUVckn7NHXbgSbDGyLxuiL2", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hZ4xUe27QGrigjR7Qk1YYZ2mrWpkaHYDQ"], "tags": ["Statue", "pink", "historical", "Saint", "serpent"], "extra": {}}
