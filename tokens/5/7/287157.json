Keep 2 tokens. One to sell, and one to keep if you like my art. Return the remaining tokens to me so I can put them back on the market so other people have a chance to get them.\n\nIts very easy to identify accounts you interact with. So sending tokens or currency to other wallets doesn't really give you much anonymity.\n\nAppreciate yout time! Enjoy\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeichdadppvpu4c6hsypxwnikbeqc5ksjq6e4mbgyrnqyoh3rlrq5qy", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafybeichdadppvpu4c6hsypxwnikbeqc5ksjq6e4mbgyrnqyoh3rlrq5qy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeichdadppvpu4c6hsypxwnikbeqc5ksjq6e4mbgyrnqyoh3rlrq5qy", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1eht4WAjkqU7kaupJd8qCDmec9HuKfGf68"], "tags": ["hoarders", "objkt4objkt", "bots", "nomateriaforyou"], "extra": {}}
