However, when he saw Jaci, the Moon, reflected in the waters of the stream, he wanted to go live with her in the sky and become a star.\n\nFor days and nights on end, Nai\u00e1 stayed there, on the edge of the stream, waiting and admiring the reflection of the moon, without eating or drinking. And she ended up wasting away and dying.\n\nWith pity, the Moon turned it into a different star: a water star. And that's why the Vit\u00f3ria R\u00e9gia flowers only open at night.\n\nThe Vit\u00f3ria R\u00e9gia is an aquatic plant originally from the Amazon. Its circular leaves can be over two meters in diameter and its delicate flowers bloom in January and February, opening only at night and lasting 48 hours. <Crypto Legends | A Series by Renancio Monte | 2021>", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP429QsFbo4cG1pXCEdZ1dGtnT6Mg8T4AZnGGiVzWrqm1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXokddi5Ve98MZfFSBmY6eVs7XWjLoMM8gxxESXdNvSLt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP429QsFbo4cG1pXCEdZ1dGtnT6Mg8T4AZnGGiVzWrqm1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SkdTvjpPYuz5LNEa8NYDsxNoDzVjvocRT"], "tags": ["characters", "brazil", "legends", "cryptolegends", "forest"], "extra": {}}
