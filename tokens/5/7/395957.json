The hike through high-mountain terrain up to Trolltunga (1180 m) is long and demanding, but you are rewarded with magnificent views. \nTook me 12 hours to complete, right after this, and still in Norway, I started photographing people, until present day.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZThntWBV2d7c1pbB7XHb2ZzoWUUNPW1esokty93uRnuq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNxh4pv2TucY7RKfmydTDM7x2gXvjuf8CZ3F5VzYaNPiJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZThntWBV2d7c1pbB7XHb2ZzoWUUNPW1esokty93uRnuq", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1KhAGXM5GxQX2au4ox8qgC1B3w8W4tvnge"], "tags": ["nft", "landscape", "norway", "mellback"], "extra": {}}
