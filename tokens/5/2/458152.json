I saw the clouds, I saw the freedom it has, and I envied the clouds. I don't know how long I spent looking at them, maybe, minutes.. maybe, hours.. it didn't really matter to me at that point.. \n\nI got totally distracted by the clouds.. then I felt it..

I am complete..\n\nA visual motion I made through the study of Perlin Noise and Flow Field.\n\n//Made with processing using java library.\n\n//1200*800px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYPYMvW6tUSewTLoKiR5Fgw17sW4h8bcFaFiBH3bHUjQ5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdDpAi7eDAazgs13WkWok8vBajnzUQGc8h1CWQHcj7V2j", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYPYMvW6tUSewTLoKiR5Fgw17sW4h8bcFaFiBH3bHUjQ5", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1ZjSe3hSwrvwhywZg3QgQAnnGtHpnJsWDy"], "tags": ["flowfield", "contemporary", "generativeart", "modern", "motion", "perlinnoise", "digital", "creativecoding", "visual", "processing", "p5js", "codingart", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
