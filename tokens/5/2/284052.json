All the pictures show women in the best versions of themselves. The woman, like the red color for me, conveys sexuality, beauty and power. And the crimson color goes hand in hand with the woman. Every job has its meaning, but I suggest you find something in common in each peace.\n\nSelf love is a state of appreciation for oneself that grows from actions that support our physical, psychological and spiritual growth. And this lady shows this appreciation to her self. I want to dedicate this job to all women who lack self-confidence. Let\u2019s love ourselves! We\u2019re the best.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeidgsv5v76omcfmmgwsi7jcvdqelnqnch5ahvjpazg5vwlgwywfj54", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreia6a7hucoqx6kax232sth5fng3jjraozkrirq6hziljc4i5oxfuty", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeidgsv5v76omcfmmgwsi7jcvdqelnqnch5ahvjpazg5vwlgwywfj54", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Lx898mc9n8QBsFc8UqdMjX4JDrK2foDzn"], "tags": ["redunion", "self-love", "woman"], "extra": {}}
