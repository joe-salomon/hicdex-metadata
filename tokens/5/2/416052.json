It is unknown whether they ever wed or had children, despite the sincere efforts of the magically inclined craftsman who was the girl's uncle.\n\nThis single doll is all that remains of his efforts, and is therefore imbued with all of the fertile and fecund power of the set concentrated into a single artifact.\n\nThis digital \"token\" confers upon you\na portion of the pro-creative romantic \nand para-natural power of this \nradiant meta-object.\n\nThink on the maker of this physical item\nand send them your gratitude\nthrough the centuries - for the\nprivilege of holding it's\nmeta-verse avatar.\n\nI took this photo and was blessed\nby this object and the sincere\nexpression of it's maker.\n\nI truly hope my photo gives a portion\nof that warmth and comfort to you.\n\nHPL\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeTRW8mgXyLZnEVWsVNeko8RUiaaPZRf8zBvzqHbrSjiE", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdSrajvycSLPbi6FTXGWzHmdeBSBUxQndWQUaCPypdzf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmeTRW8mgXyLZnEVWsVNeko8RUiaaPZRf8zBvzqHbrSjiE", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Nh672Ln1KRwVgXVdS6NR3NcSWjUSPaFuB"], "tags": ["dolls", "russian", "nesting", "matroyshka", "blue", "folkart", "magicitem"], "extra": {}}
