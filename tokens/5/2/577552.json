The statue symbolizes the freedom of independence (for that day). Lately, freedom is like being snatched away by force, we no longer have privacy, we can no longer speak out for freedom. We are like frogs in a cage. Therefore, the eyes in my artwork represent us who can only see, and can only scream but not be perceived. Like the frog. My work is a visualization of all that, Thank you", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP2U7S26YwTNuZvfsB8jVzNHFqDnyk3b2n4SQBk7QK4rF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmauTDdBJwFEfghAxowoDT3m4weafgMR5L4Grfdq1Ss2xb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP2U7S26YwTNuZvfsB8jVzNHFqDnyk3b2n4SQBk7QK4rF", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1guxH4qmkPih4L9zvqSFJdoqth21qcisaU"], "tags": ["Liberty", "Statue", "2d", "freedom", "journalist", "basquiat", "color", "colorful", "popart", "USA", "France", "America", "puffycurly", "NFT", "eye"], "extra": {}}
