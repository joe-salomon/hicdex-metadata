Not all cats are lucky enough to be the companion animal of a poet. Much less a poet as important as Cirilo Sansebiera(*).\n\nCreator of the \"Effervescent Sentimentalism\" movement, Cirilo dedicated a large part of his poetry to Elmer, thus making him the most famous cat in the Republic (the people of Morondanga love poetry). He called Elmer his \"receptacle of poems\" as he was his only companion, and witness to the verses that Cirilo created aloud.\n\nUnder Elmer's statue are his ashes. People leave him the typical blue ribbons of the carnival(**) as an offering and as a symbol of joy and celebration.\n\nIt is known that Cirilo Sansebiera disappeared without a trace in the 1970s. Some say that this was his last great poetic act. It is said that in Cirilo's house only Elmer was left with a note that read: \"Here is a poem that breathes. Please take care of it\".\n\nFlora M\u00e1rquez - 2021\n\n(*) See OBJKT #240242\n(**) See OBJKT #220679\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYHmtmcF9nUtHegaHvpkuSC3GDFQ2yHyezHs95KMWZXPa", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qma1HPnbduWcBj77NU1mWeQqy76ywERQFTPQ9n6GRdXBNf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYHmtmcF9nUtHegaHvpkuSC3GDFQ2yHyezHs95KMWZXPa", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1TbLqpBNkwxFxpFbfnhUdaL2nsBexxpjPb"], "tags": ["Morondanga", "Stamp", "Cat"], "extra": {}}
