{"__version": 1, "token_id": 551652, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Meta Heart", "description": "Envisioned, designed, and rendered in the heart of Lisbon, Meta Heart is a collaborative piece between Mirros and Modern Mantra that represents our desire to cultivate and grow the new frontier of emerging nomadic technologists here in the heart of Portugal. No matter what your story, your history, your race, or your creed, we welcome all aspiring people to our home to help us build and cultivate the Fifth Empire. \n\nWe chose to mint 1974 editions in homage to the Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o dos Cravos (Carnation Revolution). An event that led to the freeing of the Portuguese from dictator rule, and the beginning of a new age of democracy, the end of the Portuguese colonial war, and numerous societal and social innovations.\n\nThese NFTs stand for a similar societal shift. A shift away from the ways of the old world into the metaverse. Unlike the events which inspired this drop, our revolution won't be broadcast on television. Our wars won't be fought with weapons. Rather, our revolution will be through the intersection of code and loving intention for Lisbon to be home to another new technological frontier.  \n\nWe open our hearts to anybody who feels called to this city. All walks of life, and all people, know you have a home in Lisboa.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdMz8B2g2g7HywhY8xdy5GSTSH5gf9hhcwuWHdjioMFe1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQakASHgMEUBu5fAFUiqa4LhfTkcBQa5BPsLRnaJaXtDK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdMz8B2g2g7HywhY8xdy5GSTSH5gf9hhcwuWHdjioMFe1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1Qhc6P2aK623iNKaufvnwx8KSYTghYG642"], "tags": ["digital", "sacredgeometry", "heart", "metatron'scube"], "extra": {}}
