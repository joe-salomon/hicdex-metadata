The reproduction is a beautiful object of the early twentieth century and is therefore in fact an antiquarian find in itself. A find that represents an older find, which in turn represents the timeless icon of classic femininity. Hence the idea of \u200b\u200btransforming this beautiful Venus head into a conceptual Chinese box, unfolding many different possibilities, thanks to CGI.\nThe head was scanned with a photogrammetry device, then processed in a 3D environment and remapped with new imaginative, and colorful textures, all deriving from my original freehand drawings or digital collage artworks. The new heads were then inserted into an abstract set of metaphysical lights and backgrounds. The old forgotten plaster becomes a mutant virtual being, which recycles itself in infinite contemporary contexts.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNMMct1iGqVgZgD7LyV4K51iw1zzy3dE9tNnfoWSRPV5o", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWszZD5ysi29jmnBDrdWUn6mnyjvnPP4ym76SUuNNDdgf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNMMct1iGqVgZgD7LyV4K51iw1zzy3dE9tNnfoWSRPV5o", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1amsgMaX2kYNLHMttB26Rf1EXmy5eJAwZG"], "tags": ["3d", "3dart", "3dscan", "3dmapping", "virtualsculpture", "virtualinstallation", "interactive", "ARart", "AugmentedReality", "VirtualReality", "Venus", "Model", "Modeling.Face", "Woman", "Money"], "extra": {}}
