RED and BLUE Inserts would serve as Voting Inserts, determining community decisions.   The first two were Molotov Jones (RED) and Frankie Carbone (BLUE) and the were quickly put into action to determine the fate of the Godzilla 1/1.\n\nSince their debut, Molotov Jones and Carbone have been a part of multiple Vault Voting 3v3nts to determine if cards in the thr33som3s Vault should be burnt or redistributed to the community.\n\nThe 12 Days of thr33smas is a chase 3v3nt. Collect all 12, #3MAS1 through #3MAS12, in the announced timeframe to receive #3MAS13 via airdrop.\n\nThis card is an INSERT. It has all established Standard Insert Utility and may compound additional Utilities over time.
