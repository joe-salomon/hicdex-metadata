I was at a beach somewhere, and there was this woman standing near me. I couldn't see her face because the wind was so strong, and there were so many seagulls. I tried to take a photo of her, and this is what it looks like. Her face was perfectly hidden behind a seagull, and there were also oranges, which I don't know where it came from, floating in mid-air. Although I never got to see her face, it felt like she was someone I knew. I woke up, but the photo I saw was so clear and vivid that I couldn't get it out of my head. I was so moved by it that I felt I had to draw it no matter what. So I decided to grab my iPad and draw this picture with my finger.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUwrhgqrnydtTz1V62cK6RreLu24TLwoXqTaYsiyDY7KP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYEJcXbm6vrwvwrrDcwe2Rw82QGrm6K56JxT69AMve1P1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUwrhgqrnydtTz1V62cK6RreLu24TLwoXqTaYsiyDY7KP", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1W39qSZea6ci7hJQasEzHSpjaqxoLAXQCi"], "tags": ["illustration", "digital", "dream", "beach", "seagulls"], "extra": {}}
