Vilizquiz wanted to paint me but I noticed he was tired, so I took the cover off my head to show him that I had already decided on my own color palette.\n(Shhh: When you let go of mechanical thoughts, sometimes ideas blossom on their own.)\nI told him: I can paint myself, you go take a nap, lazybones!\nIf you collect me I'll wake him up and we'll go to a party, we'll get drunk on whiskey and dance listening to the latest Mozart production.\nYes, we'll be drunk dancing to a Requiem. That's how you live when you're a bunny.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmc8GtYPub1tZrtqnKyKEFE4n1v2xN5tmZu5a28vAFo2WF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUEmNFDUQoBRpVqrPy56SiEm7FUD2FRkA6R2bTJwUyaq1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmc8GtYPub1tZrtqnKyKEFE4n1v2xN5tmZu5a28vAFo2WF", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1LkZeTk6UoisEM1VvE7qWewjcE25hP9qNk"], "tags": ["schizoidbunny", "bunny", "nftart", "nftcollectors", "nftartist", "art", "nftcommunity", "goodluck"], "extra": {}}
