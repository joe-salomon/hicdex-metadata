To become the person we dreamed to be or had the strength to pursue what we wanted or even to survive day by day. And along the way, we went through various experiences. So much that when we've finally grown up, we become who we are.\n\nBut during that long journey to become who we are today, we have lost some people, lost some stories and gave up something in order to live the life.\n\nIn the real world, it is neither beautiful nor gentle. Some people have given up on their brightness, purity, innocence, memories, wishes, dreams, and some may have to give up their smiles in order to grow up and live.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qma4USvUTvQNAEuemoVFmJFuPNJgpYKtMFShqUsEH2AUe4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTC98hjnsxzVvyBLv7AD4cZXRaPkgcuz6zSZ57Bx4KeJ3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qma4USvUTvQNAEuemoVFmJFuPNJgpYKtMFShqUsEH2AUe4", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L4D1pNmrUeyWCPGX8QGcWh4q6az3r62bi"], "tags": ["illustration", "b/w", "b/wofgirls", "girl.woman.growup", "feeling", "thought", "nature", "human"], "extra": {}}
