{"__version": 1, "token_id": 554152, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Luna", "description": "In ancient Roman religion and myth, Luna is the divine embodiment of the Moon.  She is often presented as the female complement of the Sun, Sol, conceived of as a god.  Luna is also sometimes represented as an aspect of the Roman triple goddess (diva triformis), along with Proserpina and Hecate.  Luna is not always a distinct goddess, but sometimes rather an epithet that specializes a goddess, since both Diana and Juno are identified as moon goddesses. \nLuna's Greek counterpart was Selene.  In Roman art and literature, myths of Selene are adapted under the name of Luna.  The myth of Endymion, for instance, was a popular subject for Roman wall painting.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTxnstcYLWCeF29nXVfw1WTLMxTTt8HbzkiRvx2eezrF1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW4Bq6FUguNKpU3B6t5KNqk7EwyxF662pBNqBTQHMNj5q", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTxnstcYLWCeF29nXVfw1WTLMxTTt8HbzkiRvx2eezrF1", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2MQb1JwJCF3gBQgGNdzcE32aXcxkD7HxzK"], "tags": ["Luna", "alterage", "hen", "xtz", "nft", "nftartist", "dark", "darknft", "myth", "goddesses", "pointilism", "darkness", ""], "extra": {}}
