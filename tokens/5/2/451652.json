For me, insecurity is someone's regret that causes someone to not want to do something so they are afraid to interact socially. The title of this work uses the term moody which is translated into English which means Hypochondriac. I visualized the object of the hand covering his whole body with the meaning that someone who is insecure will close himself tightly. The use of red objects in the eyes is a symbol that an insecure person will experience overthinking which results in negative thoughts. This work uses 3D digital media, through this medium it can represent me expressing a dark atmosphere.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUQBJEcF4bw534zPWgMx7BpL6C1bqFvs4czFmeBRvrPnZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeMaxGeNXxkgdh1Gy2pZnxSPGJAo8eUhoo4Nt2BtN5tgh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUQBJEcF4bw534zPWgMx7BpL6C1bqFvs4czFmeBRvrPnZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bkijFBq4h4dmVa9TBANpaAABXti7zPY2v"], "tags": ["Sad", "Dark", "3D", "Anxiety", "Figure", ""], "extra": {}}
