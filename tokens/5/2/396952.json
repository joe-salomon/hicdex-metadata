(1/3)", "description": "Excerpt #1/3 from the music video \"December's Deep Wish\", by Twin Render --- a collaborative project between Sky Goodman (visual/poetry) and Joey Meland (audio)\n\n\"\nThe way passing cars and buildings \nmake a world, a future place. The way I learn to accept\nwhat the fuck is just a material thing in front of my face. \n\nAnd what a struggle it has been all these years\nto be in this body and to accept the body. \nBody not just as my body but body as car, \nbody as building, body as face\nanything tangible.\n\n\nWhen I see the glass windows of buildings on my way home,\nI see prophecy. \n\nOracle. \n\nMy own projections playing out \nan entire narrative onto the scene. \n\nTo stop the thoughts feels like \ndeath.\n\n\t\tSo why bother? \n\nThe mind police haven\u2019t caught me yet.\n\"\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSMrJ4RNn3eAD2pcVeNdSabTRUzYbQAsP8GVx9ApWztDf", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPNMcx3bcMxhnU6vKrg86mWUcX4WTnpo7iTv4HGrVRum6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSMrJ4RNn3eAD2pcVeNdSabTRUzYbQAsP8GVx9ApWztDf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1UHeVXQc2oWkmUUC6BFZS2ciHzDTWNNdaB"], "tags": ["audiovisual", "collaboration", "musicvideo", "glitchaesthetic", "electronic", "dance", "techno", "idm", "chicago", "twinrender", "videohardware", "videofeedback", "analogglitch", "atmospheric"], "extra": {}}
