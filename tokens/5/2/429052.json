Her headgear? Dark hues... blues, purples, some reds. Her bold, bulbous headgear doesn't frame her face insomuch as it engulfs and centers it. Her look stabs your eyeballs & demands that you become her willing hostage, unable to turn your eyes away.\n\nYou do not know her story, but you will pay any amount of ransom to have that privilege. Those bright eyes, those lips. Looking closer you might even say that she resembles a lollipop, or perhaps a very colorful Neopolitan ice cream cone. You must decide, and it is in that deliberation that you will unravel her true mysteries.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSRUcJFPZPDFqyWMCcBxiMZmvUb3du3U4KkDuPRE7Tqcz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUsg5pbksgwUqRggZ8dBpDchtnLpTi9K3nSSiEpQxBHCZ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSRUcJFPZPDFqyWMCcBxiMZmvUb3du3U4KkDuPRE7Tqcz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1X1ToMENirSHmj89avqhfxhRZpqiiXNohX"], "tags": ["woman", "headgear", "hat", "style", "fashion", "mystery", "icecream", "lollipop", "1940s", "1950s", "Hollywood", "glamour"], "extra": {}}
