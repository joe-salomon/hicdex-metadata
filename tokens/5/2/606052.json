Today I was able to think about something more or less again. I saw the sun on the balcony, opened the door, the frosty air burned my nostrils and skin, I photographed the corner covered with snow. Later I remembered that my diary began with self-isolation and covid disease. Well? maybe this is a Polaroid diary of my self-isolation. In Russia, the bad news, the government is seeking to ban everything that interferes with being a totalitarian state. I finished reading a book about Yegor Letov from the Grazhdanskaya Oborona group. And I feel myself being pinned into a corner. It's scary to even write your thoughts on social networks. Because even for posts in social networks in Russia, people can be arrested. It all lasted a long time, but when my body is weakened from illness, I am especially vulnerable to these thoughts. I am sorry that everything is happening this way and that I cannot influence the situation in my native country in any way.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYSTgP6XcDN5vLHFwoyegoEYa45NBzAGVDGzjgWXtbfdV", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUZ5at1LTGdSaJqEaEmSseTGHgmdRZQwqoE1KrqKaFrBU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYSTgP6XcDN5vLHFwoyegoEYa45NBzAGVDGzjgWXtbfdV", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1d5HE9dWCn6ciiSgLRvfegDiHyMUt6oo4w"], "tags": ["polaroiddiary"], "extra": {}}
