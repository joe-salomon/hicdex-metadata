Then I waited until the year 2010 to enter the time tunnel and traveled to 2020 to deliver the file to my current self. But... DAMN (Demi Allah Mau Nangis), the file was already corrupted. I should've taken the version from the year of 2002. It was the first time I used the moniker 'Adhit Android'. \n\n\"Resistance will suffer the same destruction.\"\n\nI never had a chance to finish this track because the original session file was corrupted and gone along with my malfunctioning device. But, here it is, reconstructed and rebuilt around its leftovers. A piece of my life, the very first song I produced under the name 'Adhit Android', 2021 version.\n\nADRENAL REVOLUTION\nSong and artwork by Adhit Android\n\n\"There is no peace in the world until the power of dictators is destroyed\"", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW5bFxh8bkKnWehev3tNdGgTYquEVvfYc6qaKKpbnVaiT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfWjZTbN7BZZo1swtsJ94SkirSxW8St7soyg5PGvLjFUi", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW5bFxh8bkKnWehev3tNdGgTYquEVvfYc6qaKKpbnVaiT", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2KEGPM4ik3tEfBFBCAg1hSW7cZpZsFsnDJ"], "tags": ["industrial", "electronica", "electronic", "hicetnuncaudio", "henaudio", "henmusic", "beats", "indonesia", "mp3", "objkt", "synth", "synthesizer", "indonesiaaudio", "song", "music", "henradio", "kolektifkolektoranabel", "audio", "nftart", "nftcollector", "nftaudio", "NFTmusic", "NFTune", "NFTcollection", "nftcollectors", "NFTCommunity", "nftindonesia", "NFTrilisanterbaru", ""], "extra": {}}
