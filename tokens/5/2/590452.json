Radical change comes from radical empathy.\n\nI\u2019m known for digitally altering landscapes: transforming them, presenting another time and place. With AR digital sculpture, I\u2019d like to alter yours.  This small series presents talismans for the future. \n\nTalisman (II) will rotate for normal displays. It is also interactive, allowing users to zoom in and out, and tilt the view.\n\n\nShort biography:\nTaking cues from 19th-century landscape painting, 20th-century cinema, and 21st-century planetary research, Kelly Richardson crafts digital works which offer imaginative glimpses of the future that prompt a careful consideration of the present.\n \nRichardson\u2019s work has been featured in the Beijing, Busan, Canadian, Gwangju and Montr\u00e9al biennales, as well as major moving image exhibitions internationally, including TIFF and Sundance Film Festival. Her works are represented in the collections of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (USA), SMoCA (USA), Albright-Knox Art Gallery (USA), National Gallery of Canada, Art Gallery of Ontario, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al, Arts Council Collection (England), Southampton City Art Gallery (England), Towner (England), Arts Council Collection (England), among others.
