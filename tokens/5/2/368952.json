In their culture, Mogonal\u00f3 is a huge serpent related to the powers of the underworld.\n\nWhen the climate is mild it lives under the water or in the large ant hills, when changing places it emanates a colored vapor that originates the rainbow.\n\nThe rainbow serpent is also part of Australian, Inca and Mesoamerican mythology. That's why I decided to represent it in the ouroboric position (eating it's own tail) since this symbol is also universal and can be found in Nordic, South American, Middle Eastern and Indian cultures.\n\n\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude16\u0308\ud835\ude19 (@\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude2b\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXQ9bz2EGKV17PbrvjZprRAA1eTsym53MgQf4U5dyYaFd", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTt35LsLYbHjoGcrh5wjfZK8Hc9ykaJKS7cT3dRKse7jS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXQ9bz2EGKV17PbrvjZprRAA1eTsym53MgQf4U5dyYaFd", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology"], "extra": {}}
