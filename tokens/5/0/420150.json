Probably existed in an alternate reality where apes ruled over the earth.\n\nImmortals were highly trained soldiers with great numbers, if any soldier was slain during battle, another one would be ready to take that soldier's place, hence they were named immortals.\n\nThis is the short range weapon of the immortals used on both land & horseback. handle is leather wrapped. The sharp part can go through any armor. The hilt balances the weight. 4 gems are implemented on the weapon named \"Firooze\" , notice how they shine!\n\nThe word sagaris is carved out in \"Mikhi\" on the blade. Other carvings are inspired by mathematical art used in old architecture of said kingdom. these black smiths are also artists! can you guess what shapes are these carvings created from?\n\n2K rendered 60FPS ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYhHTbTcFhJQ98UTcvMawThgPQjSw8erJq8FXMDrA7ko4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWGN6ghopeGSdNR9RuoFtBcj4DwyLZ3nkCMeQxzwHZcby", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYhHTbTcFhJQ98UTcvMawThgPQjSw8erJq8FXMDrA7ko4", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1MdXDde4Lrzb5RyEfVP3kDNsfqtRnEeMn9"], "tags": ["axe", "history", "animation", "3d", "3dart", "weapon"], "extra": {}}
