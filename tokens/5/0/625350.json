{"__version": 1, "token_id": 625350, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "The TechNude I", "description": "TechNude is a 7 piece collection and it's my first collection. \n\nThis one is TechNude I, the first one of seven. There is nothing here because it looks cool or colorful. Every element has a purpose in it, even unbalanced empty spaces. They have been created for something you have to think of.\n\nAbout the collection:\n\nThere are three main phrases which summarize the collection in a nutshell:\n\nNudity is the invisible cloth itself.\n\nThe Internet gave the power of becoming digital gods to every individual, just like nude Graeco-Roman god statues.\n\nArt itself was a prison for nudity before the Internet.\n\nThe collection will include 3 females, 3 males and 1 both. All artworks are already finished and I am working on my third collection now.\n\nDue to restrictions, the writing of the collection and other things are on linktr.ee/LDVinci.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nI will mint 6 pieces of the collection, 7 editions per piece week by week. One week after minting the 6th one, the remaining ones will be burnt. \n\nThe 7th and the last one will be minted in 7 editions but I will send it to the collectors who have all 6 pieces. Of course it will be a present and free. \n\nContact info: dedevincileonar@gmail.com\n\nOriginal file will be sent to the buyers, 4096x3072, 35,97 mb.\n\nSee you in another art!\n\n\n\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWopUBsXi6apypduD1q2F1fdw9yCh6q9Z3rm9cU5FpaMq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeqzSZicYj1nSqCp9yVSXfqyCnBCh34KPCLeX2dDNfh5P", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWopUBsXi6apypduD1q2F1fdw9yCh6q9Z3rm9cU5FpaMq", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1QXZ5XKDabw18NE6GaNf7BJd32ne1gUJEG"], "tags": ["Technude", "nudity", "technology", "art", "digitalart", "digitalpainting", "minicollection", ""], "extra": {}}
