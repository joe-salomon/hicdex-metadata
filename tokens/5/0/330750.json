As the Commander-In-Chief, (and I use that term very loosely) he did everything in his power to roll back so much of the socio-economic progress in America that the name Salamander-In-Chief seems more befitting of this befuddling baboon. I might sound harsh and quite frankly crude, but I'm done dealing with anti-science, anti-logic, anti-human policies that destroy lives and the Earth. I truly hope that in 50, 100, 1000 years from now if there still are even people existing to the read this and understand just how insane the last 5 or so years have been. Trump is one of those polarizing figures that illustrates just how delicate the concept of democracy really is and how it can crumb before your eyes. One thing is for sure, he will be mostly forgotten as times change and life moves on, but he will remembered as the absolute worst political figure in the last 100 years, maybe of all time. Though that's for future generations to judge, not me.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWNaPDVnDtRTeyPhLLwA3iK7X66Czmssxa3N8Yr53nqAZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVSCretjw3jraxfU2qqfEFXudAnAdK8rmu4iRjeKjiszm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWNaPDVnDtRTeyPhLLwA3iK7X66Czmssxa3N8Yr53nqAZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
