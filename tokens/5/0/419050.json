So cute that you can see tourists in streets taking pictures, tasting the traditional local wine of the village. People tastes dozens of different flavored wines, indecisive ones gets tipsy with all that and thats when the bread smell gets you and walk you through the streets until you see her friendly smile. If you decide to tell her that she is pretty like I did, she\u2019d say \u201cIm too old to be pretty i was pretty 20 years ago not now\u201d And then she will look down. \n\nApril 2017 From one of our travel to \u015eirince. \n\nIm trying to remind myself how magical the travelling , how inspiring it is.
