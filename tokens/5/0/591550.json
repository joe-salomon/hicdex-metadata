Of the many epic photographs we shot, this one, a feature of her intense eyes, brought out a digital creation that is a good callback to the popular film: \u2018The Matrix.\u2019 My finished piece was definitely inspired. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSVrpztQKksjd12Pm4vabpZsmdTfjDV15eWiiRpv2z6Nc", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeoxKjHafPi5CbtTNaUZmvcMp3D42KzPuBgMM9MJBh1Ax", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSVrpztQKksjd12Pm4vabpZsmdTfjDV15eWiiRpv2z6Nc", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dSpqLuThjQLVH8ffuEDNRRQmyub6cq5F1"], "tags": ["sakura", "anime", "pink", "digital", "art", "photography", "photograph"], "extra": {}}
