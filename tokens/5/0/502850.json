I wrote this in response. \"I am a \u201csnowflake\u201d, you say. Yes. Yes I am. What you see as beta weakness is actually the truth about yourself revealing itself to the world. You may have more physical prowess or intellectual bonafides, but one thing to remember; we are all snowflakes from inside the heavens proceeding to descend and undulate with the coming and goings of the wind of time. We wander in a collective soupy storm praying to land on frozen ground and not the instant death of warmth. Most of us land, some gracefully, some not so much; we all land on each other, creating layers and layers; generations of frozen souls lost to history, deep under our future generations\u2019 feet. Some are swept away by the ravages of ego and denial. Each of us trying to keep from dying; to stay alive for one moment longer in the air; one more moment. You and I are the same, we may be different snowflakes, but we are part of the same frozen fabric of reality. Why fight? Let\u2019s enjoy the ride.\" ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf9znbgAR7szgZj9bv8GkAoxb9reJLjvSpKvbcZkEF8Vs", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmStBHjxuEFkUxipuVLhZptzKwZ5uGqhTih4re5uM2z4qD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf9znbgAR7szgZj9bv8GkAoxb9reJLjvSpKvbcZkEF8Vs", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
