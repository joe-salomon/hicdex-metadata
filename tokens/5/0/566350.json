{"__version": 1, "token_id": 566350, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "plant", "description": "Humans and nature synergize each other because humans use energy from the sun and plants to produce organic compounds through photosynthesis. Humans, in turn, convert these organic compounds into energy within their cells to power bodily functions such as breathing, electrical signals in the brain, and more, allowing them to perform work on a larger scale that aids in ecosystem restoration or environmental mitigation. If humans reconnected with nature it could reduce the likelihood of humans dominating nature. If humans didn\u2019t reconnect with nature, then they would dominate nature like they do now. Humans could reconnect with nature by forming relationships with plants to harness nature's regenerative power to heal the Earth. Without nature there wouldn't be us.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmcu7fSNTUzbGAfX5hvXabprdNGYUgHK52UnkYZLnHqRaw", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRqwZ4sJvubwjBTuDdJp4C5CE9A1Bns9Ugwtg6oHirz7v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmcu7fSNTUzbGAfX5hvXabprdNGYUgHK52UnkYZLnHqRaw", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1gzdhojRETKeQv35SxSoBjh36EGrkLBvEX"], "tags": ["photography", "nature", "future", "plant", "regenerative", "symbiosis", "flower", ""], "extra": {}}
