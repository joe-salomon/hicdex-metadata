The social distanced houses depict the loss of physical human interaction and communication within the practice environment experienced during the  pandemic. Individual accessible gardens, an essential outdoor getaway to those in quarantine,  remind us designers of the importance of protecting nature and fostering sustainable design  approaches. \n\nEach distinct design and colour of the architecture celebrates the diversity of culture, tradition, and creativity that each aspiring architect represents. There is a central gathering platform that connects the houses. It symbolises community and inclusivity: the power of sharing ideas and digital collaboration across borders made possible through technology in this digitally driven era.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmakbv17SZQYBwKYt2QmQzmPRbyTfupsp5PJwX25TLVfaa", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWcbSGGKvJEGqsd3sLYw8jugStAbdGisejusT71ufWLJW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmakbv17SZQYBwKYt2QmQzmPRbyTfupsp5PJwX25TLVfaa", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bhECEHTNQfrRYFcSC9xSFeobjDrrNQcZd"], "tags": ["arcasia", "acya", "archiNFT", "Architecture", "Architects"], "extra": {}}
