Standing on the summit of Wo\u0142owiec, I was breathless at the sight of the morning spectacle, in which mists, clouds, first rays of the sun, temperature difference and beautiful High Tatras played a role. It was then that the trail I was going to follow that September day began to appear. That day turned out to be an amazing adventure. I walked from Polana Chocho\u0142owska to the peak of Wo\u0142owiec, from where I watched the sunrise. Then I walked along the chain of Western Tatra Mountains, up to Bystr\u00e1, which is on the Slovakian side, to return to Polana Chocho\u0142owska at the end. I walked about 30km that day and covered about 2500m up and the same amount down. It was a huge, yet incredibly rewarding effort. That day once again confirmed my conviction that trekking in the Tatra Mountains, although demanding, the pleasure of it makes up for all fatigue and difficulties.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXAJ7wcmFZv66MbV6vGWLDTMrRdQaUd2kWE67rPa1AQ5v", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdiA7LWpqUPcij8CERR4i9jKn1sbJ7YXcWghHaRUgTcP3", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXAJ7wcmFZv66MbV6vGWLDTMrRdQaUd2kWE67rPa1AQ5v", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1QGnFHUB1NX7mBvBDg85CMUrpXPWKLg4aW"], "tags": ["photography", "photo", "colors", "saturation", "light", "beauty", "camera", "grass", "sun", "mountains", "tatras", "sky", "sunrise", "fogs"], "extra": {}}
