I have painted my vision of a moment before the collision of the two equal forces.There is a barely visible VENOM word painted into the fire that is between the two enemy heads. The original is a black and white painting I have painted with oil on a wooden board.\n\nI made this artwork for the Talenthouse contest for the upcoming film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage. I have missed the delivery date so I made it a cryptoart 1/100.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP3AHZ6hQq4u9Y3rUsev49J1QVZ7j2dcBa4spXYAE1nUZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbM6UPrd7wbFd9cQXXzjg9HSSRB8EaCLwjJdbFbLykMr6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP3AHZ6hQq4u9Y3rUsev49J1QVZ7j2dcBa4spXYAE1nUZ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1L1rdDzjGNx5B6SSfRGiWvTmi94FH4XVSP"], "tags": ["venom", "surrealart", "abstractart", "darkart", "venom2", "carnage", "oilpainting"], "extra": {}}
