{"__version": 1, "token_id": 619050, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Una historia de domingo", "description": "Sunday has a marked sense of family in Cuban culture. This poem is a reflection of the anxiety and anguish that some people experience on Sundays away from their family or a love for the circumstances of life. It is an exhausting struggle not to fall into depression when everything around you conspires to make you feel sadder. Ultimately it is a hope that that feeling will not last long because it is only one more day of the week that will pass.\nThe music that accompanies the poem is specially composed for this text.\n\nText: Greisi Gonz\u00e1lez\nMusic: Ernesto Cisneros", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXqsZy9dZ7U1r2eFZf3hVpFXcYpyPfoHDh2qLAgodxGAb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP6uzTixfDsyWGarYrZQeSV7MKDqr4BF4cQzgX664d9bm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXqsZy9dZ7U1r2eFZf3hVpFXcYpyPfoHDh2qLAgodxGAb", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["KT1EDxYrB49HsDaHQ2pmgFihAWnCoDxRpN7B"], "tags": ["poetry", "music", "cubans", "art"], "extra": {}}
