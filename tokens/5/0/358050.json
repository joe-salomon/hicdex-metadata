{"__version": 1, "token_id": 358050, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Becky - Nothing Sounds Appealing", "description": "I met Becky at a Halloween party for the SFX industry in LA. I had a bunny costume sized for a ten year old I got from the thrift store and a cheap pair of bunny ears from Walmart on when we met. I was also ahhhhhmazingly drunk. Why she ever gave me her contact info I'll never know. We talked about shooting once or twice but it never happened and then one day she called me because she had a face painting gig for a kids birthday party the next day and needed someone to practice on. So the deal was she could come over and paint my face and then we'd shoot some photos. We ended up running all over my neighborhood shooting photos while I had a giant butterfly painted over my whole face. The things we do for our art :P\n\nThis is my 10th NFT. I've decided my initial offering this first two days in the NFT space will be 10 pieces that show the general feel of my work. After that I'm going to think on it a bit and probably limit my minting to a small weekly drop. As this is literally only my second day in the space, that is subject to change of course but I thought I would give at least somewhat of a roadmap of my plans. \n\nThank you to everyone who has shown me love so far. I really appreciate it and I can't wait to see where this goes.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNXMr63GD1H9PiNmnX3yQd5MZ9MKsoB2pyz55r14eR7vX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXaXKwJwi4u6j1hpUUG5jA29ytQyFoZGwxQ5d2bBJtZ2c", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNXMr63GD1H9PiNmnX3yQd5MZ9MKsoB2pyz55r14eR7vX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["model", "tattoo", "inked", "keithallenphillips", "neck", "graceful", "pale", "paleskin", "bnw", "nft", "bw", "blackandwhite", "photo", "photography", "photographer", "collectable", "collection", "nftart"], "extra": {}}
