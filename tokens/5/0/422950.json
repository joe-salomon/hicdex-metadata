These works explore the idea that we all are resonating connected strings. That everything is. A tribute to generative as a concept. Strings with different resonating modes generate space and time, and everything therein. These are just lines rotating at different angular velocities.\n\nA generative artwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr\u00edguez, @msoriaro.\n\nMade with Processing, 900x900px, 15s, 30fps looping mp4.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRBSfD5aRqBxfaCTSG8oe6hWvjWWEt4csDspoV16YCcfz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmemWJQFK6fdBVXQVmRNMb5jW5nd5d2B1TJHsH6vXoy4XQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRBSfD5aRqBxfaCTSG8oe6hWvjWWEt4csDspoV16YCcfz", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1eCX4smQ3LbxwDR3pqNoLQvNNKiHJtpwYz"], "tags": ["generative", "generativeart", "genart", "polylines", "geometricart", "lineart", "geometric", "loop", "video", "iillucid"], "extra": {}}
