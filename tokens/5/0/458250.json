This program allows users to enter keywords and it can use the result of images from Google's engine into a video in real-time. According to the keyword, the program will automatically adjust the position of images, positioning all of them in the center of the screen. In this version, I use \"horizon\" and \"sea\" as keywords.\n     The images searched are the experiences and imagination of people from all walks of life that were uploaded to Google. The results of keywords are the common experience and imagination of all people in the world. This performance is a collection of common experience from people. But the video also presents a kind of strange sense.\n     This artwork discusses artificial intelligence, collective consciousness, and body perception.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNg6jvKDWeSvFXNrefTovwEMXk3HbMDheaXkvuWLKirTB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV3NLB9viusyHMCt3dZsNZdQvhQgm9KS3JFBoEAbc5WT6", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNg6jvKDWeSvFXNrefTovwEMXk3HbMDheaXkvuWLKirTB", "mimeType": "video/quicktime"}], "creators": ["tz1Z3defezrcTcnd1pd6LxWyHQpc5iHZ5syf"], "tags": ["processing", "landscape", "lienchengwang", "p2tf", "generativeart", "sea", "creativecoding", "horizon", "generative", "p5js"], "extra": {}}
