Inspired by the colours and textures found in sunsets. The excitement and anticipation of the next lightning strike with its thunderous heart pounding report. Majestic waterfalls to sublime mountain skylines with their reflections in the still lakes found beneath them. From the eerie allurement of the Northern Lights to the cosmic artistry seen throughout the universe.\nUV Bodyscapes combines the beauty of the human\u00a0form with the splendor of God\u2019s creations found in this world and worlds beyond. Using temporary fluorescent materials the scenes are painted directly on the skin and photographed under black light to create a piece of art that is as unique as you are.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSDYNcZH5a7vGr9mxnBA7AESUps7aBv74MkKrGs9bgbFr", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPPV2iWGtrPcvmQNvPF8eakRPCU6x2t4GWt78srnRTyNy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSDYNcZH5a7vGr9mxnBA7AESUps7aBv74MkKrGs9bgbFr", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1ipRudhpVPJki2QrUDdNrkeYwH9KjkLHJJ"], "tags": ["Uv", "Bodyscapes", "Fluorescent", "Art", "Hand", "Painted", "Rare"], "extra": {}}
