And something desire will turn into a hope where all humans compete to realize that hope. But do all humans have good hope? Maybe yes, but in what way do they realize that hope. From one hope it will give rise to other desires, and make it possible to give rise to fair and petty ways.\n\n\nThis allows us to place the guards within us to defend the fortress of the sanctity of the heart. We must sort out which desires may pass through the gates and prepare to defend the fortress from inciting attacks. It's certainly not easy to do all that. But it can be done by tightening the guard.\n\n\nIN COLLABORATION :\n\n55N/ @faris_momon\nMLYT STUDIO / @soksuperss", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaN1DxEQBD69L68fxxcg6T37qENjrDeaXbhhp9G8jKDJt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeubXSQC1QH2cfopkW2CRA4msAZMXpNS3RfUStgtPq2MC", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaN1DxEQBD69L68fxxcg6T37qENjrDeaXbhhp9G8jKDJt", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1PYL83d8ywQdM2fRaffEiGZgvscfwEeMuZ"], "tags": ["MELAYAT", "indonesianaudio", "55N", "Mankhum", "audio", "guardian", "audio", "gif", "music", "musicodde", "sonnicpi", "soundsystem", "soundshitterm", "noise", "experimental"], "extra": {}}
