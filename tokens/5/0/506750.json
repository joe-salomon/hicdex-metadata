Spiked organic metal parts emerge from sun-bursted micro-explosions, that define light sources. Minute emmanation light beams, float across the whole timespace event, like a parade of the inner-cosmos. Everything that is created, recycles itself, occupying and releasing empty new vaccum spaces of darkness. The flow remains interly present, as the wires of connection expand new worlds.\n.\n2480 x 3508\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRcWvG2oZuGYDyNrG6wVm51AHMUCYnjeLi1NEcF5WZ3Po", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYbC95QDwJYLjyA3uYVsdmKJ42ASEsapW2m2SPBq6rsfT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRcWvG2oZuGYDyNrG6wVm51AHMUCYnjeLi1NEcF5WZ3Po", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1iYNdUSLGD7kf4X8ADkZFxTMSuSfLDDn6g"], "tags": ["hypnacore", "cosmic", "inner-earth", "under-sea", "sleepcore", "vision", "multi-dimensional", ""], "extra": {}}
