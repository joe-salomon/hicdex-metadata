{"__version": 1, "token_id": 505650, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Angelcat and Friends Collection \u2013 Rita Rabbit", "description": "Angel Cat and Friends is about Cheonsa the Cat, an angel cat sent to earth to help fellow animals do good deeds. To disguise herself and do her mission, Cheonsa runs Coffee Cat, a caf\u00e9 that caters to all animals in town. Her most frequent customers are Danny Dog, Rita Rabbit, Paulie Penguin, Chase Chick, Owen Owl and Barry Bear. Each of them has his/her own likes and dislikes as well as good and bad traits. With her yummy food and drinks, little pieces of advice and some help with their needs, Cheonsa inspires them to become better versions of themselves. This NFT is one of Cheonsa's friends and caf\u00e9 customers, Rita Rabbit.\n\nRita Rabbit is a very shy rabbit who runs away as fast as she can when she feels uncomfortable with someone or in a situation. She got her inferiority complex because of her twin sister Reina who is a model-turned-actress. Other animals often mistake her for her twin sister, and being quite an introvert, she often hides herself behind the food she orders at Coffee Cat. Despite being an introvert, she is actually very talented when it comes to a lot of things. She just needs to have the confidence to show others what she can really do.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdpkv6xPy4Z1ZRtzS7iQkbJEcSnCQTgnLM9KotWYrvhj8", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmdpkv6xPy4Z1ZRtzS7iQkbJEcSnCQTgnLM9KotWYrvhj8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdpkv6xPy4Z1ZRtzS7iQkbJEcSnCQTgnLM9KotWYrvhj8", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1QDfxJj5XEpGdnJMEbDYJLMUkpZiHiTUGQ"], "tags": ["collection", "collectibles", "gif", "character", "cute", "animals", "animated", "cartoon", "image", "animatedgif", "rabbit", "bunny", ""], "extra": {}}
