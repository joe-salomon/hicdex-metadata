They are able to match colors and surface textures of their surrounding environments by adjusting the pigment and iridescence of their skin using elastic pigment sacs called chromatophores.\n\nIn this way, the Cuttlefish represents the ability to adapt to any environment or circumstance, much in the same way that Zhuangzi adapted to the death of his wife.\n\nThe classic Daoist parable of Zhuangzi\u2019s wife is included below.\n\nMay this cuttlefish and the story of Zhuangzi's wife bring the ability to adapt to any environment to you, your wallet, and your loved ones.\n\n-----\n\n\u838a\u5b50\u59bb\u6b7b\uff0c\u60e0\u5b50\u5f14\u4e4b\uff0c\u838a\u5b50\u5247\u65b9\u7b95\u8e1e\u9f13\u76c6\u800c\u6b4c\u3002\u60e0\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u8207\u4eba\u5c45\u9577\u5b50\uff0c\u8001\u8eab\u6b7b\uff0c\u4e0d\u54ed\u4ea6\u8db3\u77e3\uff0c\u53c8\u9f13\u76c6\u800c\u6b4c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ea6\u751a\u4e4e\u3002\n\nZhuangzi's wife died. When Huizi went to convey his condolences, he found Zhuangzi sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. \"You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old,\" said Huizi. \"It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing\u2014this is going too far, isn't it?\"\n\n\u838a\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u4e0d\u7136\u3002\u662f\u5176\u59cb\u6b7b\u4e5f\uff0c\u6211\u7368\u4f55\u80fd\u7121\u6982\u7136\u3002\u5bdf\u5176\u59cb\u800c\u672c\u7121\u751f\uff0c\u975e\u5f92\u7121\u751f\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7121\u5f62\uff0c\u975e\u5f92\u7121\u5f62\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7121\u6c23\u3002\u96dc\u4e4e\u8292\u82b4\u4e4b\u9593\uff0c\u8b8a\u800c\u6709\u6c23\uff0c\u6c23\u8b8a\u800c\u6709\u5f62\uff0c\u5f62\u8b8a\u800c\u6709\u751f\uff0c\u4eca\u53c8\u8b8a\u800c\u4e4b\u6b7b\uff0c\u662f\u76f8\u8207\u70ba\u6625\u79cb\u51ac\u590f\u56db\u6642\u884c\u4e5f\u3002\n\nZhuangzi said, \"You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead.
