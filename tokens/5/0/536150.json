This time by adding those words, we've added a new psychological aspect to the work. I realized a new version after reviewing my work a few times. I periodically go back and see if I can improve and/or expand upon older ideas in a new light or fresh take. It doesn't hurt to revisit a classic, just don't get sucked into a nostalgia vortex. Always keep the conversation moving forward.
