DNA disruption occurs when the strands are first unfurled and then slowly snapping each \u2018rung\u2019 to the sequence.\n\nThis causes the victim to slowly and agonisingly implode at varying points of the body, ultimately liquidising the victim from within.\n\nIt is thought there is one that somehow survived the terrifying end to life that is Belatucad Disruptive but it seems that was some time ago and is now considered myth; however, there are Generatives that cling to hope that the myth is real while working to try and identify the bloodline of the survivor. If the survivor is found, it is thought, the Generatives can end the horror of Belatucad D.\n\nThere is one piece of good news about Belatucad D and that is there is only one that exist.\n\nPNG 4800 x 4800 || December 12th 2021 || Dark Art digital painting \u2013 expanding the Gormenghast origin universe\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPvqqnMUYtcbuDKtqss2mChLTuhuGqoqjJ5ni4UGCdFa4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRiMUPSAvhau9mjPT9NBGr1JvCDU8EiWyxBji6u1jn3v1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPvqqnMUYtcbuDKtqss2mChLTuhuGqoqjJ5ni4UGCdFa4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1NWtHHck4dxpwCSGVrboat83R9STyLfmfA"], "tags": ["darkartnftartdigitalpaintinghorrorevilgothicartgothicmetaversegormenghaststevemunrodarkartstudio"], "extra": {}}
