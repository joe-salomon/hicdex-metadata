Variation on a theme. \n\nEarly when I decided to take photographs I am inspired by the work of Josef Koudelka in both \"Gypsies\" and \"Exiles\". Mind you this is before both books are being republished. The plus side of living in Bandung is that we have Selasar Sunaryo, their library are filled with photobooks that you can read freely. I devour it and fell in love with how deceptively simple Koudelka's photos looked and the photobooks as my ultimate photography medium.
