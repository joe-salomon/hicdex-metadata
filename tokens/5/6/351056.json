This was because the men were not supposed to show weakness. They were called \"Carpideiras\". \nThey were not always paid in cash. Often the payment was made with family objects.\nI present my new creation: \"Ascens\u00e3o ao Choro de Carpideiras\". \nDigital art inspired by Xylography.\n\nPurchase for personal use only.
