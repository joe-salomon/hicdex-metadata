{"__version": 1, "token_id": 305556, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Siamese Cat", "description": "The Siamese is one of the oldest breeds of domestic cat and has a history as long and colorful as the cat itself. The Siamese is also (arguably) the most recognizable breed on the planet. According to accounts, these sleek cats with the brilliant blue eyes and outspoken personality originated in Siam (now Thailand), where they lived in palaces and temples. They were treasured as companions of royalty and religious leaders for generations, and served as guardians of precious documents and valuables in the Buddhist temples.\n\nThese sacred cats were thought to inherit transmigrated souls en route to the hereafter. Early legends involving the Siamese are plentiful, including fanciful tales accounting for the cat\u2019s traits. One such story tells how a Siamese temple cat, charged with guarding a valuable vase, curled its tail around the vase and stared at it with such intensity that its eyes became permanently crossed. Another tale tells of Siamese cats appointed to guard precious rings; the cats kept the rings on their tails and kinks developed to keep the rings from sliding off.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXgXZ8ZJt5P9PPFAW5VvdrXMFr2mv5QbqyTxjVZsVmTmA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXgXZ8ZJt5P9PPFAW5VvdrXMFr2mv5QbqyTxjVZsVmTmA", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXgXZ8ZJt5P9PPFAW5VvdrXMFr2mv5QbqyTxjVZsVmTmA", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1agfXzT5Dk59T6H8vRa9BJZR6vSZQT9ZN8"], "tags": ["objkt4objkt", "cat", "pixelart", "pixel", "pet", "animal"], "extra": {}}
