It appears that dootz in each NFT exist within their own Universe, but are bonded directly with each other NFT minted at the same time. Unfortunately we couldn't foresee this result when Doing our initial minting, so when the 7 (14 brave dootz) NFTs were lost, and then seemingly found once again, we knew we needed to run some more tests on willing dootz. Our goal is to get dootz into the hands of every man, woman, and child of this planet, Earth, but only if we can do so safely for our dootz. Thank you for your patience while we conduct the proper tests.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXFgxrxHuKEgAu2JNGKzyUk4VpnsmBNfvi1q7Li39QJm4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXFgxrxHuKEgAu2JNGKzyUk4VpnsmBNfvi1q7Li39QJm4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXFgxrxHuKEgAu2JNGKzyUk4VpnsmBNfvi1q7Li39QJm4", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1VBLwQwtD1jx4hHDx5z5MCqKEb5sMNpoiN"], "tags": ["dootz", "fun", "test", "stationary", "playful", "trapped"], "extra": {}}
