The quintet formed in 1991 as an underground \"backpack\" (People who only listen to underground or conscious rap.) hip-hop act. Closely allied with entire Hieroglyphics Crew, this group had deep, hard hitting beats, lyrics that would incite thoughts of real life, and a type of monotone flow that would rival East Coast legends Gangstarr & Group Home. After making 5 albums and touring for 20 years, the band called it quits. In their absence, a steady following has been building for a decade and word on the street is that they're reforming and putting out a new album.
