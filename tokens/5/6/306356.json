The dogs were in disbelief, could they understand what had happened? As we discovered bones, cooked eels, lost tools from years before revealed at the loss of the grass and melted everything; I realised it was as though I wasn't even there. Though there was a sadness, some shock and awe. All I could do was take pictures and examine the scene from the outside. Even now, nearly two years later, I feel as though the true depths of the aftermath are only unfolding inside me as I write these paragraphs. The shock and awe lingers, as threads of pain are pulled with each word. Coming to a place of releasing the world which once existed before the conversion to dust.\"\n\nPhotography by Jay Moon, during the Australian wildfires; November 2019.\n#14 of 15.\nAll funds generated go toward the ongoing recovery.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWuoGPch2AAYN6kH23pjRgG4xXmqWD9h3hpW1NhXeLwSK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmT9R9uZGWnjgitPfWByUscyextqZuBSauS9CMfyg9wLCQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWuoGPch2AAYN6kH23pjRgG4xXmqWD9h3hpW1NhXeLwSK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2G2NzfXg5JDLcCQxGmToT8goBBGPwo1dtj"], "tags": ["photography", "fire", "australia", "wildfires", "natural"], "extra": {}}
