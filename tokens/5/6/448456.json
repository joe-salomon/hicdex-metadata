His passion for painting gave him the strength to face these hardships.\u00a0We wish to support him through this project and show him that the world appreciates his work and values his resilience as he is yet again forced to re-invent himself.\n\nAbout the collection: Cobalus' Floralia collection is a series of paintings reflecting hope, revival, spring \u2013 a fragile promise of better times that cautiously marks the end of a dark, harsh season. Floralia stands in stark contrast to his other series that are often abstract and tend to revolve around chaos, decay and the all-consuming passing of time.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Cobalus Digital Edition NFT's do not entitle you to the physical painting.
