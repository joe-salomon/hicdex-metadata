{"__version": 1, "token_id": 494256, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Gill Lord - Evil Angler", "description": "Entered via: Darkness rift #19540212\nPower level: Creeper\nSize: 6.6 feet/ 1.98 meters tall\nAspect: Darkness\nSecondary Aspects: Unique\n\nThe Evil Angler is an demonic evolution of the Gill Lords, who has developed bioluminescence in a forehead grown appendage, adapted to saltwater, and grown oversized pupils to deal with even deeper and darker oceanic environments. The Angler loves to sabotage deep sea structures in order to later pick off the poor divers sent to repair them.\n\nA small clan of demons who fell into a deep hibernation in the black, inky depths of an Amazonian lagoon, the Gill Lords have been awoken by the stirrings of the Order of the Dark Wheel. With superhuman strength, regenerative properties and tough scales, the ability to breath underwater and on land, and ancient Devonian claws that can rip a human into shreds, the Gill Lords are amphibious nightmares out of your childhood dreams.\n\nA Gill Lord is an extremely dangerous foe in any aquatic environment due to its aquatic prowess and ability to see in incredibly dark environments. However, because it is susceptible to terrestrial weapons and is relatively slow on land, the Gill Lord is classified as a Creeper.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfBztFryGCA2B6u8caBpThYehLXPx2ETQmD6LuLUBvKJ3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS9DuhzpRXpt7C2ZAeAsyWGQ52aFzpN7ajPPwB4e5LTwc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfBztFryGCA2B6u8caBpThYehLXPx2ETQmD6LuLUBvKJ3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1Tptyp72n38JVuG94HEZXSpKG8w8UGXgrd"], "tags": ["darkwheel", "darkwheeldemon", "darkart", "blacklagoon", "monster", "demon", "horror", "horrorart", "gillman"], "extra": {}}
