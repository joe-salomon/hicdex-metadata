This is a journey of a dog named Diamond, she lost her owner to death. Since the man didn't have relatives, the security guard put her on leash by the leg in the junkyard. Alone, saddened, scared, outside, and soaking wet from the rain looking for warmth, she cried and cried for days. Until one day, a woman rescued her and my very best friend adopted her. Diamond, now is a happy girl.\n\n2400 x 2400px", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUuvp9jyAtQqWAY3RXGzwE7aApRk4jZ3YamzgKUbUkc5A", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUuvp9jyAtQqWAY3RXGzwE7aApRk4jZ3YamzgKUbUkc5A", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUuvp9jyAtQqWAY3RXGzwE7aApRk4jZ3YamzgKUbUkc5A", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz2VgKhJqbt8tpMSxZjKU38jD91m4Hi3VrnP"], "tags": ["illustration", "abstract", "dog", "story"], "extra": {}}
