It became the exclusive religion of this country by a decree of King Filomenus, at the time of the monarchy. It is said that the king, under the effects of the vapors of The Night of the Frogs, saw various creatures who appeared before him and asked to be honored under strange rituals or else the country would burn in flames. \n\nPeppos are hermaphrodite beings that live in swampy areas. When the right rituals are performed, they help and give shelter to the desperate. One of them is the Love Peppo. They are cheeky and elusive. Sometimes they want to appear and sometimes they don't, but when they do, their powers are intense and effective.\n\nThe ritual to honor this Peppo includes candles, Mbuguray flowers macerated in vinegar and the following prayer:\n\n\"Love Peppo give me love Peppo give me love Peppo give me love Peppo(...)\" ad infinitum or until love appears.
