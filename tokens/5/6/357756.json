I think it doesn't matter what you think in your life, bitter or sweet. It is important to have a new look and get over old ideas. I use painting to present my creativity. In the artworks I create, I apply my ideas with creativity and various techniques on different materials with forms that have been borrowed from the basics of Iranian calligraphy and nature, far from some limitations of them. The accompaniment, harmony and contrast of warm-cold and complementary colors in my works, which are indebted to nature, has always been an endless pleasure for me, which I have experienced over and over again. Also, embracing colors with forms of Iranian calligraphy and nature with a combination of acrylic and watercolor painting techniques on different materials with ups and downs, dark and light and intertwined forms call the audience unconsciousness to challenge their mind and feelings.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUzKNHvwzorVLStP893cuhykiNS19ir8D5qvQ1uyqR3UU", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYppo6LQFk5BAd1kPE9nV1uymbry3QBPnTAskCFXECRvr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUzKNHvwzorVLStP893cuhykiNS19ir8D5qvQ1uyqR3UU", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1Xh3ztFnrnLC5ZCshGNtuNLhMpse8krFuG"], "tags": ["ideaartworksillustrationpsychedelicndesignprocessingpencilbrowntreeartgeometricmotioncolornftgiveawaysnftscharacterinfluenftcalligraphypaintingiraniancalligraphybirdsanimationabstractwatercolortouchdesignercalligraphycollimationmodernnftcollectorcreativityhen200kblack&whiteblackandwhiteglitchartfeelitrippychameleonsnatureacrylicmotiongraphicpaintingnftcolorfultechniquesirannftsnoiseanimalharmonycleannft"], "extra": {}}
