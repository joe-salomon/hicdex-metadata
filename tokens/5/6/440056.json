The parents' pressure, along with the children's concern over achievement, led one of the youngsters to stammer. Despite her elder sister's academic achievement and good social ties, the younger sister would stutter and then vomit anytime she tried to talk to her because her tongue was caught in her throat. When I told her family that it would be good to see a psychologist, they said that they had been seeing a psychologist for a while because she pissed her bed at night. I'm sure they'd never accept that they were the source of the problem. And there was no way I was going to be able to save that youngster from the child abuse.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWRCpvNDiMXATJeLrQQ78MeXu98qW7FfJs34Nk2Lnp5L1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWRCpvNDiMXATJeLrQQ78MeXu98qW7FfJs34Nk2Lnp5L1", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWRCpvNDiMXATJeLrQQ78MeXu98qW7FfJs34Nk2Lnp5L1", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1dZDMAtyxM9nowWZm589fNAx3PXPtD9ZLX"], "tags": ["gif", "collectible", "collectibles", "photography", "experimental", "doodle", "sketch"], "extra": {}}
