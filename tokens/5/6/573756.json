The main temples are in the cities of Sippar and Larsa. He is believed to have ascended to heaven in a sun chariot and seen all that happened on that day. He is an enforcer of divine justice and is thought to help those in distress. According to Sumerian mythology, he helped protect Dumuzid when the galla demon tried to drag him into the Underworld and he appeared to the hero Ziusudra after the Great Flood. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, he helps Gilgamesh defeat the ogre Humbaba.\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdB95c1X89fhXBcUBELm3muguzDtgJw8dM3X3RijwhG5F", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUBDxcQkoztoWY84XTduW1xu8pSaQyChPxGwXqP62NdSK", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdB95c1X89fhXBcUBELm3muguzDtgJw8dM3X3RijwhG5F", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1bvi4gXVcBHPV5QPoVAbzBtRE5qcXJcpfU"], "tags": ["destroyxstairs", "trip", "retro", "collage", "collagedigital", "sci-fi", "vintage", "galaxy", "creativeobjkt", "digitalcollagepsychedelic", "space", "retrocollage", "surreal", "collageimage"], "extra": {}}
