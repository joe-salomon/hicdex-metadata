{"__version": 1, "token_id": 455956, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Void", "description": "One has inadvertently opened the gates of the inner vision and finds themselves lost in the void. Floating free in the infinite eternal spacetime of darkness, a single point of light coalesced from incomprehensible vibrations remains present and yet somehow is not there. Suspended outside of all sense beyond the feeling that remains, the zero-gravity entity looks deep into the supernovae and guiding stars to glimpse an unknown code embedded deep in the fabric of being and indecipherable in its cascading intensity of pattern and form. What does it all mean they ask themselves.\n\nExclusive Edition High Resolution JPEG 5990\u200a\u00d7\u200a7790", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWNAud4b2mcbjBG23x1B3TH7ogMT3HJjAGiQTg1kBukF5", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeBZTv3aZJvi2AzjFoavBK5Z4CznZL1vP1WZQzcqG9PSV", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWNAud4b2mcbjBG23x1B3TH7ogMT3HJjAGiQTg1kBukF5", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eHyPPPecPT2xN7YU2kv9enMUUVNsNEMeR"], "tags": ["digital", "collage", "painting", "illustration", "space", "psychedelic", "mystical"], "extra": {}}
