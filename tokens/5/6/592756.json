Complexion bold and brazen. He is a God in his own right. The villagers all agree.\nEverything is within his reach. \n\nHis knuckles grind slowly in the earth as he feels the pain and triumph of each of his people. Brothers and Sisters are all his kin. He holds the tokens of the future and the keys of the past. Respect is a word too simple , Honour is his brand.\n\nSoldiers form around him never trespassing upon his shadow. He watches over all and all watch over him. \n\nThe keeper of a nation. A Father and Brotherhood of kindness and humanity.\n\nGod has Blessed Baba.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf6fArGc7sCkNrM9ungAu4bdNhB6K7pJxhcd4TRdZiHuP", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRXZzGBHhVUjSAw1EFLNXzJozEwVWLogAgKogowR4vpnU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf6fArGc7sCkNrM9ungAu4bdNhB6K7pJxhcd4TRdZiHuP", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1UXPeDzfhtXfSFT796Zby3VKWfmTC5pavU"], "tags": ["AI", "words", "art", "vqgan", "prose", "vqgan+clip"], "extra": {}}
