The well of ideas, matter and life.\n\nCreation. The cycle of birth and death. You are flowing with the river anyway. Stop fighting it. Stop trying to swim up river. Flow with the movement of your life. It comes from it and it goes to it, what happens in-between is what you are experiencing now. Be completely in this moment, hear, listen to whatever is around you. Feel what you are connected to. The chair, the ground, the touch of the fabric on your clothes. Notice the colours, the forms, the shapes and the textures around you. It all came from somewhere, the plant grew from a tiny seed and now covers the roof.\n\nSomething is coming into being on the physical plane. Something is being created in your life by the Universe that you have wanted. \n\nAllow it to happen.\n\nThe Dreaming Pool Oracle is a collaboration between artists Maia Mellier \ud83d\udd78 \ud83d\udd77 (@maiamellier) & AEVIN (@aevin_io)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZRbSSaYRDan9hrtsgEKsjxm1QJi2ZFAgnh7vk8PKRFX7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZTBqUmcsnaB7xix3A9Ydei5B3saJpipNnwgBSmg4xsL8", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZRbSSaYRDan9hrtsgEKsjxm1QJi2ZFAgnh7vk8PKRFX7", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1SEkFv8ibFsKzi3AgAfkAKDc5La329LJAy"], "tags": ["generativeart", "cards", "aevin", "maiamellier", "p5js", "collectable", "illustration", "blackandwhite", "interactive", "oraclecards"], "extra": {}}
