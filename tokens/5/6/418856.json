This mimic takes up that spirit by building upon the bottom of an aluminum can as a form for its cap.\n\nSymbolically, the fly agaric is a gateway; it has been known to alter one\u2019s perceptions, which is what working with the blockchain has done for me. It seems fitting for me to use it as a subject my experiments with making art for the blockchain.\n\nOne of the themes that I explore in my work is mimicking other objects in other mediums, and in thinking about how to format that into something that can be minted, I decided to compose the mimic into an environment that the objects being mimicked are found.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmS3HMv9G5WbgVAxdfjAUvjtYZ95H8AjH6noKDo61Mrx8Z", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmSCrZHKfyjzGySFEdoSttrrNXU8ZoMYMhpi7jUCsXJqAH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmS3HMv9G5WbgVAxdfjAUvjtYZ95H8AjH6noKDo61Mrx8Z", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1U9g5rCG45oweVJG3aQoB9bLSk5n5a3JZN"], "tags": ["craftmedia", "glass"], "extra": {}}
