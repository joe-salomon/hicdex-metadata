In this case, it's definitely NOT a waste of time. I enjoy creating these word pyramid structures for reasons mentioned in the previous page, but also because work like this helps to soothe the mind. It's easy on the eyes as most of the information is the same. Colors always play a huge role in terms of the emotional feel for each work as well as compositionally. I couldn't think of better colors to go with a deep blue / black than yellow / orange / and dark orange. Color theory is such an important aspect of art and design. What kind of story are we trying to project or protect? I use it every single day in every single artwork; if you don't have the right colors, you won't have the right result at the end. It's that simple. My suggestion is make as many variations of something as possible, or at least imagine it if you're able to.
