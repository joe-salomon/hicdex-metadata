A height map or height field is a raster image used mainly as Discrete Global Grid in secondary elevation modelings. Each pixel stores values, such as surface elevation data, for display in 3D computer graphics. A height map can be used in bump mapping to calculate where this 3D data would create shadow in a material, in displacement mapping to displace the actual geometric position of points over the textured surface, or for terrain where the height map is converted into a 3D mesh.\n\nHeightmaps are an ideal way to store digital terrain elevations; compared to a regular polygonal mesh, they require substantially less memory for a given level of detail.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUmLDAN2k8hgiZMd3qPQYKQ5tQZ3bWg38XBnjrF1cpQ9D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUGLwygbg6h9EP3hDXasPvanDGdCBBYDEnRGSUVVi3Jtw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUmLDAN2k8hgiZMd3qPQYKQ5tQZ3bWg38XBnjrF1cpQ9D", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1TtsD76dp6B5agbmBDP79VXnLFkgPJ3Tpk"], "tags": ["objkt4objkt", "objkt", "generativeart", "abstract", "movie", "color", "tesoz", "art", "nftart", "Magic", "sphere", "hen", "motion", "3d", "soothing", "relaxation"], "extra": {}}
