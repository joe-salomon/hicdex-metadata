Please don\u2019t get burned out and have enough rests. Eat some yummy apple pies and clam chowders for better snuggles and sleeps. I\u2019ve been packing up some extra feet muscles since living with Bubblebones. We\u2019ve been skipping together to get to work, get groceries, and other shenanigans. Sometimes if I get too tired, Percy the Nessie lets me ride on his back. He\u2019s Bubblebones\u2019 trusty pet. I want one for my own, but housing nowdays don\u2019t accomodate pets that are 25 feet long. bummer.\n\nGonna skip some more now to get swole. Housing options are still very much welcome if you have some. Until then, don\u2019t litter and don\u2019t forget to get some fresh air! hop hoppity hop\n\nLove,\nJetson Humble", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmWw5BQsh82xHFVWfKhkEs7dHJBZBvT7cHCLP4MrtFGRBX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWRKVy6mhkXPieKzxY1sgrvuT3ic97wyj78oYAXr1zzxm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmWw5BQsh82xHFVWfKhkEs7dHJBZBvT7cHCLP4MrtFGRBX", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2VhS8sqnFFCGr7VppXtHyGRmJMAA49enEZ"], "tags": ["Jetson", "Rabbit", "Bunny", "Colorful", "Axolotl"], "extra": {}}
