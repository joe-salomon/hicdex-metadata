For that reason, I wrote a sad melody for the Oboe to play. This instrument brings a natural melancholy.\nIt is worth noting that the piano accompaniment has minor second and major second intervals, this creates a tension to accompany the sad melody of the oboe and the violin.\n \nThe instruments used in this composition were: Oboe, Piano, Violin and Synthesizer\n \nBig extra points are awarded to those who notice that the melody of 0:58 seconds is the same melody as the main theme.\n\nMusic mixed and mastered in .wav 24 bits / 48.000hz\n\nVisual art is about \"traveling\" in thought.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZU2JsPQM7WCtXhM1zSgVKpKvyVLP49oyN2sBQmHm4Qdf", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcu2Si1gNoHuN4WbuGWgEKMpLquNvkvAgj8JkMhBw6qJc", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZU2JsPQM7WCtXhM1zSgVKpKvyVLP49oyN2sBQmHm4Qdf", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VeVAQXKpKTweqkPBpN2NHxYyhEtP5zELH"], "tags": ["classical", "classic", "theme", "music", "song", "composition", "instrumental", "soundtrack", "movietheme", "leitmotif", "sonata"], "extra": {}}
