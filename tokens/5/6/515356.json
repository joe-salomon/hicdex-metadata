{"__version": 1, "token_id": 515356, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Gliderworld", "description": "This uses a chemical potential model, though not an equilibrium one, to let the current configuration of the field decide how much of each of the 16 different materials it wants to have at each location. Material attempts to randomly jump to new cells, but the jump is only allowed if the affinity of the new site for that material is higher than the old. Because jumps change the configuration of the field, the affinities also change, and the model avoids equilibrium. / @ngutten\n\n2560 x 1440 mp4", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTqsQegkx3ydxiAreDSdBFYY8jP5mT9tb7H7qt9THrPEK", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb5tR93xT7Bpivrfx7kCwtZ4zoTdRCjGfELuvwuoWo6LU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTqsQegkx3ydxiAreDSdBFYY8jP5mT9tb7H7qt9THrPEK", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1SWsPUdLvr4KCuZxN69ju2bZruggLbYhjx"], "tags": ["simulation", "cellularautomaton", "diffusion", "gliders", "video"], "extra": {}}
