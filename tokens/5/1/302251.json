I hope that you continue to fight because somehow I know that there's still that cry in your heart that you wanted to live, that you can still endure what shit life will throw you. I know that even if it's painful for you to breathe for another second and you're just so tired of living just for another day, I know you can get through all those shit! I know that you fought so hard to conquer your silent battles! I know that you spent those sleepless nights crying because you felt like you don't know how you'll face everyone and continue to act like you're okay! I know that you can get through it, because you're a fighter. You're a warrior. You understand that those are just life's way of making a strong person out of you, because calm seas don't make a strong captains. Error, failures, disappointment, and pain does.\n\nArtist: Jovierose | 3456 x 2592 | Noir Photographs |", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeigpgp3kdcx4qwd77wmtgqr3p3mt7w5phzakgfnbtsvaufnimkmcii", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreigyjn3kcld2f5h3juhpij2icddp2omaomtzv6solcwb7o5xa3yneq", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeigpgp3kdcx4qwd77wmtgqr3p3mt7w5phzakgfnbtsvaufnimkmcii", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1PyL35gcf2t84KqcAYatKgwRyYchf8FKjC"], "tags": ["BlackandWhiteFlower", "FlowerPhotography", "NoirPhotographs", "CanonPhotography", "NFTPhotography"], "extra": {}}
