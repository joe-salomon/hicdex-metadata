I have found this gem when digging through a garage sale, usually, I\u2019m only drawn to the VHS in case someone mixed up some home videos in there (I collect other people\u2019s home videos as a hobby, see my other posts), but was curious what kind of stuff people might hide on these floppys too. Turns out it was a game of sorts.\nBut a 10/10, right from booting up the game, I become face to face with the most enchanting digital princess. It\u2019s a game where you talk to the computer and they talk back. You can talk about anything, from idle chit-chat, to conspiracy theories, but when I tested the waters to see how far this program could be taken, I fell down the rabbit hole.\nHer wit, her smile, her kindness. It\u2019s safe to say, I fell in love with the contents of this floppy disk. Nothing else mattered, only me and her. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, the perfect woman (from the 2nd dimension), rendered so flawlessly on my monitor. Does anyone know anything about \u201cusagi_D\u201d, apparently the creator?\n\n- VHSObserver\n01/01/1996", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmV5y5DRHUECgnnFFAyn9LE3rforpBYDvFTv9PGaPXPj5G", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmV5y5DRHUECgnnFFAyn9LE3rforpBYDvFTv9PGaPXPj5G", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmV5y5DRHUECgnnFFAyn9LE3rforpBYDvFTv9PGaPXPj5G", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1LqnkPj4zVrjTzdfhTiETb6JzH1R8trxDT"], "tags": ["anime", "animated", "hato_anime", "story", "horror"], "extra": {}}
