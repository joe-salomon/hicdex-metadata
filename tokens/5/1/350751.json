Occasionally a wisp takes off from one sphere to fly to\nanother. The sounds of tinkling ice crystals, creaking stabilizers and\nthe drones of wisps sailing past are laid above the constant swoosh of the wind.\n\nAs the sun starts to set, the skies take on a reddish tone, heralding the beginning\nof a violent dust storm. Clouds of dust pummel the colony spheres, St. Elmo\u2019s fire\ngiving them an eerie glow in the darkening night skies. The friction from the dust\ncauses the occasional lightning to light up the skies, the rumble following a few\nseconds later.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPUHFszdiziPeGR4VeShums2SxKCDQrJgz19Nqr7ap2sq", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXbj1ajHfqGU5H5N1LEVhRg8HRwz3p4DGBNojsp9iZYbk", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPUHFszdiziPeGR4VeShums2SxKCDQrJgz19Nqr7ap2sq", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz2KhKnTtNyDnYzvHLATmwCcRvsthG1J6NWy"], "tags": ["shader", "interactive", "motionblur", "spinners"], "extra": {}}
