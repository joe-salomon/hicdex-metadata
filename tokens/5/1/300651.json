Otherwise we are all the same, bodies made of flesh and bone. The only thing that separates us from each other is the nature of our hearts. If you have a pure and beautiful heart, it is reflected outside. But if you are a dark, envious person who wants everyone's evil, the evil of your heart will be reflected on your face again. And even if you are beautiful in the world, the darkness of your heart will overshadow your beauty. \n\nMade with Procreate app.\n4096x4096px - 10MB", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiap7bhzvlvpkmqmpkh4yxztffp2fq6s64cuueibolcnonkxjytcsa", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreiap4lqadr36dnl2af27evkin2unuk2uum5d3dvt5oczinbbqz2tvu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiap7bhzvlvpkmqmpkh4yxztffp2fq6s64cuueibolcnonkxjytcsa", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1PGDAcf4dX81qv8XTY6HoWirZxJvUNA3Nd"], "tags": ["portrait", "girl", "beauty", "illustration", "digital", "art", "collectables"], "extra": {}}
