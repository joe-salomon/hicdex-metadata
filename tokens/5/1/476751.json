Each of these words are 6 letters long for a total length of 12 letters. Starting from the top we have A & O, which are valid words and each line down can create its own new word. From the use of a pink/magenta like color we can see waves forming within the word HEARTHSTONES. If we look at the very definition of hearthstone, we have several meanings, one of which is: family life; the home. The color wave represents the beating heart of the family; the home. Not many words in the English language allow for such possibilities, but they exist. It always makes me think of the concept of family and how important my family is to me. That's why this one is special. I hope you find it special for you and your family.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTcaoHEW4Mr1nhHAM1GTJxWSZUvvybWRQmqCrYyje37oF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdLUwgr2FtXhVEb5KR4jWWricfkEad4GMv2fSCdfsV3SF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTcaoHEW4Mr1nhHAM1GTJxWSZUvvybWRQmqCrYyje37oF", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
