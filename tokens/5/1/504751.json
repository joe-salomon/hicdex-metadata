{"__version": 1, "token_id": 504751, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Now I Can See the Moon", "description": "The 17th century Japanese poet and Samurai Mizuta Masahide once wrote: \u201cBarn\u2019s burnt down -- now I can see the moon.\u201d Hence the title. I thought about that poem as I photographed a ramshackle barn in southwestern Michigan. My resulting artwork, a photo-based montage literally and metaphorically depicts the spirit of Masahide\u2019s words. From the rubble will spring a new vista for viewing the beautiful countryside. From the foundation a new structure will be built, only to age and decay, allowing the moon to shine once again before the next cycle of destruction and decay, opportunity and renewal. This artwork was juried into a gallery exhibition called \u201cBroken Beauty.\u201d\n\nAbout the View Portal\nThe \u201cview portal\u201d that frames the image is a photograph of an industrial window in a renovated cookie factory. The window provides a gateway into fanciful realms where you can explore worlds familiar and unknown. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQkv6m2UX7pfAeWsGuguWeRy3C6EPGgKPagkgmSuFxaPT", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUoPp8vwS1fbUqiKGDHpuwk6i8UihBs5Hsp557YLk4gKs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQkv6m2UX7pfAeWsGuguWeRy3C6EPGgKPagkgmSuFxaPT", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1LyqA6KX1sLH2ZcCLTzEnSWiijY4NCiySQ"], "tags": ["fullmoon", "barn", "compositephoto", "surrealart", "birds"], "extra": {}}
