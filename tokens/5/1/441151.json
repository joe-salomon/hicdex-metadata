I mean like walk, walk. Like for an hour or so, just you and the rain. It's a humbling experience.(What's the art here Andrew?) That experience is the art. In this moment of submission to the elements, your ancestors are crying advice to you. You haven't been listening. Listen harder, you can hear them. If you try it, look up and open your eyes. The water that hits your eyes makes you instantly tear up. You're tearing their tears. You're feeling what they felt. All the water that we drink, bath in, tear out, sweat out, spit up/out, swim in, all of it is the same they did. They're returning to you. They're telling you their secrets, their dreams, their wonders, their successes, their losses, their advice from past lives. All of it to you and one day your tears will join theirs for future generations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmceHS5sXPPgHVgEyVakusGFn3Qoy7PWtfkw5kXRy8T46K", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQQ69NchAYxRLfkic8YeaGD5CJq6TeYRaMbrYLKGj5bxf", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmceHS5sXPPgHVgEyVakusGFn3Qoy7PWtfkw5kXRy8T46K", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
