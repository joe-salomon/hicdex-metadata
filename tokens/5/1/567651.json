The decision to strike was technically illegal, as there had been no national ballot of NUM members, even though the Nottinghamshire and Midlands Coalfields for example, had called for a national ballot. Miners in Yorkshire and Kent were the first to go on strike, followed by miners in Scotland, South Wales and Durham. Britain was to witness a fierce, hard fought battle involving the government, police, press, and the NUM.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmX6K8r8uB6kPZmL6WkhzkpxoN3zyBWqZ9azrrFTD4n6zM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXp9Q1AD4ThKKSA7sWYqghyjy7fW7yNwrdbNjetFQYjKb", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmX6K8r8uB6kPZmL6WkhzkpxoN3zyBWqZ9azrrFTD4n6zM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1e3TV8PBSQ2EsZdaZjiEsrmXnfQCL7xrTX"], "tags": ["nottingham", "miners", "rally", "strike", "1984", "march"], "extra": {}}
