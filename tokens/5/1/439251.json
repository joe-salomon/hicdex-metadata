For at least half an hour he does not change position, staring at the ground. He could almost be invisible if it were not for his glaringly bright hoodie casting him into sharp relief against the dark hedge. \n\nThe monochromatic, grainy nature of these shots lends a sense of anonymity to the subjects, people who are so often treated as invisible despite the fact that they are living in plain sight. By placing people experiencing homelessness as the central subject of this series, we are forced to confront the lived realities of homelessness and urban poverty as experienced around the world. \n\n102,400 represents the ISO or Film Speed that my camera is set to capture these images.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbnbTGjpderFEf5ePWgtFromxtn1ESQKuqLp5bLrsSX9n", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRQTyiCuqesvsiDyY1kgPiYh3x5ziJDWrmWcrctYVgKni", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbnbTGjpderFEf5ePWgtFromxtn1ESQKuqLp5bLrsSX9n", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2Fm2Ax1h2cAuFo996rptPW279HSzThdzSy"], "tags": ["homeless", "street", "streetphotography", "mono", "blackandwhite", "bnw", "grain", "australia", "adelaide"], "extra": {}}
