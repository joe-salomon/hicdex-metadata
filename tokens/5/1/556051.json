In the year 1492, the territories now known as Latin America were conquered. \n \n\u201cWhen he left Spain, Columbus took a boat full of plants, flowers, animals, people and bacteria. When he landed in the Americas, he unleashed all of these on the new terrain, which lead to the destruction of indigenous plants and animals, and the spread of disease. \n\nThe people of Meso America, the Aztec in Mexico and the Inca in Peru succumbed to the conquistadors\u2019 weaponry, which was also biological. About six million died of smallpox\u201d, says Musemwa. \n\nThe political empire-building that took hold in Latin America also transformed the local ecology. The environmental impact of maize production on African soil is significant. If not managed properly, it causes soil degradation and erosion, destruction of wildlife and plant biodiversity, loss of food crop diversity, and climate change. \n\nIts dependence on irrigation and its low tolerance for drought is a concern in water scarce regions. \n\nThe demand for and profitability of cotton were such that most smaller farms and plantations in this region had single-crop systems.\n\nOn the largest and most self-sufficient plantations, however, corn was also raised in abundance, largely as a staple for the people who were enslaved's diet. Corn was usually planted at the end of the cotton cycle and harvested in the fall.'", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbGnb6N5v8E5bTybVpwzPgs9VjY2xuk8GQ4ZTravU1A9i", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmb1R1BsqrNkGCwt2fnQAQBtR5JzFSNtVCspRE5XJEfbun", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbGnb6N5v8E5bTybVpwzPgs9VjY2xuk8GQ4ZTravU1A9i", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1VgqNwFGVU5yEew5WkiySscP2Smv5aZbUa"], "tags": ["animalfarmoyx", "digitalillustration", "brazilianartist", "nature", "animal", "surreal", "colorful"], "extra": {}}
