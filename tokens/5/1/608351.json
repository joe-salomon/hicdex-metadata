FIRST DAY of Month 4. While I was out today I saw this arcade cabinet sitting on the sidewalk sorta near my house. I was driving so I had to stop and check it out. The back was gone, the guts were ALL gone. My friend Mike knows arcade cabs and said the shell is pretty much worthless. It was tough to see something so cool stripped down to its bare bones and left on the curb for the trash. The glass was still there but the artwork was all scratched up so not worth taking. I so badly wanted to find a reason to salvage it.
