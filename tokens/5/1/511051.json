Although the British Museum expected delivery of the antiquity in 1818, the Younger Memnon did not arrive in London until 1821. Shelley published his poems before the statue fragment of Ozymandias arrived in Britain.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQbDtgx4GtvnFB98Ei83VZX5me8JKcfqZ2ssqPFHAeidK", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmWWjHS168G5BFiydzroHdAgoUbUtkHjyix73rnMwwqhUe", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQbDtgx4GtvnFB98Ei83VZX5me8JKcfqZ2ssqPFHAeidK", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WGcQQNn8gApMjkcFysujWGvdJH5qF8J8Z"], "tags": ["3d", "art", "digital", "vvsvs", "digitalart", "3dart", "human", "vitruvian", "woman"], "extra": {}}
