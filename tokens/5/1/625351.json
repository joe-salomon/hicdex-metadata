{"__version": 1, "token_id": 625351, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Bubbles of Life", "description": "The bubbles supply oxygen-rich air for the eggs and hatchlings of wild betta fishes, which dwell in shallow waters with little oxygen. As a result, it serves as both protection and a healthy habitat for hatchlings who are unable to safely reach more oxygen-rich places or the surface. The bubbles are created by gulping air at the surface and then producing saliva bubbles. These are frequently buried behind leaves or other floating debris to shield the eggs from predators at the surface, such as insects.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXikQJz72cY2jgueSoeFM8HCsftmZLL9ZexGScGxtjAnD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP9Hgdr6DrUHauF6Xpy1P3tKd7yuBZhCkMc7YbMfrRsdW", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXikQJz72cY2jgueSoeFM8HCsftmZLL9ZexGScGxtjAnD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WCetZiRF8KpYkdM6ZyGsbbdHrrxbn8433"], "tags": ["life", "bubbles", "photography", "microscope", "fish"], "extra": {}}
