January 14th is the birthday of my good friends from Dalektown Tonny and Joeh and todays design is dedicated to them and their Yeti \u2014 but x2 because they are twins. This design will be open for 24 hrs and once time has elapsed the remaining pieces will be burned. Half of all proceeds from this piece will go back to the Cheesehead DOA.
