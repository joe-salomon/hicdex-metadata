I am a graphic designer afterall so I guess I shouldn't be surprised about this. I am and have always been drawn to typography in a commercial sense. Without fail no matter where I go I end up taking shots of innocuous lettering. Most end up not meaning all that much to me but every time I see this pink box it reminds me of where my fathers family and ancestors are from, and reminds me of how much I love and need my wife. Me getting arrested was the end of 1 chapter, and this Leonard's box reminds me what came next.
