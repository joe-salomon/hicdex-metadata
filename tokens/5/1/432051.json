What does LET IT GO mean? It literally could mean a gazillion things. In the case of this work, it's letting go of the past. Let go of hate. Let go of fear. Let go of materialism. Let go attachment. Let go of Ex's. Let go your perception of control. Let go of greed. Let go of wanton selfishness. Let it all go. That doesn't mean letting go of yourself. Your body and mind are one. Don't let go of hope. Don't let go of love. Don't let go of your strength. Don't let go of what makes you great. Live in the moment; be present to now, which leads into the next phase.
