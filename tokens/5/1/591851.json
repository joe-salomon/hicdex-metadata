Her son was obsessed with all things mech related, and she could never say no when he flashed his infectious grin. After all the boy became quite adept in mechanical engineering and Constance loved that he fooled himself into learning.\n\nThe duo were inseparable. After many amateur mech battles, they landed their first official fight in the arena. Unfortunately, tragedy separated the two with fiery indifference. All Constance had left was her son's favourite red bandana.\n\nFrom that day forward she dedicated her pilot career to preventing such tragedy from happening again. Sporting that red bandana, she battled the best pilots and defeated them in turn. On her way to the top she took many an amateur pilot under her wing. After decades of nurturing everyone that passed through the arena, she became known to all simply as Mom.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbsneYyQ4JZmup2cXUH5voZXLZGxqYziBAKyjmZi8VEds", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmcwc512ogguguqpTR1PU8paxnEvg9B8gc3iNqvXdbowCy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbsneYyQ4JZmup2cXUH5voZXLZGxqYziBAKyjmZi8VEds", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1MY1BKQd2QFDDsjCpkKi6vVDxPKycGiJA3"], "tags": ["Mom", "Mech", "Vessels", "Heart"], "extra": {}}
