Emptiness, depression, anxiety, are factors that lead to hopelessness for the life that is being lived.  all meaningless actions, all expectations poisoned with inferiority.  This poem is written in Indonesian.  To make it easier for you, I provide a translation in English.  maybe this English does not cover the whole meaning (because of the difference in meaning equivalent), but hopefully the essence of this poem is conveyed.\n\nDancing in the Fireplace\n\n2.\n\nThey came\nI was trapped\n\nThe walls of the ego world\nAmbition to finish is instinct\n\nI run\nHide\nDisappear\n\nNumb\nHit by the instinct to save myself\nCornered with the carcass\nAs a long-dead victim\nI can't handle the emotions of the earth \nI'm not here\n\nWhere the eye gazes upon the senses\nAnd time is no longer valid: \nI Die.\n\nArifansdr\n2017.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQzWnKTQgDNprJThoUwwacAfmBmmi16sCdyP3cerdo4Ez", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmU765MUEnBZbpLa5iUFSKLgvKrYqNVcuP5xvJEmn7yWhR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQzWnKTQgDNprJThoUwwacAfmBmmi16sCdyP3cerdo4Ez", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz28f36EsUqgfUBVUvBq5KsmSWRqdrfD8mnC"], "tags": ["Arifansdr", "menaridiperapian", "poetric", "poem", "photography", "blacknwhite"], "extra": {}}
