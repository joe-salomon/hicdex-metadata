{"__version": 1, "token_id": 422751, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "PRETENSION, PT. IV", "description": "Jerry Saltz, Senior Art Critic at The New York Times said, \"Bad art and bad writing teach you as much as good art and good writing.\" He goes on to say, \"Faulkner said, \"Read, read, read. Read everything: trash, classics, good and bad.\" Artists: Look, look, look. Look at everything: trash, classics, good and bad.\" What can we extrapolate from his wisdom and by proxy, William Faulkner's? For one, there is so much content out there to choose from. Everyone has an opinion and everyone (for the most part) has a set of eyes to look. It's important to be exposed to lots of different forms of expression to gain a bigger scope of what art is and what it can be. Bad art is amazing in it's own right. As stated on a previous page, bad actually creates the gauge of what is actually good. Great thanks for the pedantic bombastic balderdash Andrew what's the point and how is this work art? Geez...tough crowd here. We have something of opposites at play here using the concepts of full and less in alternating fashion downward. When we look at art sometimes our thoughts, feelings, insights vacillate between our own gut reactions and the opinions of others. Sometimes our gut instinct is correct and sometimes we're way off and vice verse when it comes to the opinions of others. The point is to find a balance between what you believe and the opinions of others. The way to increase your competency in art is to read, read, read & look, look, look.
