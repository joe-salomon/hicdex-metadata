Many Dutch, European, and later also Indonesian artists at that time only painted paintings depicting the natural beauty of the Dutch East Indies with the aim to attract tourism.\n\nS. Sudjojono, the father of modern Indonesian art, said Mooi Indie only depicts beautiful, peaceful, romantic, heavenly, and serene scenery in the Indies or Indonesia, which is actually very different from the real conditions of society during the colonial period. He considers the Mooi Indie paintings to be nothing more than entertainment for foreigners.\n\nAnimated Digital Collage\nfinished on January 14, 2022\nVideo\n8 second (looping)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTQn3WDVradiSy8YXHHUxUa7EdGwgBJUKJZvje2YchKvz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPPQdsA6vJz1QH1AiAJNrNcZ9iM3eMp4HjxKeR8F4bnRR", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTQn3WDVradiSy8YXHHUxUa7EdGwgBJUKJZvje2YchKvz", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1av3PU2PNW6WxHVZuVSAwjbySs7McRLEFB"], "tags": ["collage", "jurnalkolasefrnss", "animation", "colonialism", ""], "extra": {}}
