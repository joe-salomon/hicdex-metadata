This work is about the last bit of mystery between two strangers. It\u2019s a warm summer night and time seems to have stopped. But then the sun rises, and you never meet again.\nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTKcfYN8jKySQN25zrvvbNsozb2RWgP8HEm155Dz1rH4a", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcEAmME35RXGd4PPZnDjz9T4ZD6x7j1zsqQ9kVytqP9As", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTKcfYN8jKySQN25zrvvbNsozb2RWgP8HEm155Dz1rH4a", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "feelings", "mystery", "strangers"], "extra": {}}
