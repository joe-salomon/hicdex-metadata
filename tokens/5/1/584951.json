As children, when we tried to work out how these virtual experiences came to be, we were not knowledgeable enough to understand how that process worked. In our investigation of Nintendogs (2005), we began to ask ourselves how we got so absorbed into a world that wasn't real.\n\nNintendogs was a pet simulation game released in 2005 to promote the Nintendo DS Console. When reflecting on our childhood experience with the game, we remembered how emotionally attached we were to these virtual \"pets\". Even though we were aware that these dogs were digital, our engagement with this simulation repeatedly blurred the line between what was real and what was artificial. As a result, simulations were as relevant to our lived experience as anything in the physical world.\n\nWe dissected our original gaming experience and used it to create new work that helps bridge the gap between consumer and producer by exposing the hollow mesh of our close pet.\n\nThis is a work of creative appropriation and full credits go to to Nintendo for the Shiba Inu mesh that we have used and destroyed.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZaDw8VNGyFHV8jkdwkWiumqoZD6w5R16RaRMJu7PYtzX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZaDw8VNGyFHV8jkdwkWiumqoZD6w5R16RaRMJu7PYtzX", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZaDw8VNGyFHV8jkdwkWiumqoZD6w5R16RaRMJu7PYtzX", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1hmeoH2zZEF3Xm1KadXQvsD11YmVcfnctA"], "tags": ["nintendonintendogsappropriationnewaestheticpostinternetglitchnewabstractionglitchartist"], "extra": {}}
