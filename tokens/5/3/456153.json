I have arrived at this place by mistake, this cannot be the place. I don't know what happened, I just woke up here, I feel confused and hurt, but also terrified.\nMy forced landing was on something that I cannot describe with simple words, I feel that it breathes, it observes me, that it complains, that it yells at me. It is definitely alive.\nI sense that it doesn't like my presence. I am trapped here and I fear for my life.\nI hope this blog serves to come for me. Let it be soon, because I am certain that they will only find my corpse.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmP1nSKUTWpVCrCk6VcFuqYgPi8JFyRdwdHiaTH3nL7Hgz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUf9hyWXMMVrjZQaMkwQX21j3oNUtVj67JnLs3ra7jRpw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmP1nSKUTWpVCrCk6VcFuqYgPi8JFyRdwdHiaTH3nL7Hgz", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VZny7fs8eo78CZdGFT3EjqdogwZ4Pep3V"], "tags": ["landscape", "illustration", "tezos", "tz", "art", "hen", "landscapeillustration", "digitalart", "digitalillustration", "color", "dark", ""], "extra": {}}
