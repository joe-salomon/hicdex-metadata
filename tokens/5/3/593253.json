This was inspired by my little wombat/daughter who loves wrapping and adds flowers and stickytape to everything with a cheeky grin. \n[Note - My daughter decided that the Holly was needed herself and asked to be able to draw it in. I think you will agree she was spot on, so this painting is from both of us with love.]\n\nWishing you a very Merry Christmas or Happy Holiday and all the best for the year to come.\n\nSize - approximately 11cm square png, 300ppi\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSi7GpKmkisM5toXXdtiTWGUh9iutXXsWJikt6xdsbCxz", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQMZegtLVpKFS5VpW2uECcmKQo7Z62tx4egfZuh1sCzxo", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSi7GpKmkisM5toXXdtiTWGUh9iutXXsWJikt6xdsbCxz", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZmLCnKRm9ifqw97vWJwfRfV1jbypd8osJ"], "tags": ["objkt4xmas", "disabledartist", "christmas", "cute", "wombat", "happy", "disabledartistnft", "xmas", "happynewyear"], "extra": {}}
