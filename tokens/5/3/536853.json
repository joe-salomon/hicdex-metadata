She did not have many friends and although everyone had a lot of respect for her, her name was rarely mentioned. Her nickname was her name. She was in charge of administering the king's lands although no one knew how she got to that position. The king never had the consideration to visit her and the myth around her figure grew more and more as she also became a horrible figure. It was said that she was a witch, but she was a witch, although at night one could always have the feeling that she was walking around the town watching everything.  Some strange deaths of animals were attributed to her because no one dared to make it public, even though it was quite public.  \n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaHDG9qrLMup6FSRqpstY8eHXkqbGgGx8Knvc8XjF1xfb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVfqcXDve9bvCGDR4mruseTVbm25UMPoTzML3GRikrEsJ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaHDG9qrLMup6FSRqpstY8eHXkqbGgGx8Knvc8XjF1xfb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1P3gQUxrecWX9NtRASFgecCWchPQEiqa2b"], "tags": ["metaverse", "characters", "fiction", "microstories", "photography", "portraits", "facatack", "photographer", "digitalart", ""], "extra": {}}
