{"__version": 1, "token_id": 511653, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Foglie #3348", "description": "The Foglie series [1] consists of several pieces of generative art that display organic, leaf-like structures. The series uses the same core generating algorithm as the earlier t-SNE series [2] but renders the resulting point arrangements with filled polygons. Additionally, the color scales have been selected to produce warm, earth-like tones. Created on Oct. 13, 2021. Made in R using the {ggplot2} and {Rtsne} packages.\n\nSources:\n[1] https://clauswilke.com/art/project/foglie\n[2] https://clauswilke.com/art/project/t-sne\n\nAuthor:\nClaus O.
