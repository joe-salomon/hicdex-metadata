{"__version": 1, "token_id": 581053, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SOMEWHERE I CAN DISAPPEAR", "description": "Saying that I love the music from recording artist Beck, would be an understatement. On 'Hyperspace' his fourteenth studio album, there's a song that transports the mind, body, and soul and that song is \"Stratosphere\". There's a part of the chorus that is just absolute sonic perfection and the lyrics say, \"In the stratoshere, somewhere I can disappear\". During the recording of this album, Beck filed for divorce from Marissa Ribisi, and I feel that this song certainly can speak to a level of letting go or letting go of control of a certain aspect of your life. So, after listening to this incredible song, I decided to make an anagram of the poignant lyrics that made me stop in the first place and surprise, surprise the word pandemic was in there. I particularly like the somewhat cryptic, yet apropos wording of \"A PANDEMIC, WHERE I AS PROSE\". This work and the next work are actually a mini diptych within the main sequence. It's like having an artwork within an artwork.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmRpFCdHpN3VFmFHHqfu3uRkLd7y33DMbrZ7dz65q1gWNS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTaAtJ3NhewgXMhKpyNjo858WcibeAcZH8bY7TBH2P6Zd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmRpFCdHpN3VFmFHHqfu3uRkLd7y33DMbrZ7dz65q1gWNS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
