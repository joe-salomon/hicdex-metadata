Please Stand By, Running NYC For 50 Years, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the NYC Marathon. The 1st NYC Marathon was held on September 13th 1970 with only 127 competitors running multiple loops around Central Park to the cheering of approximately 100 spectators. Today the usual attendance rests around 55,000 runners making their way through the streets of all 5 boroughs of NYC as countless people cheers them through the streets the entire way; officially becoming the largest marathon in the world. This year brings with it an air of elevated importance and significance as it marks the return of the city after a global pandemic forced the marathon to be canceled in 2020. As the marathon itself helps to illustrate the resiliency of individuals, the event itself illustrates the resiliency of the entire city, proving that NOTHING can keep us down. I will myself be running it for the second time, and as a lifelong New Yorker it fills me with a sense of pride that I can help be a small part of showing the world that nothing can stop a New Yorker!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZ3YUpKNus26JdYakfrmTZw4FvkBzMfMB9apnamk5jH2Y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYstTP5R4hfAHCJVBxR2n3iHpJSLwsxBfs9HyzShWmNcD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZ3YUpKNus26JdYakfrmTZw4FvkBzMfMB9apnamk5jH2Y", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1VCtzuZHriPNays8UJnAdrZDgRaPehud2Y"], "tags": ["art", "digitalart", "glitch", "glitchart", "color", "colorpalette", "colorpalettes", "tv", "television", "NYCMARATHON"], "extra": {}}
