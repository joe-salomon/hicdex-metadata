It's like a blur in my mind. Cities come, cities go, So many people on the way, so many faces that I have forgotten how countries look like. But I have learned some things from my journey. It's that no matter where you go, people are the same. The love, the anger, the warmth of their hugs all feels the same, the rich the poor all the same, hunger the same, the sorrows, same...Yet you need an identity card to prove that you're a person. Yet there are borders between us. Physical, social, mental...different kinds of borders. So if you ever travel, remember to see in each man, woman, child, a reflection of yourself, maybe treat them the way you would treat your friends and family. And if anyone tells you anything different, ask them to travel...till the faces feel like a blur.\n\nThe Vagabond\n\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmXX2KSqvPnaGaqwmQRkumZ9bttVzSmoEDMG5vuqskzM2h", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXffxACgg831iYqS6257axvpmHifi6VpZJuDa48dQ9CVw", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmXX2KSqvPnaGaqwmQRkumZ9bttVzSmoEDMG5vuqskzM2h", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WpfD2hqPPhzHiH1zMz8fFaPcCLRakd77H"], "tags": ["photograph", "vagabond", "letter", "postcards", "version2", "blackandwhite"], "extra": {}}
