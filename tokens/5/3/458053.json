He is the conqueror that is never conquered and never harmed. This is because His strength, glory and power are overwhelming and cannot be overcome or resisted. He is the only one with complete mastery over all creation. The One who is the cherished source of all strength, power and potency.\n\nIt is He who forms you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. (Holy Quran 3:6)\n\nRather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. (Surah Nisa Quran 4:158)\n\nAnd to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. (Quran 48:7)\n\nIf you do not aid the Prophet \u2013 Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, \u201cDo not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.\u201d And Allah sent down his tranquillity upon him and supported him with angels you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah \u2013 that is the highest. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.
