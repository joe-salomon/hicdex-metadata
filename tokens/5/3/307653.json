On the days he'd trekk down the rocky road to the water, he would swing his hands and control it. The fog was easy to control; just a few swipes of his arms and it would fall away before him. They bowed to him wherever he went -- but only the fog, and only at the water. When he was home, he missed the power and security of being in control. Even the fog when the bath was too hot was tough to move. Lannon didn't mind, though, because he knew he would always have the water to come back to. Heck, who knows, maybe he'd become the captain of a ship one day!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPCVjYnHhjRD4CRapZUfgNBzx53d75ggeVyN4ELinKNsA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPhspy9WW1gqxB7smeDusp8bBHFYgZejYicHCt8Vf9FTQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPCVjYnHhjRD4CRapZUfgNBzx53d75ggeVyN4ELinKNsA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SFQD7VLwDVkiWBmyeR8PoyFaifRtaeKTa"], "tags": ["fog", "foggy", "lake", "bog", "photo", "photography", "nft", "landscape", "water", "cloudy", "clouds", "lily", "pad", "plants", "life", "growth", "sky", "green", "blue", "nature", "gloom", "darkness", "misty", "swamp", "story", "crypto", "hicetnunc", "nftart", "irl", "art", "everythingisconnected", "capacityvirus"], "extra": {}}
