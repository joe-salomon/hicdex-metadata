Elal was able to convince it that it was much better to live in the sea.\n\n\ud835\ude1b\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude0e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22 (@\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude22) \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 '\ud835\ude16\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude3a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude34' \ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude0a\ud835\ude0f\ud835\ude0c\ud835\ude15 \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude24\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmfNorPmhF1ov7HfkuMX6g6oXDxqUaoAAgRR3XWerbYWU8", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmdTxA5XugWGk3y3Wt3h1E2uZ69inGoo82DKV49WYuo8Hu", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmfNorPmhF1ov7HfkuMX6g6oXDxqUaoAAgRR3XWerbYWU8", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hnPqiBT7cBu8g886APwzMYc2nGctBomQD"], "tags": ["ourmyths", "chen", "argentina", "mythology", "whale"], "extra": {}}
