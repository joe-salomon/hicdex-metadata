I've been obsessed with toys and action figures FOREVER and out of all the toys I had as a kid my favorite were definitely TMNT. Even as an adult I've been collecting new versions of the Heroes In A Half-shell and todays layout features a personal photograph of a Super 7 Ultimates Michelangelo. These figures are brand new as of 2020 and could be some of the best Ninja Turtle figures ever produced.
