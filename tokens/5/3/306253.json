I slept with a premature lamb for a week once when her parents wouldn't take her, I remember vividly waking up every half an hour to stop her taking off, she was like a toy but much stronger. Another got paralysis from a tick and we had to give her shots of Vitamin C and put her in a little harness thing strung up under the porch so she could simulate standing movement to keep the digestion working. Up until it burned they would spend all their time up at this tree, up the hill from the house. You could go out in the morning and call \"Sheeeeep\", then hear the excited Baa's as they ran down the hill to get breakfast. Though they somehow survived the fire, they never went back up there. Then in the ensuing months they sadly passed, one by one. Survive a hellstorm, get taken out by the aftermath and hungry dogs. Nature is really something.\"\n\nPhotography by Jay Moon, during the Australian wildfires; November 2019.\n#11 of 15.\nAll funds generated go toward the ongoing recovery.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcckJMxMrPeMT3QmWrFgmUxJJzNKueUufA4BR7niLoerB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNZ4ttfjrFbVoS7FZCERbgnk8GyqvSTkDZaLRfXgk3kia", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcckJMxMrPeMT3QmWrFgmUxJJzNKueUufA4BR7niLoerB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2G2NzfXg5JDLcCQxGmToT8goBBGPwo1dtj"], "tags": ["photography", "fire", "australia", "wildfires", "natural"], "extra": {}}
