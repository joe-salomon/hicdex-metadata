{"__version": 1, "token_id": 354553, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Kerri - I Get Out", "description": "Kerri is a good friend that I was introduced to at a bar by another friend. So it should come as no surprise that our shoots all started with a pint of some sort of booze for her and a 12-pack of cheap beer for me:) The photos towards the end of each shoot would be pretty useless but screw it, they were a hell of a lot of fun to make. Because of our close proximity to each other and outside of photography friendship, Kerri wound up probably being the model I've shot most outside of Sylva Hattington, who there will definitely be photos of to come.\n\nAnyway, still my first day, 3rd NFT, and I'm still figuring it out but I have high hopes for what I'm seeing so far. I'm not very good at selling myself or doing work for other people so I've always struggled a bit financially. It's worth it to get to shoot what I want when I want. I'm hoping to finally find a home for my work where people appreciate it so please take a look at the rest of my creations and feel free to contact me at the links in my bio if you have any questions.\n\nPrice doubles after the first 10 of this series.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTrS5zmn5LMtEXdfzZSvfUKFCvZEjCMtCxTQTojkoSdGb", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmfYchPVTb4PZa1AKVm2FwPLivwroNfDYc2Wz1frXzZDae", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTrS5zmn5LMtEXdfzZSvfUKFCvZEjCMtCxTQTojkoSdGb", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["photo", "nsfw", "woman", "artnude", "moody", "sexy", "keithallenphillips", "shadows", "model", "blackandwhite", "photography", "nudeart", "erotica", "nude", "nft", "erotic", "nudity", "bnw", "inked", "tattoos", "alternative", "strongwoman", "badass"], "extra": {}}
