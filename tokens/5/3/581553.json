This funny character is a satire of their recent \"mic drop\" NFT announcement, in which they are trying to position themelves as if they are an artist having a 'genesis' collection, rather than a mutlinational corporation with an appalling track record of cultural and environmental damages and tremendous human cost. No PEPSICO. I do not welcome you to this space. If you were an politician or goverment, people would be ashamed to be photographed with you. So here is my MIC DROP. 100 editions ... will burn after 24 hours. This will be rare.
