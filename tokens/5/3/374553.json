Particles are advected by a fuel & smoke simulation while being affected by a separate fluid (grains) solver. The sparkles appear where the grains are more dense. The particles are also meshed to created a kind of fluid sack around the particles.\n\nTime: 10 seconds\nSize: 1280 x 1280 px\nFormat: MP4 without sound", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYHD8F4cGBmmWVsdqRuYFkFuQQxfVccukVr2nns1osr6V", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmTwaKJshLhNEuoQepqKaHfa1bJU8JTnpDfkRMWTWS1UDr", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYHD8F4cGBmmWVsdqRuYFkFuQQxfVccukVr2nns1osr6V", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz28wMDiPCM6rzUVLZi49QzkVtTyTWKc7gCm"], "tags": ["particles", "fluid", "sparkles", "3d", "cinema4d", "abstract", "simulation"], "extra": {}}
