Being a developing and aspiring digital artist, some of that challenge is removed for me, with the tools at my disposal, but maybe, just maybe, my colour challenges aren't challenges at all.\n\nWhen creating this piece, I thought back to the colour of moments in my life, where I interacted with artistic works, in hopes to construct a \"mind palette\" of sorts, and re-visualize those experiences and recall those memory more vividly - a process by which I\u2019m happy to get lost in.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmeENqmUM4ztNMnks1W4yiTgbdkNYiz5o9FitPr6bKDjrt", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmeENqmUM4ztNMnks1W4yiTgbdkNYiz5o9FitPr6bKDjrt", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"mimeType": "image/gif", "uri": "ipfs://QmeENqmUM4ztNMnks1W4yiTgbdkNYiz5o9FitPr6bKDjrt"}], "creators": ["tz1hMpzadgcgpUiDf5N6YXzMmDryWHKkaPuy"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
