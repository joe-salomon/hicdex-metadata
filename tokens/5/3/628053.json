I captured an interview with Dan in 2019, while shooting my documentary Artist and Toolmakers Past and Present (still in progress).\n\nThis is historical background from Dan's site:\nIn 1969, Dan Sandin joined the Art and Architecture faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to integrate computer and electronics into the art curriculum. He developed the Sandin analog image processer (IP) between 1969 and 1973. More than 20 copies of the IP were made, mostly by the artists who used them. Phil Morton made the first copy. The copying process created the full documentation of the IP that enabled other artists to \u201dcopy it right.\u201d The IP can be thought of as a video synthesizer patterned after the Moog model 2 audio synthesizer. In that role, it can be used to create and process video images as seen in Phil Morton\u2019s Colorful Colorado. The IP is, however, a general-purpose analog computer optimized for processing video signals used for control, as in Interactive Installations.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbwzT3ehXYaaBtXGGFCp7DG6JHwjNvkAPug58r8HUBRkM", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYGW95tRT6KT7zcYQ4cY8KEW4LFaVgQXPtxPXhLMyqva2", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbwzT3ehXYaaBtXGGFCp7DG6JHwjNvkAPug58r8HUBRkM", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1eYdZXuh9MvXPGq3DGuNPCZRpTMJz1DEYV"], "tags": ["IP", "Sandin", "CRT", "Analogcomputer", "analogvideo", "document", "toolmaking", "historic", "videoart", "mediaart", ""], "extra": {}}
