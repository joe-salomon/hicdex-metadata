It seems that not many people know that gunungan wayang is very meaningful.  Usually a mountain is equipped with several images that represent the universe.  The mountains in the shadow puppets are cone-shaped (tapered to the top) symbolizing human life.  The higher the knowledge and the older the age, humans must be more conical (golong gilig) to merge soul, taste, creation, intention, and work in our lives (closer to the Creator).\n\nThe gate and the two guards at Gunungan Wayang Kulit (Cingkoro Bolo and Bolo Upoto), a symbol of the good and bad human heart.  The shield and godho held by the giant are translated as guardians of nature and light.\n\nThe big tree that grows throughout the body and the top of the mountain symbolizes all cultivation and human behavior that must grow and move forward (dynamically) so that it is useful and colors the world and the universe.  In addition, the large tree on the mountain also symbolizes that God provides shelter and protection for humans who live in this world.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZr3K5w2PMPchTsZySKWAbXqCTMeSyMy7W2DZkgAUwCvJ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbdkZemmLGiDD3J4cDdVXKjE3cTPAHSi3E1iqokgk43ug", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZr3K5w2PMPchTsZySKWAbXqCTMeSyMy7W2DZkgAUwCvJ", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2AeTUd5BNaxTA9UA2q8cLFrtsLeNL7Kbra"], "tags": ["Photography", "culture", "java"], "extra": {}}
