Can he feel my tears?\nCan he sense my breaking heart?\nGod only knows such a fact.\nHow can this be that he can't see me?\nIs it because I'm sitting alone in the darkness?\nI just walk past everyone as if I were invisible.\nCan he see me now? Can he see the pain he's caused me?\nOr does he look past it? I think I should move on,\nBut something tells me to wait.\nIt's my heart. I'll give him one more chance\nHe needs to prove his love to me.\nAs I return to sit alone in the darkness...\nWaiting.\n\ndigital painting\n3508 x 3554 px\n\nPersonal use only.
