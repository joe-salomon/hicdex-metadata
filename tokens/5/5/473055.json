Moreover, I do not have any intention to lead the observer to any direction. The only joy I get from finishing a piece is the effect on the observers, the effect that takes them from the present time and throws them to Lethe of past memories. So it is up to you to start a journey. \nBtw, on the technical wise, I generally try to give the old school look, like it was on an old T-shirt. I take my hand drawings to the Photoshop and try to use minimal effect, just inking on the drawing and simple paint. Hope you like the vacation!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTsSy1PpD8FtLJdGJ1BB7CfCBFmZmXHceyvuhCUzanueV", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qme9GktQViEpEt9SR8WstbXodKHXLGbL338aqLJL9tCXQn", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTsSy1PpD8FtLJdGJ1BB7CfCBFmZmXHceyvuhCUzanueV", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1biW6HojhsPdu3mftCxUoZNoMtnFjTqbsR"], "tags": ["illustration", "nft", "inktober", "surreal", "drawing", "handmade", "tshirt", "tattoo", ""], "extra": {}}
