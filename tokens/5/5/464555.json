I channeled Usher a little bit. I have BIG dreams for this music video.\n\nA song from my pandemic inspired lyrical project, Queer Core: Behind the Music\n\nWho doens't like a cocky ass song written after the fact . . . Naked Truths lay with you.\n\nHere is the NFT for purchase.\n\nEnjoy a song about lies and cheating. It needed to be 2020 for me to get the harmonies to do this like I would have done it around the firepit with my homies. Talking s**t! It takes a village to do R&B harmonies!\n\n\nlyrics\nDamn\nNaked Truths\nLay with you\n\nAll these trips\nOut of town\nWhat\u2019s really good\nYou duckin\u2019 dodging me\nI\u2019m holding down the fort\nDreaming of\nHarvests and progeny\nYou loggin miles in your black book\nPassport stamps\nThere\u2019s words for women like you\nI\u2019d never call you a . . .\nDamn\nPosting pictures of a smile\nThat we had to pose to take\nYou block my calls\nSo folks can like\nWhat they see\nThey pictures that we take\nWhen I\u2019m out of town\nIn silence\nAnd I drop you off at Reagen\nThe queen of checkin in\nShe ain\u2019t posting any mentions\nWhere were you?\n\nDon't want no talk\nTake our clothes off\nNaked truths lay with you\n(Tell me the truth\nOr I don\u2019t want to talk to you)\nNaked truths lay with you\n\nI hear you talking to me babe\nYour story \u2018s running in and out of places\nYou ain\u2019t supposed to be\nSo why you lie to me\nI\u2019m not running from you babe\nI\u2019m going to my happy place\nThis dungeon ain\u2019t for me\nSo call me when it\u2019s clean\nAnd the beast leaves\n\nDon't want no talk\nTake our clothes off\nNaked truths lay with you\n\ncredits\nfrom Queer Core: Behind the Music, released November 27, 2020\nAll instruments by QueenEarth unless otherwise noted\nBass and Vocals by QueenEarth\nMixed and recorded by QueenEarth in Baltimore, MD\nWritten and composed by M Smith\nExecutive Produced by QueenEarth\nMix and Mastered by QueenEarth\n\n\nNFT owner has the right to resell the music and art NFT,\n\nto publicly perform and publicly display the art.\n\nOwner may not reproduce, prepare derivatives, or distribute copies,\n\nwithout the consent of and credit to the original creator.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbjPiAUw6q54NLP1g2tdK4Jgmzm6BDChQG4UzNoD876uX", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXejRTQJHMnUHkpiXTtJxjzxX7GfBVChhtoXe1LHRoEMh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbjPiAUw6q54NLP1g2tdK4Jgmzm6BDChQG4UzNoD876uX", "mimeType": "audio/wav"}], "creators": ["tz1WTgQEb7x15MNZxouF9H9r2Qdbux7bJ7XG"], "tags": ["nakedtruths", "queenearth", "rnb", "R&B", "rhythmandblues", "neo-soul", "soul", "blackmusic", "blacknftart"], "extra": {}}
