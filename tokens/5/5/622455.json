{"__version": 1, "token_id": 622455, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Chansey - Base Set Shadowless 1st Edition (Pokemon Card)", "description": "Chansey is a pink, ovoid Pok\u00e9mon with stubby arms and dark pink feet. It has tiny eyes and three hair-like growths on each side of its head. The tufts of hair have dark pink tips. On the center of its belly is a dark pink pouch that contains a single white egg. The egg is said to be very nutritious and it lays several new ones every day. Finally, it has a short tail. Chansey is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\n\nA kindhearted Pok\u00e9mon, Chansey will share its eggs with injured people and Pok\u00e9mon. This is the basis for its signature move, Soft-Boiled. The eggs become more delicious if Chansey is raised with love and care. Chansey's egg is used as a high-class cooking ingredient due to the nutrition it has. Due to its egg being over-harvested, Chansey is extremely rare in the wild and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it. Fleeing from those seeking its egg has made this once-slow species much quicker on its feet than in the past. It is more commonly found in urban settings. Chansey is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Lucky Punch item.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUHDAfocQvxpvBfTW8iH2xuS2nNXJ1U9bzMv2427A6KwF", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUHDAfocQvxpvBfTW8iH2xuS2nNXJ1U9bzMv2427A6KwF", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUHDAfocQvxpvBfTW8iH2xuS2nNXJ1U9bzMv2427A6KwF", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1d6RYi1pb9Gkeu8PdUJmw6yd77qMNjF7Lo"], "tags": ["vfx", "card", "animated", "cards", "egg", "love", "pokemon", "blastoise"], "extra": {}}
