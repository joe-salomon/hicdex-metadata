In a word, any leisure activities you could think of in the real world can be found in Crypto Garden. Above all, you could make friends with mystery native residents here.\n\nTal Rasha's Tree is the first Christmas Tree from Crypto Garden. This is the limited edition with ONLY 1,000 pieces globally. This is your pass to the Crypto Garden Metaverse, your gateway island. Once you plant this tree in the Garden, you would be able to witness the growth of the tree. Because this is the limited edition, the tree will grow lots of gifts as surprises!\n\nThis project was incubated by MCLAB (mclab.world). MCLAB is the go-to metaverse-ready design house.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZMitUGDKy7ySqBKDQVBnAapSL29dd1xZ299ZnBYJrHub", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmVgrk64ZnH7cPvotkNnU8ZYuGjXTkpUbMvJMVuKSseZvQ", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZMitUGDKy7ySqBKDQVBnAapSL29dd1xZ299ZnBYJrHub", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1hGisWwgs8Ne9VDrRbvYfHYphwHrwfMdSp"], "tags": [""], "extra": {}}
