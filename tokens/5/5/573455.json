Some days you're lucky to control it, and other days the demon controls you. Unlike your pet dog who eats dog food, this demon feeds on lust and longing. It wants to destroy everything good - all the things you love about yourself, your relationships and your life. It gets in the way of any progress you try to make with yourself or others, but yet it sometimes shows signs that it cares or supports you (tempting you) hoping that this will be the time that serves as a starting point for your devolution into its domain. And when we get too comfortable with these supportive moments, when we let down our guard and let the demon in so very deeply, before long we're overtaken by him/her/it completely.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7ui2HdDDkUemvni5VQk1prGtZ5Kp9YxUKJ7sDkntSmN", "display_uri": "ipfs://Qmf7ui2HdDDkUemvni5VQk1prGtZ5Kp9YxUKJ7sDkntSmN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmf7ui2HdDDkUemvni5VQk1prGtZ5Kp9YxUKJ7sDkntSmN", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1Zf6FqxBMKQVivXaW2t9KGxtt6UUaf3a6F"], "tags": ["IllustrationAbstractDemons"], "extra": {}}
