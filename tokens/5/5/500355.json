I picked the tired being up and admired his beautiful form before putting him back where he belongs -in nature. It was a nice moment, caring for something so small. I thought about how all life matters in a moment of not feeling much worth myself. \"How ironic I thought\", concluding that my life must matter too.\n\nKeep this piece for as long as you need a reminder that you matter. Pass it on to someone who needs it once the beetle has served its purpose.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYNP3bMfrWPnqUkSA4F4whaWvfQ5VVS1rHWyUwHyes22y", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQDcm8KeBYQjG9oj9zgde4667sTz5Zn1gbj6fcN3nnTfL", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYNP3bMfrWPnqUkSA4F4whaWvfQ5VVS1rHWyUwHyes22y", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1em6mGWbZK7T5zJk7CLKqGRgyBD8oCF4tr"], "tags": ["hen500k", "digitalart", "mentalhealth", "hope", "affirmation", "art", "cheap", "painting"], "extra": {}}
