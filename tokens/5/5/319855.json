We put up this barrier to keep people from crossing into something that we don\u2019t want them to know, and when they cross the line, we lash out. We all wear masks at one time or another, some more than others do. We wear the masks to cover up the true us, and what we are really feeling. Wearing a mask protects us from vulnerability. Inside we want to tell people what is going on in our lives, but we fear rejection and we fear that someone will make fun of us for what we believe and how we feel.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaZqt5yekpMMZnCgp31FR8V4BLKpWbFcaafxvCxUkQrf4", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmRAf9uEFSwxkYoKsNcEVWBn4QaHvjj9s7Bb3vci33cjFT", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaZqt5yekpMMZnCgp31FR8V4BLKpWbFcaafxvCxUkQrf4", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1WRP8Py94HxUnor8iRYS3xnTwLnd1vjjd2"], "tags": ["Mask", "Illustration", "DigitalDrawing", "Artwork", "NFT", "Collector", "Tezos", "Model", "Woman", "Painting", "Art", ""], "extra": {}}
