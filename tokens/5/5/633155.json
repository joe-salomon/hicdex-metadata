It\u2019s about grieving something you had. The complexity of dealing with something or someone you have to miss. \nEvery illustration in this collection has its own identity. The colour combinations say something about the person portrayed: who they are and how they feel. And through the way they make eye contact or look away, these individuals tell their story.\n\nArtwork made by Bo Stiemer.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmW6XgHsArLTh15g1oBMF4jt7VAeebxKeNaZkm3AAY7Jwh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmW6XgHsArLTh15g1oBMF4jt7VAeebxKeNaZkm3AAY7Jwh", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmW6XgHsArLTh15g1oBMF4jt7VAeebxKeNaZkm3AAY7Jwh", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1h6pj2rTZhJy3QXigvPjZWxFjSe5Wsdcr7"], "tags": ["digital", "artwork", "illustration", "portrait", "story", "collection", "identity", "personality", "artist", "colours", "feelings", "loss", "grief"], "extra": {}}
