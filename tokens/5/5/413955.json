Each of the 3 versions is an edition of 5 and collectors of all 3 versions receive a 1/1 airdrop.\n\nThe work breaks down what NFTs are made of in 2021 and what conditions brought them about. Maybe its fully code-based formula can even outlast some of its constituent technologies and help dream them anew.\n\nBehind an encoded poem and it\u2019s 80\u2019s inspired robot face, you can discover digital art for yourself. The modifiable nature of the 11x11 grid allows you to make your own artwork and change it or redo it whenever you want. The work is created responsively for display its shown on, so it\u2019ll always look crisp regardless of scale.\n\nUse this artwork to onboard no-coiners to world of punks & frens.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThis artwork is dedicated to the NFT patron Cozomo de\u2019 Medici (a.k.a.
