It is the same as it was yesterday and as it will remain tomorrow. He is ever constant, firm, and loyal.\n\nIndeed, it is Allah who is the [continual] Provider, the firm possessor of strength. (Quran 51:58)\n\nThe thunder glorifies His praises, as do the angels in awe of Him. He sends thunderbolts, striking with them whoever He wills. Yet they dispute about Allah. And He is tremendous in might. (Quran 13:13)\n\nBut you will never find in the way of Allah any change, and you will never find in the way of Allah any alteration.
