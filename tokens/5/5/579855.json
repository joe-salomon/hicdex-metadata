They manifest energetic shocks, spatial translations, explosions of color and packets of information that happen in my psyche during transcendent processes.\nDeep look externalizes the wave sensation that occurs in consciousness during decision making, the pendulum movement between various options that are progressively illuminated by the imagination.\nIt was made in Processing and exported with movie maker in MP4 format.\n\nThe code used is a fork of Landscape by Henrik Linusson, included in his manual of examples for Processing.
