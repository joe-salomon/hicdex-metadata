{"__version": 1, "token_id": 317655, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "TezTools Node Service \u2013 Shared Node Wave 1", "description": "Getting access to your wallet or to some dapps in the Tezos ecosystem can be hampered by an over-used public network of nodes. When a popular NFT series or application drops and causes issues for the Tezos network its not usually the chain that has a problem at all. The bottleneck is the computer systems used to access the blockchain\u2026the nodes. \n\nNodes serve two critical jobs beyond the core job of baking blocks (in baking nodes), nodes provide the data you see such as your wallet balance, NFT\u2019s owned or a list of recently sold tokens. Nodes are also the way transactions are submitted to the network\u2019s mempool. To secure the network the nodes that provide data and transaction access are sperate from the nodes that bake new blocks. This circumstance is part of why when the network gets busy the chain ticks on flawlessly while it seems like no one can complete a transaction. \n\nA TezTools shared node helps make the chain more usable by giving those with accounts a way to access chain data and the mempool through nodes that are balanced to ensure plenty of computing capacity per user of the system. We won\u2019t allow more users than a node can handle at speed and won\u2019t sign up new users until we have more nodes to accommodate them. \n\nWhile not as secure as a private node, this affordable option is great for the user who is frustrated with public nodes getting clogged during peak periods or is looking for more consistent access to the Tezos network. You can use your shared node account with any compatible wallet or API including the Tezos CLI for all your basic automation needs (rate limiting may apply). \n\nTicket can be redeemed for 12-months of shared node service in the region of your choice (based on region availability). \n\nUpon redemption, purchasers will receive an exclusive NFT commissioned by TezTools from @YinYangYoeshi. Only users of TezTools Wave 1 node service will have an opportunity to own this NFT (secondary sales proceeds for NFT go to @YinYangYoeshi).\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmTpwvJG2ER4JqzUGwDwQdwTZX5Knwnz21FRxwjtDFJjpn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmUpicg58hodYRkdACKU8nwSwF41uJM2Yjk1RE169tNFCH", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmTpwvJG2ER4JqzUGwDwQdwTZX5Knwnz21FRxwjtDFJjpn", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1cCZgcViuFJcNQbefgvDaP2139uKc9ohTB"], "tags": ["teztools", "tezos", "node", "tezosnode", "shared"], "extra": {}}
