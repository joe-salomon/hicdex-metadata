{"__version": 1, "token_id": 633455, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "INSURRECTION", "description": "When I think back to the disgraceful events of January 6th, 2021, one word stands out amongst thousands; insurrection. Upon thorough cogitation on this specific word, I began to see a narrative within the word itself. It began with discovering ananagram of INSURRECTION; IRONIC UNREST. And within IRONIC UNREST, the words ON RECRUITS, IN became available to me. From these three lines of anagrams of each other we are given the narrative of ON RECRUITS, IN (as if they're marching orders from an overlord) IRONIC UNREST (ironic in the sense that the MAGA insurrectionists/seditionists thought they were taking back the country as if it were 1776 from the British, but reality will show them squarely and clearly on the wrong side of history.) There is so much fear, hate, rage in Cult 45, that it clouds their judgement on right and wrong. What is hilariously hypocritical of the MAGA Republicans is that they claim to be so 'Pro-Life' with their views on abortion and love for Police/Law Enforcement...and yet...so free with malice and mayhem against police officers on Capitol Hill that day and the use of extreme violence. The story writes itself, I'm just a voyeur to vicious and violent, vindictive vigilante vandalism.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaVXVYoz4CXyPwJE1pBuu6psDnyCEDU8dDYBLHcEAhK3D", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPQtjxkEame9zhUP86XSzFRDP5ftZKttWaagnsa55re3m", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaVXVYoz4CXyPwJE1pBuu6psDnyCEDU8dDYBLHcEAhK3D", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
