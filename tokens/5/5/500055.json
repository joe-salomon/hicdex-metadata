Artifacts created by sculpting them with my mandala algorithm. \n\nThis series of works is directly inspired by shrines, temples, and other structures of ancient SE Asia. The algorithm first creates a foundational grid pattern based on proportionality rules of mandala. This grid is then extruded recursively in 3D space. Its surface then modulated along an infinite geometric curve to manually give it shape thus granting some artistic control of its final form.\n\nBy @zenaranya.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmPM67gES8XiXfQStpG67kLcoKZEynzMUL2YZWHCnkFC4g", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXX1eqKaHbgWXbkQSPG8mtfUxxRXTTj2u5Le1tn5nSZTB", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmPM67gES8XiXfQStpG67kLcoKZEynzMUL2YZWHCnkFC4g", "mimeType": "model/gltf-binary"}], "creators": ["tz1U72EG4beo6ZztyheWMQ4tKR2EqjPYTBoq"], "tags": ["generative", "mandala", "pottery", "vase", "hydra", "hen500k"], "extra": {}}
