{"__version": 1, "token_id": 324655, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Sacred Geometry", "description": "Sacred geometry ascribes symbolic and sacred meanings to certain geometric shapes and certain geometric proportions. It is associated with the belief that a god is the geometer of the world. The geometry used in the design and construction of religious structures such as churches, temples, mosques, religious monuments, altars, and tabernacles has sometimes been considered sacred. The concept applies also to sacred spaces such as temenoi, sacred groves, village greens, pagodas and holy wells, and the creation of religious art.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcEYexV25nuBSTTKWLkcLtn2KeapG1aqpUzy2ri7NA6s3", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmP3Bo8K9RDjdxQdxUXp8Dj27sy6U7y5HDoXQBTfZX8xGD", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcEYexV25nuBSTTKWLkcLtn2KeapG1aqpUzy2ri7NA6s3", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1g7wtAtGgwA68PS3VTeKm2mELk5efosM72"], "tags": ["meditation", "sacredgeo", "geometry", "energyart", "energy"], "extra": {}}
