There was a tiny house whose pillars and walls were covered by various kinds of grass and tree branches forming an entrance. You will find plants that when the flowers are blown form an instrument of soothing notes. Near the end of the slope, there is a tree-like maple that has a crescent-shaped fruit if you squeeze the fruit it eats a sweet syrup and at night the fruit glows. Across the river lies the bridge to the cosmic gate where you will only find a show of exploding stars.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmT5LB3FYeUgMjRoaoZp8265q1k9Urn9e2HUQ3AJWr5uY7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmS1NVwx5vnxu2fVjE6LhWmkZuckUYWen9jojabmL6pYfM", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmT5LB3FYeUgMjRoaoZp8265q1k9Urn9e2HUQ3AJWr5uY7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1gdRN1XcDeEpsP8KHDy9nc8c1JPBvCerde"], "tags": ["cosmic", "utopia", "imaginary", "vivid", "colorful", ""], "extra": {}}
