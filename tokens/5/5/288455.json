He also fought against many apostates and enemies of Zartosht to do so. In return, Zartosht gave Esfandiy\u0101r a chain and armor from Heaven. The armor made him invincible and the chain had the power to bind anyone, even a demon or evil magician, making them unable to escape. Zartosht also gave a Divine blessing to the prince and declared that anyone who would spill the blood of Esfandiy\u0101r (killed him) shall suffer a cursed life of bad omens until the day he dies and even after death would be condemned to hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n The Shahnameh (\u201cBook of Kings\u201d, composed 977-1010 CE) is a medieval epic written by the poet Abolqasem Ferdowsi (l. c. 940-1020 CE) in order to preserve the myths, legends, history, language, and culture of ancient Persia. It is the longest work by a single author in world literature at a length of 50,000 rhymed couplets, 62 stories, and 990 chapters.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://bafybeiabvqrgcfceytizg4ukprdes3lsxmoqsiul7kc5tvsssv5aj5ynri", "display_uri": "ipfs://bafkreici7t5gsimgjkcfl6ivzuyaoiudrjf2fuh7qpinigef4oo5t4idx4", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://bafybeiabvqrgcfceytizg4ukprdes3lsxmoqsiul7kc5tvsssv5aj5ynri", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SA8HrrqB168iK9cfUu2RGvPUCoow2DEwG"], "tags": ["Esfandyar", "death", "blood", "persian", "persianart", "persian", "ferdowsi", "white", "nft", "nftcommunity", "conceptart", "2d", "art", "character", "collection"], "extra": {}}
