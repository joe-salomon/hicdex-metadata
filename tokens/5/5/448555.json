They are also used to protect individuals from harm, dangerous beings, or unseen evil influences.\n\nEach demon is original and unique (like our inner struggles) and there are no two demons that are exactly the same in the collection. Unlike our inner demons, these images are meant to be carried, displayed and shared as a reminder that you have the power to overcome your personal demons no matter how many or how frightening they might be.\n\nThe poet Charles Bukowski put it this way:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fight your demons. Your demons are here to teach you lessons. Sit down with your demons and have a drink and a chat and learn their names and talk about the burns on their fingers and scratches on their ankles. Some of them are very nice.\u201d\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZRPRWKTN1TKVd4uoG5svveBrJdAZDuaxmAmAGXjWNfLh", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYUjK4PnbESucPDDP43eQqRjkv7VQ4MHeRiZyzLLDhQhd", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZRPRWKTN1TKVd4uoG5svveBrJdAZDuaxmAmAGXjWNfLh", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1M9TgQbP8oNWaV45X6aBznmMTRHv5HdB7b"], "tags": ["GuardianDemons", "KnotworkIndustries", "JohnDilworth", "Demons", "Art", "Collectible"], "extra": {}}
