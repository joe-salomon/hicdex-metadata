{"__version": 1, "token_id": 583655, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "SAMO", "description": "SAMO is a graffiti tag originally used on the streets of New York City from 1978 to 1980. The tag, written with a copyright symbol as \"SAMO\u00a9\", and pronounced Same-Oh is primarily associated with the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, but was developed as a collaboration between Basquiat and Al Diaz.\n\nThe SAMO tag accompanied short phrases, which were poetic and satirical advertising slogans, mainly spray painted on the streets of downtown Manhattan. Basquiat eventually used the tag himself, creating some non-graffiti work on paper and canvas using that tag, just before and after killing off the SAMO graffiti by painting \"SAMO\u00a9 IS DEAD\" around the streets of downtown. Decades later, Diaz resurrected the SAMO tag", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmUmhv1M4rupSyCGEpRuyn3GNLQXeJDmMAnbnpZn75Ne91", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYYJw5pK8tJEr1zjshfmP8y3Wz9BEXTSSvsKLjRn62ub5", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmZ882KhEY2A6nhofN9b5iwhQif4D3b5sruKLcvA67yzoH", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmUmhv1M4rupSyCGEpRuyn3GNLQXeJDmMAnbnpZn75Ne91", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dc3WD752ofpfo5zgomtx4pEpsVP6i1cZx"], "tags": ["digitalart", "aculgaos", "doodle", "drawing", "2d", "ink", "illustration", "character"], "extra": {}}
