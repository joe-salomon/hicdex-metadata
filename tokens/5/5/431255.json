To me, Phish is not just great music to listen to but it\u2019s also an experience that causes me to connect with something beyond myself that is a feeling of life as it is meant to be. \n\nThis is a digital painting made in procreate and inspired by the line \u201cAnd the night seems to go on incredibly long\u201d from the song, Theme From the Bottom by Phish. On one hand it\u2019s a literal interpretation of a long night but it also suggests our ability to experience an expanded consciousness of our place in the universe. \n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmdUpVfXt3uDodYdc76fLA5hKPPuEUnghohUEKosFTxFvg", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmQo9DMJepLRVWt9err1GgYHst4a7V4uJTdzjQpvA8pUjN", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmdUpVfXt3uDodYdc76fLA5hKPPuEUnghohUEKosFTxFvg", "mimeType": "image/png"}], "creators": ["tz1ZceWgjPx5fKXFhbetvsiqHmMBQTcZ3Jzt"], "tags": ["Phish", "Perspective", "Procreate", "Painting", "Universe", "Digital", "Reality", "Consciousness", "Wonder", "Stars", "Planets"], "extra": {}}
