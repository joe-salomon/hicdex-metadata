They floated on our oceans and graced both the water's surface as well as its mysterious depths.\n\nWith most of their bodies under water, they were continually sculpted by the winds and the seas. Nature provided us with an infinite number of variations and a plethora of mythical properties to our ever evolving ecosystem.\n\nGathering the remnants of tales passed down from generations and what we now believe to be facts, each of these artistic representations focuses on one of the many traits of these ancient ice giants.\n\n\u263c \u219b \\\u21db\n\nJPG\n7441 x 10984 px\n61 x 91cm (+1cm bleed)\n\nFranck Aubry 2021\n\ud83d\udc26 @franckaubry", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZvBsuyQEZ5BZLZkx2Ytw2qNPdN2jdHyUutpxeX7urtxG", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNd5ZHHqgbFUvL5Kk2FFvKj7zzfwr1HXwJgiok2Eiv34v", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZvBsuyQEZ5BZLZkx2Ytw2qNPdN2jdHyUutpxeX7urtxG", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WEj3qaaTyXiVZanFBAkQQB7DVi9KcWCfc"], "tags": ["2D", "@franckaubry", "CreativeCoding", "FHAS", "FranckAubry", "Genartclub", "IcebergStudies", "Illustration"], "extra": {}}
