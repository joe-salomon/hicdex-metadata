It was spring, yet it was winter. She had a translucent skin, yet she wasn\u2019t translucent hiding her thoughts behind the iron-strong armour.\n\nA flash you wear is not who you are. We are all God\u2019s creatures, and we are here for a purpose, my little friend.\n\n\u201cBut you changed everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\nWe were just boys, we were young and stupid, and we were bad, and did disgusting things. We were unpretty. Now I have only one eye, and my burden in a closet. \n\nWhy have I done it?\n\nI don\u2019t remember. Every qubit of my memories was burned, parts of it never merged in the same structures like it had been before.\n\nI was riding on a freight from a bad place to a place that even worth, from bad behavior to dirt, out of any reasonable orbit. That\u2019s what I still do, suffering every single second; just drifting in space, twirling, and torching, out of control, a homeless cat in a dark metal box, watching the stars.\n\n\u201cIsabella,\u201d it whispers in my ear.\n\nYour name is on a tip of my tongue still. Isabella. I still remember your warm breath, a musk smell of your neck. \n\nWhat have I done, mother? I don\u2019t remember it, mother.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZw7j46DZs2Vof7ud34EJfG5pz2eVQjuPbz2yXhHBPbM9", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmZw7j46DZs2Vof7ud34EJfG5pz2eVQjuPbz2yXhHBPbM9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZw7j46DZs2Vof7ud34EJfG5pz2eVQjuPbz2yXhHBPbM9", "mimeType": "image/gif"}], "creators": ["tz1boBFSnCFKEZ4HynCdmDiiNJAvJj5iH7e5"], "tags": ["cryptoliterature", "literature", "fiction", "scifi", "abstract", "transhumanism", "bayfragile", "anemonesdiaries"], "extra": {}}
