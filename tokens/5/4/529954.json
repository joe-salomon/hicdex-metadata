The gummy bears reminded me of the sky-blue Jolly Rancher I used to pick from the rest of the brunch because my favorite color was blue, and it wasn't as sour as the green one. However, the surface of the gummy bear wasn't firm but smooth like a gusher, the ones Betty Crocker made. Soft and gushy, yet without the gush. Later, I realized eating more gummy bears would take me to Jolly Paradise. I held one gummy bear up to the light to see the transparent optical effect you would see when staring at water wimples in a small pond when the sun refracts light causing small sections of the water to light up like Christmas. I figured dipping gummy bears in the pool of liquor then holding it up to a light source caused the light to be refracted into maybe a rainbow. It did. A beam of white light flowing through a gummy bear doused in vodka made a pretty spectrum of colors. Gummy bears are magic! They have the ability to break down pure light into a palette of colors.\n\n'Jolly Paradise Collection.' \n\nRarity: Diamond Infinity \n\nCollectors who own this interactive NFT have successfully collected 3/3 of the 'Jolly Paradise Collection' Congratulations and enjoy an augmented or virtual reality experience.
