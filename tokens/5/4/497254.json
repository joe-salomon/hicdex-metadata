(I've been here before!) (I've already been here!) the memories returned ... That was me, but I was not just me: there was no mask, nothing to hide or hide. our wound was the same, our mask was the same! as well as our light, our love and together with the heat, we find ourselves being one, not only among ourselves but with each cell and manifestation of life. Being a single heart beating in the matrix of earth. and we remember: I was already here sister! and I was here with you !! I love you sister!! we were born !!!", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYtNFfREGwSBLcBUrudDvP4jNd3NAzct5e7cDtaz4EVu1", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcwPdAhHVWKfJHQNLomPi8D8rziPmvfQwd9T9pZneWYac", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYtNFfREGwSBLcBUrudDvP4jNd3NAzct5e7cDtaz4EVu1", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1hjnQnXcnE9ak35KJ97HTygjwjafjyCb9c"], "tags": ["Spiritual", "trippy", "collage", "animation", "photograpy", "woman", "psychedellic"], "extra": {}}
