Every week they would go there and every single time the girl would space out whenever she saw the glittering light and that big Ferris Wheel that had people on it. Before she knew it, her dad would carry her on his back, tuck her into bed, a kiss on the forehead, thus she slept with a smile on her face.\n\nNow that when she is much older, the memories linger. Whenever she saw the ferris wheel, she would remember the days at the carnival, every single one of it. However, the ones that she truly long for is when her parents would tuck her into bed and kiss her forehead thus she could sleep well with a smile on her face.\n\n\u2014\n\nTaken in Jakarta (January 9th, 2022)\nNarration by @franskumaras", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmSajNYmiuaWnc1yghNcRmrmxAKwtuChcYB2Sq4BTTgbu7", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbwJzWCpsJpmKqYgAfPiQpnPW6s9B4gPUrFJFjk8FYBKs", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmSajNYmiuaWnc1yghNcRmrmxAKwtuChcYB2Sq4BTTgbu7", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz2VFA2jFwEJdazpADvpy25Qv1xSWQ4jNFuW"], "tags": ["blackandwhite", "photography", "bydianefurry", "memories", "ferriswheel", "minimalistic"], "extra": {}}
