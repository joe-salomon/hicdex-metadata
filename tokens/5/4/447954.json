I consumed quite a few cannabis edibles and mind's eye began to see total darkness. I was not afraid as I stared intently into the void of nothingness. I floated in the vastness of emptiness and the only thing that existed was my stare. My ego was not present, as I was just an observer of darkness. Typically you hear stories of people being in dark spaces getting creeped out or scared out of their minds. It almost felt like the darkness was disappointed that I wasn't scared. Not sure how to qualify or quantify this statement/feeling. It was almost as if I stared into the darkness and the darkness got creeped out by me. That makes total sense to me. Anyone else surprised by that?", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmcFFP2cKGYGZekhCTRAPsuH6xSYJVaMh4sUn94tCt24hB", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmXh7o3fwMXGUU52XXQT4TsUM9UHxW8mYCxRnap42UXHrU", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmcFFP2cKGYGZekhCTRAPsuH6xSYJVaMh4sUn94tCt24hB", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1VvvB43pvwD5FMvsYzkYYMTvxBbLkp7NdZ"], "tags": ["digitalart", "poetry", "conceptualart", "art", "nftart", "concretepoetry", "digital", "nft", "text", "visualpoem", "poem", "nftartist", "visualart", "visualartist"], "extra": {}}
