Yes, why beans indeed. \nBecause a bean is more than it seems, for three reasons:\n\n1. Beans are small. \nBeans are measured in units of insignificance. A bean is like a penny you see on the sidewalk, but you are on your way to the dentist and anyway, you are not a little kid anymore, so you don't bother to pick it up. Bending over just isn't worth it: Beans don't make you work.\n\n2. Beans are magic. \nMind the beanstalk, growing right up into the clouds while you are asleep, unwitting. But these are not your common everyday clouds, not the ones you see from your airplane window, no; these clouds contain magical kingdoms. Kingdoms accessible only by beans.\n\n3. Beans are dangerous. \nThey can make you fart, turning you into an anti-social, abject being no one wants to hang out with. It's because of the carbs, they say, bean carbs you can't even digest, so once again you don't work, but delegate the task to devious little worker bacteria in your large intestine. They repay you in putrid gasses. Is this the formation of class consciousness? \n\nIt's beans.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmYBqTY5dLaaqmyKoQ2X6J3iQ8BQQwJ6fy5ZgoyQYS1x32", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmY3KbqgA4Uu766JK1eK1nUpbsikLRjfbDcjUGRVnju53B", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmYBqTY5dLaaqmyKoQ2X6J3iQ8BQQwJ6fy5ZgoyQYS1x32", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1dozA4bwYBnh3tfNWWbeC3hkAmTeuKXb6f"], "tags": ["economictheory", "readymades", "abjkts", "photography"], "extra": {}}
