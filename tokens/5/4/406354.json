She was coming out from the East Coast to visit another photographer I knew. She seemed like a fairly awesome person in the conversations we had so I was totally down to shoot with her. In my bio on this modeling site I had some crack about how I wouldn't shoot just anyone BUT, I was easily bribed with cheap beer and Reese's peanut butter cups. Well, my friend brought her over to the studio and she walks in with TWO cases of beer. One for me and one for her. And a king sized pack of peanut butter cups. We shot until we had drank too many beers to make useable pictures and then just partied all night.. because why not? Young and dumb in LA. Those were the days:)", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmbZHkKuVDNZKweNSidi36cttbee1enjimDQ76KoNYpHfW", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYEw9sCHpYTdiY5R8pPBUfRf6ehJBXjyoXcexme7W1cLm", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmbZHkKuVDNZKweNSidi36cttbee1enjimDQ76KoNYpHfW", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1TtReAn9vPCaQSACP5Vrx3bMa9uMv8DCPb"], "tags": ["blackandwhite", "photographer", "nftart", "bw", "nude", "bnw", "artnude", "art", "keithallenphillips", "collection", "photography", "nft", "collectable", "beautiful", "nudity", "photo", "model"], "extra": {}}
