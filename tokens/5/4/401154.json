The monsters-kings on each floor have a different personality, form and background. The kings who rule the top floor of Hell give orders to those on the lower floors and keep Hell in order. The greatest king in the middle is the representation of a mythical beast that has not been seen by any other king yet. To be able to see and meet him, a king must kill all the other kings. However, since every king is immortal, this creates an impossible situation. \n\nDrawn on paper, colored in digital. 6000x3771 pixels, 2021. by Ahmet Ozcan", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaUyCqxUy3zdwKaif3wXiTQRPFnsgqvgPGVHpz6843CyH", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcQzPHWtXvSe75s7Fi7yC9FUgGC5DhCPfeFEKHSLTgZms", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaUyCqxUy3zdwKaif3wXiTQRPFnsgqvgPGVHpz6843CyH", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1hHGSjuggvJMjCipD573ip1pwooANWkHrq"], "tags": ["illustration", "painting", "monster"], "extra": {}}
