Tells what if Oddy enters the Star Wars universe. On the planet Mandalore, he trains and gets armor like Boba Fett who will go on a mission as a bounty hunter.\n\nI really love the comic cover art. Often, in art toy releases, I make issues with this type of work. With the intention of being a cover, or entrance to every theme created. For this fett edition, the toy version will be released in december via my bigcartel website. check my instagram @iky.z if you want to know information about the toy version.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmaUSL4zFvqieV2YkKXmBbGx5nZWTaKez5crC5UKHA6bSA", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbixUkQFFy1D6Kv3NyxBY5KP3QBZLnjRgrsLSBKK1PUah", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmaUSL4zFvqieV2YkKXmBbGx5nZWTaKez5crC5UKHA6bSA", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1WTu4A68oqxGCMAiQVjgui3yWXNtv3BwQh"], "tags": ["designertoy", "resintoy", "arttoy", "characterdesign", "illustration", "digitalart", "bobafett", "starwars", "scifi", "galaxy", "space", ""], "extra": {}}
