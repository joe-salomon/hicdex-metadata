It\u2019s all I aim to be.\nTo everyone I see or speak with, they will get to know me for better or for worse.\nI\u2019ve been hidden so long that I\u2019ll probably come off as a needy kid, striving for attention.\nBut I am sure as this continues, I will be forced to learn the eccentricities  in which to mask.\n\nWill this just be another cycle of a late social bloomer that slowly unravels back to a place of hiding? \nMaybe, But I hope not.\n", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmZsjDPSSD6xt5FiUGPsrWYhwESPBaAoCrNLfEjLKmeWnj", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPBFd42xk8CnYyVggcMmm7YagUhYCPiyoeRunYhmXtN3p", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmZsjDPSSD6xt5FiUGPsrWYhwESPBaAoCrNLfEjLKmeWnj", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1LiKcgzMA8E75vHtrr3wLk5Sx7r3GyMDNe"], "tags": ["poetry", "visual", "spokenword", "trippy", "psychedelic", "thought-provoking", "internaldebate"], "extra": {}}
