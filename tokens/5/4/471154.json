The CAB NFT community is world-renowned for its charity work and selfless acts.  \u2028\u2028\n\nTransparency is the key currency.  \n\n\u2028\u2028People no longer have to second guess governments.  Banking is no longer \u2018hide-and-go-seek'. Everything is out in the open.  \n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to take \u2018bribes\u2019 anymore.  No more middle-man.   The world is DAO run.\u2028\u2028\n\nThe Grow Group, IDO platform \u2018Equinox\u2019, CAB and our very own \u2018Starseed\u2019 brand -  thanks to their incredible communities - have exposed the bad actors in the crypto industry. The industry is now humming along with excitement. \u2028\n\nBack in 2021, NFT\u2019s were a simple way for anyone to enter \u2018crypto\u2019. They helped to bring \u2018crypto\u2019 to the universe.  Provably authentic. Transparent provenance. Secure yet globally and instantly accessible. Royalty monetization for creatives, enhanced liquidity are just some of the benefits of NFT\u2019s.\u2028\u2028\n\nThank you once again for being part of the change.  \u2028\u2028\n\nLong live CAB, NOX, GROW, EQUINOX and their awesome communities.   \u2028\n\nLove\n\n\nStarseed ", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmU5EyAQ1ZMH7G2Ztr2kHu1Lxr1cq14g7qLsuH8oGi1xKZ", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmYJsDRhvAYbwohtC7gybL3fenXjXj6smk7dsQjwMzXnhz", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmU5EyAQ1ZMH7G2Ztr2kHu1Lxr1cq14g7qLsuH8oGi1xKZ", "mimeType": "video/mp4"}], "creators": ["tz1g7wtAtGgwA68PS3VTeKm2mELk5efosM72"], "tags": ["CAB", "cryptoalienbabes", "equinox", "hopped", "Grow", "Nox"], "extra": {}}
