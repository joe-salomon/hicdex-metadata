{"__version": 1, "token_id": 510954, "symbol": "OBJKT", "name": "Squid Game 5", "description": "Welcome to squid game! Based off of the South Korean TV series.\n\nEach day, players are eliminated at random until one remains! The winner will receive a valued OBJKT as a prize, which you can click on the prize button to view.\n\nThe game will start 1 day after enough players have entered and a new round will take place every 24 hours. After 6 days the last player remaining will have the prize sent to their address.\n\nTo enter, simply collect the OBJKT. Buying on the secondary market will swap you with the earliest instance of the address you bought from, regardless of whether that place has been eliminated or not.\n\n\n** Disclaimer:\n\nThis is still in beta. The game depends upon the HicDex api, and if the api changes it will likely not work. I make no guarantee that the game will be completed and a prize will be rewarded.\n\nThe randomizer is seeded by the total number of objkts minted on the days after the contest begins and is not determined beforehand, meaning I have absolutely no control over who wins.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://Qmdtec8bw3jHnHpRNnLKC9C24K4jNdGHT9FjmRcZocXzcn", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmcMN1Rbdfa8GGGBAjG6ctgw6d7T2LjUZZoEuNwYYntZQy", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://Qmdtec8bw3jHnHpRNnLKC9C24K4jNdGHT9FjmRcZocXzcn", "mimeType": "application/x-directory"}], "creators": ["tz1UT9xFATwBZN9qwMa4YsoRWGKpVpnPMoui"], "tags": ["squidgamev5", "game", "interactive", "html", "css", "javascript", "prize", "squidgame"], "extra": {}}
