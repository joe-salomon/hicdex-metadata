The destructive angel shouts this name: \"Eat me until you die!\" And this well describes the fungi of the Amanita family.\n\nThis fungus contains a lethal dose of amatoxin and is responsible for a large proportion of fungal deaths. The first signs of poisoning with this fungus are muscle cramps, delirium, seizures, vomiting and diarrhea that appear within a day. Unfortunately, at that time, toxins may be absorbed into the body and cause irreversible damage to the kidneys, especially the liver tissue. Liver transplantation may be the only option for the patient to survive at this stage.", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmNhVymbknakUzKg67dGSCwL8mSe2DGi2AzgKSsiuBuNBS", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmNhVymbknakUzKg67dGSCwL8mSe2DGi2AzgKSsiuBuNBS", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmNhVymbknakUzKg67dGSCwL8mSe2DGi2AzgKSsiuBuNBS", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1cTCTRqt8vquyoq95LocqDgLfhtXCduwXK"], "tags": ["Minimalism", "mushrooms", "monochrome", "B&W", "shape", "conceptual", "concept", "building", "cleannfts", "nft", "infection", "nfts", "cryptoart", "algorithmic", "octaine", "green", "geometric", "processing", "cleannft", "particle", "subtle", "circle", "generative", "objkt", "pomegranate", "python", "white", "black", "interactive", "hen200k", "object4objekt", "abstract", "glitchart", "noise", "fluid", "nftartist", "trippy", "Dimensions", "3d", "Freemasonry", "light", "eye", "way", "travel", "dimensions", "nature", "Photography", ""], "extra": {}}
