Abstraction 04 is dedicated to the \"Metaball\", \"Voronoi diagram\" and \"Delaunay triangulation\" as well. Transformations are operated in different ways. The patterns are linked with each other according to the energy of main triggers of abstract processes to draw the algorithmic abstract artwork.  Relationship of algorithms is realized with eleven charged points as main triggers which are divided in two groups and are transforming the space around. Captured as a raw data from the custom \"node\" based algorithm. There is no post-processing behind.
