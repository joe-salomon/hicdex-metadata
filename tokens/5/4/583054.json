I know very little about quantum physics, but since I discovered it it has generated a lot of curiosity, something completely different from the conception that we have about the real world, breaking the standards of classical physics. Mandalas are my way of relaxation and experimentation that is becoming more and more frequent. I thought about representing in a piece of this style how I imagine the quantum world, which we are not able to understand easily.\n.\n\"We Must be clear that when it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry\"\n\n-Niels Bohr", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ5ZH1f7LZuJ1t99dHZf8ERiNQ7y833NnwjTRWBqtKT3q", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmbaKh7AYuPiNqWDfeUDcVM1k7XBBUUZzn64Tzu6mj4Uz9", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ5ZH1f7LZuJ1t99dHZf8ERiNQ7y833NnwjTRWBqtKT3q", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1i3T3yroaR1D3V7HY5oJyd6ZQoyNYxGheB"], "tags": ["Quantum", "green", "mandala", "sacred", "science", "blue", "atom"], "extra": {}}
