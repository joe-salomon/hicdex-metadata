They are relics from another time. And the people are often unknown \u2013 despite family ties.\n\n(Series 1)\n\nOfficial Website:\nhttps://peerkriesel.com/theunknownfamily", "artifact_uri": "ipfs://QmQ7FBEFZhV7VgmBxZMio1prP4Qk6MXcMEKN9spCvEVxzD", "display_uri": "ipfs://QmPzU9n6xD7AXdY1U8KQHiiFurXyDMeumeR7Q2NWT14UV7", "thumbnail_uri": "ipfs://QmNrhZHUaEqxhyLfqoq1mtHSipkWHeT31LNHb1QEbDHgnc", "formats": [{"uri": "ipfs://QmQ7FBEFZhV7VgmBxZMio1prP4Qk6MXcMEKN9spCvEVxzD", "mimeType": "image/jpeg"}], "creators": ["tz1SMkvJvX5BWR9HKwnV5LYttySD4gTACGh2"], "tags": ["TheUnknownFamilyPortraits", "TheUnknownPortraits", "TheUnknownFamily", "Portrait", "Abstract", "PeerKriesel", "DigitalPainting", "Abstraction", "Surrealism", "Art", "ContemporaryArt", "TheUnknownFamilyPortraits", "Generative", "GenerativeArt", "Random", "Automation"], "extra": {}}
