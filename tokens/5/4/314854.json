All artworks are created using custom algorithms in processing.\nThis collection has an abstract look at Iranian carpets, Iranian art-industrial carpets that have long overshadowed Iranian culture as a name and credit for Iran.\nOriginally, the roots of the kilim rug go back to the nomadic people of the Middle East. They served and still serve the nomads not necessarily as rugs, but rather as blankets, saddle blankets, seat mats, or wall decorations. It is believed that the first carpets in history, several hundred years before Christ, corresponded in many ways to today's kilim carpets. Since the original kilims are hand-woven, they also have a very important difference from knotted carpets. Knotting techniques have presumably only evolved from weaving techniques. Nowadays, kilims mostly originate from southern Iran or Afghanistan.\n\nKilims are so-called flatweaves and look almost identical from the top and bottom. They can thus be used on both sides, which is a great advantage over other types of carpets. They also have very distinctive patterns and designs. Thanks to the weaving technique with warp and weft, the patterns are linear and geometric. When the design elements are pulled apart, small holes are visible between them, which also results from the weaving technique. Typical are strong Colours that are extracted from plants and minerals like Persian carpets. Thus, original kilims from the Middle East are 100% natural products. There are very robust and rather thick kilims, which can be placed without problems in much-frequented rooms. Thinner variants often require an anti-slip underlay, but can also be transported quickly and easily and, for example, laid out for a picnic in the garden in summer.\nOn the left side, for example, you can see a Kilim Fars from the south of Iran. Kilim Fars carpets usually resemble the typical appearance of Persian rugs, because they have the same origin.\nThe handwoven Kilim Fars combines Persian patterns with the old tradition of flat fabrics. It represents a beautiful composition of contemporary Persian elements and a modern style. Due to the carpet's geometric patterns and its warm colors, this type of rug is extremely popular in modern interior magazines.
