I find it ironic that in 2015/2016 Trump was saying he wanted to \"Drain the Swamp\", alluding to Washington being overrun by corrupt politicians. Hot News Flash...oh he drained the swamp like a sponge became the swamp itself and like a gremlin he multiplied when the swamp water touched his skin. Is this good art though Andrew? I say yes, because it's a moment in history that needs to be seared into the memories of those who live on. This is a feat of endurance and an exercise into the futility of understanding American politics.
